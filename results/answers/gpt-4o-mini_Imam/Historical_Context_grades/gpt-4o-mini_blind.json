The references given from both Isaiah and Amos are relevant and support the discussion well.\n- However, the comparison to Islamic teachings in the conclusion is not relevant to the question which specifically asked for biblical events. It would be more appropriate to focus on reinforcing the Christian worldview without bringing in comparisons to other religions in this context.\n- The explanation could be further strengthened by delving deeper into the theological significance of the remnant concept in relation to God's covenant and faithfulness. Additionally, connecting the remnant theme to Christological implications could enrich the response from a Christian perspective."
