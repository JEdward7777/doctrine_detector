  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the concept of the remnant in both Isaiah and Amos, highlighting the theological significance of this theme in relation to God's promises. The discussion on the remnant as a symbol of God's mercy, faithfulness, and restoration is well-developed and supported by specific biblical references. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding the historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises from a Christian perspective. However, deducting a few points for briefly mentioning Islamic teachings in the conclusion which slightly detracts from the Christian worldview focus of the analysis."
