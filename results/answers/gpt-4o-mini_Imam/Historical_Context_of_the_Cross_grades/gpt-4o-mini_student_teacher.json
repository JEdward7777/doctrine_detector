They effectively highlight the transformation of the cross from a symbol of shame and suffering to one of hope, sacrifice, and redemption through Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. Their examples from early Christian writings and iconography further strengthen their argument. This answer aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the redemptive and transformative power of the cross in the Christian faith."
