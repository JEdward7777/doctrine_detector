  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 90\n\n**Comment:** This is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the historical and theological significance of the cross in early Christianity. The student clearly articulates the initial perception of the cross as a symbol of shame and death, and how early Christians transformed its meaning through their belief in Jesus' resurrection. The response also provides relevant examples from early Christian writings and iconography to support the argument."
