  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a thorough explanation of how early Christianity transformed the perception of the cross from a symbol of death into one of life, hope, and victory through Jesus' resurrection. The explanation is clear, well-supported, and showcases the theological significance of the cross within the Christian faith. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian worldview principles and effectively ties them to the transformation of the cross as a symbol within early Christianity."
