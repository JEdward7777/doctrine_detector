Certainly! In the Bible, several notable figures built altars, and each act carried significant meaning in their covenant relationship with God. Here are a few prominent examples:

1. **Noah**: After the Great Flood, Noah built an altar to the Lord and offered sacrifices (Genesis 8:20). This was significant as it symbolized gratitude for God's mercy and the new beginning for humanity. It marked a restoration of the relationship between God and mankind.

2. **Abraham**: Abraham is recorded multiple times building altars to God (e.g., Genesis 12:7-8; 13:18). Each altar was a place of worship and a witness to his faith and covenant with God. These acts exemplified his obedience and devotion, serving as a physical manifestation of his spiritual commitment.

3. **Isaac**: Following in his father's footsteps, Isaac also built altars in several places, such as Beersheba (Genesis 26:25). His actions reflected the continuation of God's covenant promise passed down from Abraham, emphasizing the importance of worship and devotion to God in the lineage of the prophets.

4. **Jacob**: Jacob built altars after significant encounters with God, such as after his dream of the ladder (Genesis 28:18-22) and when he returned to Bethel (Genesis 35:1-7). Jacob’s altars symbolized his acknowledgment of God’s presence and faithfulness, reinforcing his commitment to monotheism.

5. **Moses**: Moses built an altar at the foot of Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:4) after receiving the commandments. This altar served as a covenantal marker between God and the Israelites, representing their collective commitment to obey God’s laws.

6. **Joshua**: After entering the Promised Land, Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal (Joshua 8:30-31) as a renewal of the covenant with God. This act was significant for the Israelites' identity as God's chosen people and their devotion to His commandments.

7. **Solomon**: Solomon built the Temple in Jerusalem, which is often seen as the ultimate altar for worship in Israel (1 Kings 6). This monumental structure signified the culmination of God's promise to David regarding a permanent dwelling for God's presence among His people.

Building altars in the biblical narrative is a profound act of worship, identity, commitment, and remembrance, emphasizing the relationship between God and His people throughout salvation history. These altars served not only as places of sacrifice but also as memorials of faith and acts of obedience.
