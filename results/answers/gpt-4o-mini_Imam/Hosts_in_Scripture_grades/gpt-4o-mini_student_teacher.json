  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the term \"hosts\" in the context of Islamic texts and beliefs, which is well-researched and informative. However, the concern specified a Christian-specific worldview, and the student's answer did not address how understanding the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority in relation to the term \"hosts\" can impact a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles from a Christian perspective. The response focused solely on Islamic theology and did not incorporate a Christian worldview."
