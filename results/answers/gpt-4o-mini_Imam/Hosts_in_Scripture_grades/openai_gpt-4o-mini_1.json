The explanation showcases an understanding of the term's various dimensions and significance within the Islamic context. However, to align more closely with a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to incorporate references to specific biblical passages related to spiritual warfare and divine authority, as this would deepen the analysis from a Christian perspective."
