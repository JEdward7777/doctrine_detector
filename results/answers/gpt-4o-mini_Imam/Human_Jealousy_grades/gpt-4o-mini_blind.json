It gives practical steps rooted in Islamic teachings, emphasizing self-reflection, seeking Allah's guidance, open communication, gratitude, trust, avoiding comparison, relying on Allah's wisdom, seeking knowledge, and considering professional help. However, the answer could have delved deeper into specific Islamic teachings that directly address jealousy, such as the concept of contentment with Allah's decree (qadr) and the importance of seeking forgiveness and making dua for purification of the heart. Additionally, integrating more direct references to the Quran and Hadith would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response."
