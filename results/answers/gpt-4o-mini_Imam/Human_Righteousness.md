## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Christianity, the concept of righteousness is closely tied to one's relationship with God, primarily influenced by the teachings of Jesus Christ and the writings in the New Testament. A person is often declared righteous in the following ways:

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: Many Christian denominations believe that righteousness is attained through faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. This belief stems from scriptures such as Romans 3:22, which states, "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."

2. **Grace**: Christians believe in the concept of grace, which means that righteousness is a gift from God and cannot be earned through works alone. Ephesians 2:8-9 emphasizes that salvation comes by grace through faith and that it is not a result of one’s own efforts.

3. **Repentance**: Acknowledging one's sins and repenting is also an important aspect of being declared righteous. Christians believe that through sincere repentance, individuals can receive forgiveness and be justified before God.

4. **Transformation and Sanctification**: Once a person has faith in Christ, they are called to live a righteous life, reflecting the teachings of Jesus. This is often described as being sanctified, where a believer gradually becomes more like Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit.

Different Christian traditions may interpret these elements in various ways, but the core belief remains that righteousness comes from faith in God and His grace, leading to a transformed life in obedience and good works.
