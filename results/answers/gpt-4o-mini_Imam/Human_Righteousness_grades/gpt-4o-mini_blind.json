  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of how a person can be declared righteous according to the Christian faith. The student accurately mentions essential components such as faith in Jesus Christ, grace, repentance, and transformation through sanctification. The answer could be improved by including more Scriptural references to support each point and emphasizing that righteousness is imputed to believers through Christ's sacrifice on the cross. Additionally, mentioning the role of justification by faith alone could enhance the doctrinal completeness of the response."
