  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how a person can be declared righteous according to the Christian faith. They correctly emphasize the importance of faith in Jesus Christ, grace, repentance, and transformation/sanctification. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the central aspect of trusting in Jesus for salvation and the imputation of Jesus' righteousness to believers. Emphasizing this core principle more directly would enhance the clarity and alignment with the Christian worldview, which is essential for understanding salvation."
