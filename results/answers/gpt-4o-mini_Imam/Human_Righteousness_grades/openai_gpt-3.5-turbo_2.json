  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of how a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ, in line with Christian teachings. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of trusting in Jesus for salvation and the imputation of His righteousness onto believers. The inclusion of relevant scripture references and key concepts like grace, repentance, and sanctification further support the explanation. Overall, a well-grounded and comprehensive response within a Christian worldview."
