  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response with practical steps to align actions with beliefs in the context of Islam. The suggestions are in line with Islamic teachings and emphasize the importance of self-awareness, intention, knowledge, accountability, and seeking forgiveness. The student effectively addressed the concern of hypocrisy leading to a loss of integrity and provided actionable solutions. However, the response could have benefitted from a more direct connection to seeking God's guidance through prayer as mentioned in the reference answer."
