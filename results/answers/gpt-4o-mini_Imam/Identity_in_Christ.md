## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
When God says, "I have called you by name," it conveys a deep sense of personal relationship and individual recognition. In the Islamic tradition, this concept can be understood in several ways:

1. **Individual Attention**: This phrase emphasizes that God is intimately aware of each individual. It suggests that God knows us personally, recognizing our unique attributes, struggles, and identities. It underscores His omniscience and the personal nature of our relationship with Him.

2. **Value and Dignity**: Calling someone by name signifies value and importance. In Islam, every individual is considered significant in the eyes of God, and this phrase reinforces the idea that each person's life and spiritual journey matter to Him.

3. **Guidance and Purpose**: By calling us by name, God also indicates that He has a purpose for each person. It can be a reminder that we are all called to fulfill a specific role in the world, whether it is through acts of worship, service to others, or living a life of righteousness.

4. **Invitation to Prayer and Reflection**: The act of being called by name can also serve as an invitation for believers to engage in prayer and reflection. It encourages introspection and a closer relationship with God, fostering an environment where we feel encouraged to communicate with Him and seek His guidance.

In summary, the phrase "I have called you by name" reflects God's knowledge of each person, affirms their importance, indicates an individual purpose, and invites deeper connection and devotion to Him.
