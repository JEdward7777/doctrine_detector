  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provided a thoughtful exploration of the concept of being called by name in Islam, highlighting aspects of individual attention, value, purpose, and invitation to prayer. However, the answer focused solely on Islamic perspectives without addressing the Christian understanding of this phrase. To improve the grade, the student could incorporate scriptural references or theological insights from a Christian perspective on how being called by name relates to God's personal relationship with His people, His sovereignty, and His redemptive plan."
