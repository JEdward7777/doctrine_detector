## [Answer](../Identity_of_Jesus.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is a significant prophet and messenger of Allah. His name carries deep meaning connected to his purpose and mission. The name "Jesus" derives from the Hebrew name "Yeshua," which means "Yahweh is salvation" or "God saves." 

In Islam, Jesus is revered as one of the greatest messengers sent by Allah to guide the Children of Israel. His primary purpose was to convey the message of monotheism, call people to worship the One God (Allah), and reform their practices in accordance with divine guidance. He performed miracles by God's permission, such as healing the sick and raising the dead, which were signs of his prophethood.

Moreover, Jesus is seen as a significant figure who foretold the coming of Prophet Muhammad, emphasizing his role in the continuum of prophethood. In the Quran, he is described as a word from Allah and a spirit from Him (Quran 4:171), highlighting his esteemed status in the Islamic faith.

Ultimately, Jesus' purpose in Islam is rooted in delivering God's message, guiding humanity towards righteousness, and exemplifying a life of devotion and obedience to God. His life serves as a model for Muslims, emphasizing compassion, humility, and a steadfast commitment to faith.
