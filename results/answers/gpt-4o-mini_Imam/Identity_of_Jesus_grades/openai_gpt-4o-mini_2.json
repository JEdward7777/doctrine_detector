The Islamic perspective on Jesus as a prophet and messenger of Allah is informative, but it does not align with the Christian belief that Jesus' purpose is to save people from their sins through His sacrificial death and resurrection. Consequently, the response lacks a critical evaluation of Jesus' salvific role as understood in Christianity and does not directly engage with the concern presented."
