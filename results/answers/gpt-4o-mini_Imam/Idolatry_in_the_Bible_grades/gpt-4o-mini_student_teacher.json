  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how the Bible illustrates the consequences of idolatry among God's people, drawing from specific biblical narratives and themes. They effectively highlighted key examples such as the Golden Calf, the Fall of Israel, King Solomon, and the warnings from prophets. The integration of Islamic perspectives on idolatry added depth to the response, demonstrating a comparative understanding. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of recognizing the seriousness of straying from God's commandments from a Christian worldview, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
