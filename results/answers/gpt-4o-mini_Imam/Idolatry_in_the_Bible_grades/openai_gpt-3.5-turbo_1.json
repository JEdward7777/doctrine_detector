The inclusion of specific examples such as the Golden Calf, the Fall of Israel, King Solomon, prophetic warnings, and the Book of Revelation demonstrates a deep understanding of how idolatry is viewed in the Bible. Additionally, the comparison drawn between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on idolatry further enhances the analysis. An excellent integration of Christian worldview in evaluating the consequences of idolatry."
