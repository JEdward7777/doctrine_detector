  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the importance of proclaiming the \"good news\" from a Christian perspective. It provides a well-reasoned and comprehensive analysis of various motivations and implications of this practice. The student's ability to connect the concept with Jesus' command and the urgency of sharing the message of salvation is particularly noteworthy. However, including a direct reference to the teacher's provided answer would have elevated the grade further."
