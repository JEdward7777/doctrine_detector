  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained analysis of how the Sadducees and Pharisees influenced the decision to crucify Jesus. They accurately described the beliefs and actions of both groups, showing a good understanding of the historical and biblical context. The answer effectively highlights key character traits such as protectiveness of authority, hypocrisy, and fear of change demonstrated by the religious leaders. The response could have been improved by directly connecting the influence of the Sadducees and Pharisees to the Roman leaders in the crucifixion of Jesus, as the reference answer points out. Overall, a strong and insightful response with a Christian worldview perspective."
