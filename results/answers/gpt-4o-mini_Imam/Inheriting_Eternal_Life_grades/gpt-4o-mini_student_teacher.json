  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general overview of how the concept of eternal life is addressed in the Bible, but their response lacks focus on the teachings of Jesus specifically as the path to inheriting eternal life. It also includes information on Islamic theology, which is irrelevant to the question asked from a Christian worldview perspective. The student needs to concentrate on the teachings of Jesus as the central aspect of salvation according to the Bible."
