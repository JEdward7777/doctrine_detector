## [Answer](../Inheriting_Eternal_Life.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the question of inheriting eternal life is addressed in a few key passages. One notable instance is in the Gospel of Mark (10:17-21), where a rich young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus responds by first listing the commandments and then tells the young man to sell all that he has, give to the poor, and follow Him.

Another significant passage can be found in the Gospel of John (3:16), which states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus.

In the context of Islamic theology, we believe that the concept of eternal life is tied to faith in Allah (God) and living a righteous life according to His guidance, as conveyed through the Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). In Islam, the emphasis is on faith (Iman) and righteous deeds (Amal Salih) being essential for success in the Hereafter.

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical passages relevant to the question. It also acknowledges the Islamic perspective on the concept of eternal life, demonstrating cultural sensitivity. However, the response could benefit from explicitly mentioning Jesus' sacrifice as the key to inheritance of eternal life, as emphasized in the reference answer.
