  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80. \n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and well-reasoned response to the question, drawing parallels between the biblical concept of innocent blood and Islamic teachings on the value of life. The student effectively highlighted key passages from the Bible that address the concept of innocent blood and presented a thoughtful analysis on the implications for the value of life. Additionally, the student demonstrated an understanding of how the concept of innocent blood can lead to deeper discussions on justice, righteousness, and moral implications. \n\nHowever, the student could have further strengthened their answer by providing more direct references to specific biblical verses that explicitly address the concept of innocent blood, similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher. This would have helped to enhance the student's analysis and support their points more effectively."
