The student effectively addressed the concern by focusing on how choices, supplication, intentions, repentance, trust, and community support influence one's connection with Allah and His plan. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the Christian-specific concern regarding how choices influence the unfolding of God's plans and the relationship Christians have with Him. The response also could have incorporated more explicitly Christian theological concepts, scriptures, or examples to better align with a Christian worldview."
