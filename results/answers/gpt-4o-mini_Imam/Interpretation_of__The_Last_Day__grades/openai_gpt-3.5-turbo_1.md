# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Christian teaching, "the Last Day" often refers to the final day of judgment, when all of humanity will be resurrected and held accountable for their lives. This belief is closely tied to eschatology, which is the study of the end times and the ultimate destiny of humanity.

On the Last Day, it is believed that Jesus Christ will return to judge the living and the dead. This day is associated with the concepts of resurrection, final judgment, and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom. Those who have followed Christ and lived righteously are believed to inherit eternal life, while others will face separation from God.

While this belief aligns with some aspects of Islamic eschatology, such as the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah), there are differences in the details and interpretations between the two faiths. In Islam, the Day of Judgment also emphasizes resurrection and accountability, where individuals are judged based on their beliefs and actions during their earthly lives.
