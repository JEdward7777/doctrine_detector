While the content is well-developed and thorough, it does not directly address the concern regarding how Christians express reverence and awe towards God. The perspective presented aligns with Islamic beliefs but does not incorporate a Christian worldview, which is necessary for fully addressing the concern. A more comprehensive response would have included a comparison or contrast with Christian perspectives on divine glory in worship practices."
