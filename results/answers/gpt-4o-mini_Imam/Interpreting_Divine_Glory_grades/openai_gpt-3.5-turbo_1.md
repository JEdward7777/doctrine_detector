# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islam, 'divine glory' (or 'Jalāl' in Arabic) refers to the majesty, greatness, and perfection of Allah (God). Understanding divine glory in the context of worship involves recognizing the attributes and qualities of Allah that inspire reverence, awe, and a deep sense of humility among believers. Here are some key points to consider:

### 1. **Recognition of Greatness**  
Divine glory highlights the greatness of Allah as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. In worship, Muslims acknowledge His unparalleled power, wisdom, and knowledge. This understanding fosters a sense of humility, as believers recognize their dependence on Allah and their limitations as human beings.

### 2. **Encouragement to Worship**  
The recognition of divine glory serves as motivation for worship. When Muslims contemplate the magnificence of Allah, it inspires them to turn to Him in servitude, prayer, and submission. Worship is an expression of gratitude and love for Allah’s attributes, including His mercy, forgiveness, and majesty.

### 3. **Reflection in Acts of Worship**  
In the practices of worship, such as the five daily prayers (Salah), fasting (Sawm), and recitation of the Quran, Muslims express their reverence for Allah's glory. Each act of worship is designed to reinforce the connection between the believer and the divine, reinforcing the idea that Allah's glory must be celebrated through obedience and devotion.

### 4. **Understanding Cosmic Order**  
The belief in divine glory also reflects the order and balance established by Allah in creation. Worship acknowledges this cosmic order and the signs of Allah's greatness present in nature and life itself, which leads to a greater appreciation for the world around us and our place in it.

### 5. **Seeking Forgiveness and Mercy**  
While divine glory emphasizes Allah’s greatness, it also reminds believers of His mercy and forgiveness. The acknowledgment of Allah’s glorious nature encourages Muslims to seek forgiveness for their shortcomings, fully aware that no one is free from sin, yet they remain hopeful in Allah's mercy.

### 6. **Unity of Divine Attributes**  
In theological terms, divine glory is one of many attributes of Allah, including compassion, justice, and wisdom. Understanding these attributes together paints a holistic picture of who Allah is, further enriching the worship experience by acknowledging His multifaceted nature.

### 7. **Community and Collective Worship**  
When Muslims come together for congregational prayers and community events, the collective recognition of divine glory reinforces communal bonds. It reminds the community of their shared beliefs, values, and the ultimate purpose of life, which is to worship Allah.

In summary, understanding divine glory in worship is about recognizing Allah's majesty, which inspires sincere devotion, action, and the pursuit of closeness to Him. It encourages believers to live in a way that reflects their understanding of Allah’s greatness in all facets of life.
