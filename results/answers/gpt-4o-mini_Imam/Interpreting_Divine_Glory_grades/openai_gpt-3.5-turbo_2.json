While it effectively highlights the recognition of God's greatness, motivation for worship, reflection in acts of worship, understanding of cosmic order, seeking forgiveness and mercy, unity of divine attributes, and the importance of community in worship, there is a lack of direct comparison or integration of how the concept of divine glory in Islam relates to the Christian concern provided. A stronger connection between the Islamic perspective presented and the Christian context outlined would have further enhanced the response."
