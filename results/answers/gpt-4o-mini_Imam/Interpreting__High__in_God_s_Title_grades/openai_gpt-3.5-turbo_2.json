It successfully addresses the concern by clarifying that \"High\" denotes greatness and authority rather than physical height, thus highlighting the metaphorical use of descriptive titles in understanding God's nature. The response effectively integrates a Christian worldview by acknowledging the importance of recognizing God's supremacy and attributes without misconceptions, aligning with the biblical emphasis on God's greatness and sovereignty."
