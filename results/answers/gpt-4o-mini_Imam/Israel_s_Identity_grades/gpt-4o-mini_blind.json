It correctly identifies the Hebrew root and its meaning, connects it to the patriarch Jacob, and explains the transition from Jacob to Israel after his encounter with the divine being. The answer effectively articulates the spiritual and covenantal dimensions of the name within the biblical narrative. Great job!"
