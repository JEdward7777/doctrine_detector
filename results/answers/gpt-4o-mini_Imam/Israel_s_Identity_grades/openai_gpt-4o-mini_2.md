## [Answer](../Israel_s_Identity.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of its biblical origin, the name "Israel" carries significant meaning and historical importance. The name is derived from the Hebrew root "s-r-l," which is often understood to mean "to struggle" or "to contend." 

Biblically, the name is associated with the patriarch Jacob. According to the Book of Genesis (32:28), after a night of wrestling with a divine being, Jacob was given the name "Israel," which can be interpreted as "one who struggles with God" or "he who prevails with God." This moment signifies a transformative encounter and marks Jacob's change from being known as Jacob to being known as Israel.

The name also signifies the collective identity of the descendants of Jacob, who became known as the Israelites. Thus, in the biblical narrative, Israel represents both the individual (Jacob) and the nation that emerged from his lineage, highlighting themes of struggle, perseverance, and divine favor. In this context, Israel is not only a geographical or political term but also a spiritual and covenantal identity linked to the promises made by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
