However, while the answer is thorough, it veered off from the Christian faith perspective by including the viewpoint of Muslims and discussing the relevance of the narrative for them. A more focused response solely from a Christian worldview discussing God's guidance and provision for His people in the journey would have aligned better with the given concern."
