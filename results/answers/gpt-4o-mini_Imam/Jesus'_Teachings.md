## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the teachings of Jesus, the term "amen" is used to affirm the truthfulness and seriousness of His statements. In the Gospels, Jesus often begins key statements with "Amen, Amen," which can be translated as "Truly, truly" or "Verily, verily." This repetition emphasizes the importance of what He is about to say, highlighting its truth and significance.

The use of "amen" in this way serves a few purposes:

1. **Authority**: By using "amen" at the beginning of His statements, Jesus asserts His authority as a teacher. He is not just relaying information from others but is speaking with divine truth and certainty.

2. **Witnessing**: The repetition of "amen" serves as a form of witness to the truth of His teachings, inviting His listeners to pay attention and internalize His message.

3. **Call to Faith**: It encourages the audience to respond with belief, underscoring the importance of faith in His teachings.

In the Quran, the concept of truthfulness and the importance of divine authority is also emphasized, although the context and usage may differ from that in the Gospels. Both traditions acknowledge the significance of affirming truth in matters of faith and the centrality of divine messages.
