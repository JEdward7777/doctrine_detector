  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation of the offer of wine mixed with myrrh in the context of the crucifixion and discussed the significance of Jesus' suffering and sacrifice from both Christian and Islamic perspectives. However, the student included unnecessary information about Islamic theology that somewhat detracted from the focus on Jesus' experience on the cross. Additionally, the student did not directly address the specific concern of reflecting on Jesus' refusal leading to deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission."
