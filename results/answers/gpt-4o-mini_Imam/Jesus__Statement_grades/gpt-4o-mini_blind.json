  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provides a decent overview of the Christian perspective on Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life,\" emphasizing His divine authority over life and death and the concept of eternal life through faith in Him. However, the answer falls short in emphasizing the unique Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the second person of the Trinity, which is crucial for understanding the full depth of His statement. The student could improve the grade by focusing more on the hypostatic union of Christ as both fully divine and fully human, and how this unique identity informs His role as the source of resurrection and eternal life."
