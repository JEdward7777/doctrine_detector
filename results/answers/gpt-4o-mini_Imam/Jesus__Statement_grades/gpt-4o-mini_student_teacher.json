  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" from a Christian perspective, emphasizing Jesus' divine authority over life and death. However, there is a significant deviation from the Christian worldview when the student brings in Islamic theology, which may cause confusion and dilute the focus on Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. It is important to maintain a clear Christian-specific explanation without blending in beliefs from other religions when addressing matters of faith and theological understanding."
