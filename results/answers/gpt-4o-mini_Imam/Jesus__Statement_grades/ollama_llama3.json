  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nWhile the response touches on some key points, such as Jesus' statement being attributed to John 11:25 and the significance of his role in salvation, it falls short in fully clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. The initial answer provided does not adequately capture the richness of Jesus' words or their implications for faith and theological understanding.\n\nThe response also could have done a better job exploring the nuances between Christian and Islamic understandings of resurrection, rather than simply stating the differences. Additionally, the discussion could have benefited from more explicit references to scriptural passages and theological concepts.\n\nHowever, the response does demonstrate an attempt to engage with both Christian and Islamic perspectives on resurrection, which is commendable. With further development and attention to clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, this response has potential for growth and improvement."
