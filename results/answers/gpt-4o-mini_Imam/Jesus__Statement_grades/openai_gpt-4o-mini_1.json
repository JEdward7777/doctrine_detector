The comparison with Islamic theology adds depth to the explanation. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the unique Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the implications of this for the understanding of resurrection and eternal life. Nonetheless, the response effectively addresses the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection within a Christian worldview."
