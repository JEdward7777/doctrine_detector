  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComments: The student provides a solid explanation of how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings, highlighting its significance and the purposes it serves. The response effectively connects the use of \"amen\" with Jesus' authority as a teacher, the witness to truth in His teachings, and the call to faith. However, the mention of the Quran and its emphasis on truthfulness and divine authority, while academically interesting, is not directly relevant to the question asked, which focuses specifically on Jesus' use of \"amen.\" For a more focused and precise response, the student could have omitted the reference to the Quran and expanded on how the use of \"amen\" by Jesus is unique within the Christian context."
