  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings, highlighting the concepts of truthfulness, authority, and the call to faith. However, there was a missed opportunity to specifically focus on recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings as outlined in Scripture. The student could have further emphasized the unique nature of Jesus' authority as the Son of God. Nevertheless, the response provided valuable insights and connections between the use of \"amen\" in the Gospels and its significance in affirming truth in matters of faith."
