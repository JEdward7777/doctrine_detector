  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately describes the use of \"amen\" in Jesus' teachings, highlighting its role in emphasizing truth and authority. It also effectively connects the concept to the themes of witness and call to faith. The comparison with the Quran is a nice touch, demonstrating an understanding of the broader scriptural context.\n\nHowever, while the response generally stays on track in terms of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings, it could delve deeper into this concern. For example, it might explore how Jesus' use of \"amen\" specifically reflects His divine authority or how this phrase contributes to a sense of awe and reverence for God's word.\n\nOverall, the response is well-organized and provides a clear explanation of the concept. With some further development on the concern of recognizing Jesus' authority, it could be even more effective in conveying its message."
