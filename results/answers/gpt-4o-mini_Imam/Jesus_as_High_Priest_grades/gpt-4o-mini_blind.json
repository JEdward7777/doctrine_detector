However, it lacks doctrinal correctness by not emphasizing Jesus as the unique and ultimate High Priest who offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice for sins. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the significance of Jesus' priesthood in relation to human priests in Christianity, illustrating the fulfillment and surpassing of the Old Testament sacrificial system. The answer could also benefit from a clearer presentation of Christian theology surrounding priesthood and sacrifice."
