## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, Jesus is described as having a unique priestly role that surpasses the traditional high priesthood of the Jewish leaders. The book of Hebrews is particularly significant in this context, as it draws connections between Jesus and the priestly order.

1. **High Priest According to the Order of Melchizedek**: Hebrews 5:5-6 states, "So also Christ did not glorify himself to become a high priest, but it was he who said to him, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten you'; as he says also in another place, 'You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.'" This implies that Jesus is a high priest not in the Levitical line (descendants of Aaron) but rather in the order of Melchizedek, a figure who appears in Genesis and is described as both a king and a priest.

2. **Mediator of a New Covenant**: Hebrews further elaborates that Jesus is the mediator of a new covenant (Hebrews 9:15). This new covenant is established through His sacrificial death, which is viewed as a fulfillment and replacement of the old sacrificial system.

3. **Perfect High Priest**: Hebrews 4:14-15 highlights that Jesus is a high priest who can empathize with human weaknesses, as He was tempted in every way yet did not sin. This underscores His unique position as someone who understands human struggles while being sinless.

4. **Permanent Priesthood**: Unlike the Levitical priests who would die and need replacements, Jesus' priesthood is permanent due to His eternal nature (Hebrews 7:24-25). This guarantees that He is always available to intercede for believers.

In summary, in the New Testament, Jesus is depicted as a high priest who fulfills and supersedes the Levitical priesthood, offering a new way for believers to relate to God through His perfect sacrifice and eternal intercession.
