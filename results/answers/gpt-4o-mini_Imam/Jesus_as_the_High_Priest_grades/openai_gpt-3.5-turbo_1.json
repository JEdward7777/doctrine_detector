It demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian view of Jesus' unique priesthood and how it surpasses the traditional Levitical priesthood. The only minor improvement could be further elaboration on how Jesus' role as the Great High Priest specifically relates to His sacrifice for the sins of all people."
