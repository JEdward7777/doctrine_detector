# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the New Testament, Jesus' engagement with the synagogue was a significant aspect of His ministry. Although the Qur'an does not provide detailed accounts of Jesus' (known as Isa in Islam) life and ministry, we can draw insights from the Christian texts that highlight His activities.

1. **Teaching and Preaching**: Jesus frequently visited synagogues to teach. For instance, in Luke 4:16-21, it is recorded that Jesus read from the scroll of Isaiah in the synagogue in Nazareth and proclaimed that the scripture was fulfilled in Him. This event highlights His role as a teacher and His approach to interpreting the Hebrew scriptures.

2. **Healing**: Jesus performed healings in the synagogues, demonstrating His authority and compassion. An example of this is found in Luke 13:10-17, where He healed a woman who had been crippled for eighteen years while teaching in the synagogue on the Sabbath, thus emphasizing His mission to bring relief and healing.

3. **Controversy with Religious Leaders**: Jesusâ€™ teachings sometimes conflicted with the prevailing interpretations of the Law and traditions upheld by the religious leaders of the time. His actions and teachings often led to disputes within the synagogue, as seen in Mark 3:1-6, where He healed a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, drawing criticism from the Pharisees.

4. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**: Jesus also engaged with the synagogue as a place where He could assert His identity as the Messiah. His interpretations of scripture often pointed to fulfillment of Jewish prophecies, which would have been discussed in the synagogue context.

In a Muslim understanding, while we respect and acknowledge the significant role Jesus played in the Scriptures and His connection to the Jewish tradition, it is also essential to remember that Islam teaches that Jesus was a prophet who preached the oneness of God (Tawhid) and called people to righteousness, akin to the broader messages found in the Qur'an.
