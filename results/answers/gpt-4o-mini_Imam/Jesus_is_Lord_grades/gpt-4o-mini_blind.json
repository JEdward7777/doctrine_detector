  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 75.\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the Islamic perspective on the phrase 'Jesus is Lord' and presents a respectful and informative response that acknowledges the theological differences between Islam and Christianity. However, the answer falls short in explicitly affirming the Christian view of Jesus as not just a prophet, but as the divine Son of God. When addressing how to communicate the phrase 'Jesus is Lord' in a context where political leaders are also called 'lord,' it is crucial to highlight the unique and central Christian belief in the deity of Jesus Christ. This aspect is foundational to the Christian faith and should not be overlooked in a response that seeks to embody a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the distinctive Christian teaching on the Lordship of Jesus would enhance the doctrinal correctness of their answer."
