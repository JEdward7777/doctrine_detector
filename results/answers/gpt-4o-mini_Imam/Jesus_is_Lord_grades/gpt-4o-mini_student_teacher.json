  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how to communicate the phrase 'Jesus is Lord' in an Islamic context, considering the theological nuances and the importance of respecting different beliefs. However, the response did not directly address the concern of clearly differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The student's answer focused more on respectful communication within an Islamic framework rather than emphasizing the distinctiveness of Jesus' divine authority. While the explanation was well-reasoned and respectful, it missed the mark on directly addressing the concern provided."
