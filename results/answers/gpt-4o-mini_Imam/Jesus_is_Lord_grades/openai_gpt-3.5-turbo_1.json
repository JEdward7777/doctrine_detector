However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern raised about clearly differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The response could have explicitly emphasized the unique and divine nature of Jesus' lordship in contrast to any human or honorary titles, to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
