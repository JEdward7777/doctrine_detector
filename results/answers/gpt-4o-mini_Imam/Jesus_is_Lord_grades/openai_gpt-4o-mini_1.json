It maintains respect for Islamic beliefs while emphasizing the Christian perspective on Jesus' divine authority. The response could be strengthened by explicitly stating the Christian understanding of Jesus as both fully human and fully divine, to further clarify the distinction between earthly rulers and Jesus' unique role as Lord."
