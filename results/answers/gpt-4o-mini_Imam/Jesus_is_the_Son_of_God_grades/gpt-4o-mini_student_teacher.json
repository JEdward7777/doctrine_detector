  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer attempts to navigate the sensitive issue of translating the concept of Jesus as the Son of God into a Muslim context by emphasizing Islamic beliefs while avoiding offense. However, the student falls short in fully maintaining the original terminology as requested by the reference answer. While the student provides a respectful and accurate explanation of Islamic beliefs, they could have incorporated more teaching and context to explain the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God. This response could be improved by balancing accuracy with clarity on the Christian perspective."
