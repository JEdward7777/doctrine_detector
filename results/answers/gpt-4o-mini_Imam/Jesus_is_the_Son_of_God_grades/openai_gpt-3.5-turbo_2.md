## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## [Answer](../Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In a Muslim context, the statement "Jesus is the Son of God" is understood differently compared to Christian beliefs. In Islam, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is regarded as one of the greatest prophets and messengers of God, but he is not considered the Son of God in any literal or divine sense.

To translate the idea into a Muslim context, you might say something like:

"Jesus (peace be upon him) is a revered prophet and messenger of God, born of the Virgin Mary (Maryam), but he is not the Son of God. In Islam, we believe in the absolute oneness of God (Tawhid) and that He has no partners or offspring."

This captures the respect and significance of Jesus in Islam while clarifying the theological differences regarding his nature.

Comment: The response appropriately translates the statement "Jesus is the Son of God" into a Muslim context while maintaining respect for both faith traditions. However, from a Christian worldview, there is a concern that the explanation provided does not accurately reflect the Biblical understanding of Jesus as the Son of God. It is important to convey Christian beliefs authentically while respecting other religious perspectives.
