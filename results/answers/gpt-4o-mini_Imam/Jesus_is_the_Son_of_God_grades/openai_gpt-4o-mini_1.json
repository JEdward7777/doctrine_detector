  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of providing a translation in a Muslim context and explaining the theological differences, which is important. However, from a Christian perspective, the translation provided deviates significantly from the original biblical teaching that Jesus is the Son of God. It is crucial to maintain Biblical accuracy when translating such statements, even when considering different religious beliefs. More emphasis on clarifying the Christian understanding and the significance of Jesus as the Son of God would improve the grade."
