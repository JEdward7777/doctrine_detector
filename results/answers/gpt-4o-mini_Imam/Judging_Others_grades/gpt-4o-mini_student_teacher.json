  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response by drawing parallels between interfaith dialogue and Christian teachings on judgment. However, the answer could have been more focused on addressing the specific instructions from the Bible regarding how Christians should judge each other, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, while the student did touch on the importance of love, understanding, humility, and self-awareness, a more direct citation of relevant Bible verses would have strengthened the response."
