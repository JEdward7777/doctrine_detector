  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding judgment, which although informative, deviated significantly from the given concern of addressing the biblical perspective. The answer did not directly relate to the core Christian belief that individuals will be judged based on their actions and lives in relation to the righteous character of Christ. The student's response lacked adequate focus on the specific question posed, resulting in a lower grade."
