However, the response is primarily based on Islamic teachings rather than Christian theology. While the similarities between Islamic and Christian beliefs are noteworthy, the student could have provided more direct references to Christian sources to support their claims. Additionally, the response could have elaborated more on the specific criteria used in Christian theology for judgment."
