## [Answer](../Judgment_Criteria.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
According to Islamic belief, the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah) is a fundamental tenet where every individual will be held accountable for their deeds. While I can provide insight based on Islamic texts, I understand your question pertains to the biblical perspective. However, from an Islamic standpoint, I can highlight how judgment is viewed within our own teachings.

In Islam, it is believed that every person will be judged by Allah based on their faith (iman) and actions (amal). The Quran mentions that individuals will be presented with their deeds, and they will be judged with justice. Those who have done righteous deeds and believed in the oneness of Allah will find mercy and reward, while those who rejected faith and committed sinful acts without repentance may face consequences.

The Quran states in Surah Al-Zalzalah (Chapter 99) that:

> "When the earth is shaken with its quake, and the earth discloses its burdens (the deeds of men), and man says, 'What is (the matter) with it?' - That Day, it will report its news. Because your Lord has commanded it." (Quran 99:1-5)

Additionally, in Surah Al-Infitar (Chapter 82), it describes how every soul will realize their account of deeds:

> "O mankind, what has deceived you concerning your Lord, the Generous, Who created you and fashioned you and assembled you?" (Quran 82:6-8)

In evaluating the biblical perspective, I encourage you to refer to experts in Christian theology or biblical studies for a comprehensive understanding. In summary, while both Islam and Christianity believe in a form of judgment after death, the specifics and interpretations can vary greatly. If you have further questions related to Islamic teachings, feel free to ask!

**Grade: 80/100**

**Comment:**

The student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical perspective on judgment, referencing relevant scriptures and explaining the consequences of actions and faith. However, the response is primarily based on Islamic teachings rather than Christian theology. While the similarities between Islamic and Christian beliefs are noteworthy, the student could have provided more direct references to Christian sources to support their claims. Additionally, the response could have elaborated more on the specific criteria used in Christian theology for judgment.
