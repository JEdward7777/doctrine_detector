  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the eschatological themes associated with the 'Day of Yahweh' or 'Day of the Lord' in both Judeo-Christian and Islamic contexts. They correctly highlighted key elements such as divine judgment, cosmic disturbances, restoration, the coming of the Messiah, establishment of justice and peace, resurrection, judgment, signs of the Hour, and the concept of heaven and hell. However, the student's response was more focused on general similarities between the two traditions rather than specifically addressing the concern of clarifying the events that will take place during this significant time in Christian eschatology. The student could have strengthened their answer by directly referencing the judgment of sinners, resurrection, and the permanent establishment of the Lord's rule as highlighted in the reference answer."
