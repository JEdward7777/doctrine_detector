## [Answer](../Judgment_of_Others.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic teachings, the attitude towards judging or pointing out the faults of others is rooted in the principles of self-awareness, humility, and compassion. While Jesus is a revered figure in Islam (known as 'Isa), his teachings align with many Islamic values regarding how we should interact with others.

One key concept is found in the teachings of both Jesus and the Quran: before criticizing others, one must first reflect on their own shortcomings. In the Bible, Jesus famously states, “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?” (Matthew 7:3). This encourages individuals to evaluate their own faults before pointing out the faults of others, emphasizing the importance of personal accountability and self-examination.

In Islam, this principle is also echoed significantly. The Quran advises believers to be mindful of their own actions and behavior. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:44) states, "Will you enjoin people to righteousness while you ignore your own selves?" This verse highlights the expectation that a Muslim should first ensure their own conduct is righteous before advising others.

Additionally, the concept of **Nasiha** (sincere advice) in Islam encourages believers to advise one another in a manner that is constructive and compassionate. It emphasizes that any criticism should come from a place of love and concern, rather than judgement or arrogance.

Ultimately, both Jesus's teachings and Islamic principles encourage a humble approach to addressing the faults of others, advocating for self-reflection and sincere intentions in personal interactions. This fosters a community that supports each other in growth and betterment while being aware of their own limitations.
