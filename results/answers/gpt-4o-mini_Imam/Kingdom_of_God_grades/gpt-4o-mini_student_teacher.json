  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer shows a thoughtful consideration of cultural adaptation in translations, which is commendable. However, the concern given specifically highlights the risk of losing the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' through rephrasing. The suggested alternatives, while respectful of cultural differences, may not fully address this concern. The reference answer emphasizes the importance of retaining the original term along with providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance, which the student's response does not sufficiently align with."
