The suggested alternatives are respectful and relevant. However, the concern that rephrasing could potentially lose the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' is valid. While providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance is crucial, retaining the term itself can preserve the richness and theological depth associated with it. Overall, this response offers a balanced perspective on translation considerations within a Christian worldview."
