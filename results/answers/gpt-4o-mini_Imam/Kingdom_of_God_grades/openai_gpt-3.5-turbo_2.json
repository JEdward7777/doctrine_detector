  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the original response emphasizes the importance of retaining the term \"Kingdom of God\" and providing explanations for its spiritual and eschatological significance, the rephrasing suggested in the graded response could potentially lead to a loss of the depth and biblical context associated with the term. It is vital to consider maintaining the theological integrity and richness of the term while making it accessible to different cultural contexts. Further clarification or examples demonstrating how to preserve the depth and biblical context within alternative translations would strengthen the response."
