The suggested approach of retaining the original term and explaining its significance is in line with preserving the term's theological richness, but lacks consideration for cultural nuances that may impact understanding. Further discussion on how to strike a balance between maintaining the term's depth and ensuring cultural relevance would enhance the response."
