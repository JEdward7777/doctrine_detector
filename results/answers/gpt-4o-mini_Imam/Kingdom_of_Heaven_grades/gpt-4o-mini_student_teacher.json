  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student offers a comprehensive analysis of the term \"kingdom of heaven\" in the book of Matthew from an interfaith perspective, particularly comparing Christian and Islamic beliefs. However, the response might have deviated slightly from the specific concern about the unique terminology in the gospels. While the student's insights are valuable, a more focused examination of the term's significance within Matthew's gospel would have strengthened the connection to the concern provided."
