## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The vast majority of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, was written in Hebrew. Some portions, particularly in the books of Daniel and Ezra, were written in Aramaic, which was a widely spoken language in the Near East during certain periods. However, Hebrew is the primary language of the Old Testament text.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The student has correctly identified that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which aligns with the given answer. They also provide additional information about specific books being written in Aramaic, which shows an attempt to provide context and nuance to their statement.

However, I deduct points because the response does not directly address the concern about understanding the original context of the Scriptures. While the student mentions that Hebrew is the primary language of the Old Testament text, they do not explicitly state how this knowledge is essential for studying the Scriptures or understanding their original context.

A perfect score would require a more explicit connection between the linguistic information and its relevance to biblical studies. Nevertheless, the student's response still demonstrates a good understanding of the languages used in the Old Testament, and with some refinement, they could provide an even stronger answer that directly addresses the concern.
