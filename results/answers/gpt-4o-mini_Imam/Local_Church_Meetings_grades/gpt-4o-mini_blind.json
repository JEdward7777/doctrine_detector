However, the question specifically asked about believers in a particular city according to the church context, not a Muslim context. To align more closely with the question, the response needed to focus on how Christians typically meet in a church setting rather than drawing parallels with Muslim congregational practices. The answer could have included details about Sunday worship services, midweek prayer meetings, Bible studies, fellowship groups, and other church-related gatherings."
