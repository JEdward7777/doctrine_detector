  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and informative about how believers in a Muslim context typically gather. However, the student did not address the specific concern of fostering local fellowship among believers. The focus on Islamic practices and gatherings, while informative, did not directly relate to the question about believers meeting in someone's home to pray and discuss scripture. The student's answer would have been improved by connecting the Muslim context to the importance of fostering local fellowship among believers, drawing parallels or differences with the Christian practice of meeting in homes for prayer and scripture discussion."
