While the answer focuses on Islamic contexts, it highlights similarities with Christian gatherings, such as prayer and scripture discussions in private homes. However, it would benefit from more direct engagement with the provided reference answer, which specifies the common practice of believers meeting in someone's home in the particular city. Including such a connection would strengthen the overall response from a Christian perspective."
