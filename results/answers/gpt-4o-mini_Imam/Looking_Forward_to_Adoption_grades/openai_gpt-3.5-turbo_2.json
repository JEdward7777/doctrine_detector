The response should have focused more on the unique Christian concept of believers' adoption as God's children through Christ and the anticipation for the fulfillment of this relationship in the future. More emphasis on the centrality of Christ and the crucial role of faith in this adoption process would have been beneficial for a more thorough Christian perspective."
