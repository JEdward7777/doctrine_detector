It acknowledges the importance of waiting, striving, and hoping for a higher purpose in both faiths. However, the response does not fully address the specific concern of understanding the hope and future aspect of being adopted into God's family as outlined in the given answer. It focuses more on the general themes of spiritual longing and divine relationship rather than delving into the nuances of adoption and future glorification within a Christian worldview."
