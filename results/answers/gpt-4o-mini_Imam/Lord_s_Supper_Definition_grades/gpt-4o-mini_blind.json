However, the inclusion of information regarding the Islamic perspective, while respectful, is not directly relevant to the question at hand, which asks specifically about the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian belief. The response could have been improved by elaborating further on the theological implications and spiritual significance of the event within Christian doctrine."
