## [Answer](../Lord_s_Supper_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The Lord's Supper, known as the Eucharist or Communion in Christian traditions, commemorates the Last Supper that Jesus Christ shared with his disciples before his crucifixion. This event is significant in Christianity as it represents the establishment of the New Covenant between God and humanity, symbolized by the bread and wine, which represent the body and blood of Christ. 

While this event is primarily a Christian belief, in the context of Islam, we recognize and respect the importance of Jesus (Isa) as a prophet and messenger of God. However, our understanding of the events surrounding Jesus' life, including the Last Supper, differs significantly from Christian narratives. In Islam, we honor Jesus as a servant of God and a significant figure but do not attribute the same theological meanings to these events as Christians do.
