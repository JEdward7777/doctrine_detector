However, it loses some points for not delving deeper into the theological implications of the Lord's Supper within the Christian belief system, such as the establishment of the New Covenant between God and humanity through Jesus Christ. The comparison with Islam's perspective on Jesus is relevant but could be further expanded upon to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the differences in beliefs."
