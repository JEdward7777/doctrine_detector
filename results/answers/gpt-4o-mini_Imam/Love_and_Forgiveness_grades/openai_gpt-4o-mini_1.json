The parallels drawn between the two religions enhance the understanding of forgiveness as a universal principle. The emphasis on forgiveness in daily interactions as a reflection of God's love is clear and well-supported within both Christian and Islamic teachings. Moreover, the response effectively conveys how forgiveness nurtures healthy relationships and contributes to personal spiritual growth."
