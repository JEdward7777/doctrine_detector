  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response from a Christian perspective regarding the significance of the 'bond of marriage.' The answer effectively highlighted key principles such as the sacred nature of marriage as a covenant, reflecting the relationship between Christ and the Church. The emphasis on commitment, love, sacrifice, and virtues essential for a healthy marriage was well-addressed. However, the response could have further emphasized the aspect of the divine establishment of marriage by God and the importance of mutual support and love between spouses as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of Christian beliefs regarding marriage."
