The discussion on the reflection of the relationship between Christ and the Church, the virtues to be practiced within marriage, and the emphasis on marriage as a means of serving God together all align well with promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships. The response effectively integrates Christian teachings and values into the discussion of the importance of the marriage bond."
