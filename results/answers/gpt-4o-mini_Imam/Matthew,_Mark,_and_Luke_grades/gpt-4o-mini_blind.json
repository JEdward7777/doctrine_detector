The student correctly identifies the main passages in the New Testament where the names of the twelve disciples are listed and includes additional context for each passage. The answer could be further enhanced by mentioning that the twelfth disciple is sometimes referred to as Matthias in Acts 1:26. Overall, a well-done and doctrinally sound explanation."
