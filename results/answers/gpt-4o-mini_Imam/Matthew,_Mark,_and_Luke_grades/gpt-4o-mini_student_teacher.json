  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a very detailed and accurate answer, listing the specific passages where the names of the twelve disciples are found in the Bible. The inclusion of additional context and details from each passage demonstrates a strong understanding and knowledge of the subject matter. However, the answer could have been improved by directly stating that the names of the twelve disciples are listed in Matthew, Mark, and Luke as requested in the question."
