  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies the general location of the disciples' names in the Bible (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), but it lacks specific detail and doesn't demonstrate thorough understanding of the Gospel accounts. A higher grade would require more precision and attention to the details provided in each passage.\n\nAs the concern is about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, this response demonstrates some familiarity but could be improved by providing a more nuanced understanding of the passages themselves."
