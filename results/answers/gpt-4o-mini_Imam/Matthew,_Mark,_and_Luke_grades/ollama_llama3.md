## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The names of the twelve disciples of Jesus, known as the twelve apostles, are listed in several books of the New Testament in the Bible. The main passages where their names can be found are:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage provides a list of the apostles along with some additional details.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - Similar to Matthew, this passage lists the apostles and includes some context.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - This passage also contains the names of the apostles and the moment they were chosen.
4. **Acts 1:13** - In this passage, after the Ascension of Jesus, the apostles' names are listed as well.

Each of these passages provides slightly different details but ultimately lists the same twelve individuals.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The response correctly identifies the general location of the disciples' names in the Bible (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), but it lacks specific detail and doesn't demonstrate thorough understanding of the Gospel accounts. A higher grade would require more precision and attention to the details provided in each passage.

As the concern is about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, this response demonstrates some familiarity but could be improved by providing a more nuanced understanding of the passages themselves.
