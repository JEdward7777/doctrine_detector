The student clearly articulates the distinct meanings of the term 'Messiah' within each tradition and highlights the variations in their beliefs. The inclusion of Islamic perspectives adds depth to the analysis. The response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer by explaining Jesus as the Messiah who fulfills Old Testament prophecies and emphasizes his unique role as savior."
