## [Answer](../Messiah.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The term 'Messiah' carries distinct meanings across different religious traditions, particularly within Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, reflecting their unique theological contexts and expectations of a savior figure.

1. **Judaism**: In Jewish belief, the Messiah (or "Moshiach") is an expected future leader from the Davidic line who will bring about the redemption of the Jewish people, restore the Jewish kingdom, and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. This figure is not divine but a human leader who will fulfill specific prophetic criteria, including bringing peace, ensuring the ingathering of exiles, and establishing a period of universal justice and knowledge of God. The Jewish expectations do not involve a concept of atonement for sins but rather a restoration of rightful order in the world.

2. **Christianity**: For Christians, the term 'Messiah' is closely associated with Jesus Christ, viewed as the divine Savior and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. Christians believe that Jesus, through his life, death, and resurrection, provided salvation from sin for humanity. This belief emphasizes a spiritual redemption rather than just political or social restoration. Jesusâ€™ death is interpreted as an atoning sacrifice, and his resurrection is seen as a victory over death, offering believers eternal life.

3. **Islam**: In Islam, Jesus (known as Isa) is regarded as the Messiah (al-Masih) but with a distinct role. Muslims believe he was a prophet and messenger of God, born of the Virgin Mary (Maryam) and performing miracles. However, they do not view him as the son of God or as divine. In Islamic eschatology, Jesus is expected to return before the Day of Judgment to restore justice and defeat the false messiah (the Dajjal). The role of the Messiah in Islam aligns more with the idea of restoring faith and justice rather than with the theological implications of atonement and divine sonship found in Christianity.

Each of these religious traditions incorporates their understanding of the Messiah within a broader narrative of salvation, purpose, and fulfillment of God's promise to humanity, though the figures and their roles differ significantly. As a Muslim, one would recognize Jesus as the Messiah who will return and usher in a time of justice, aligned with Islamic teachings while appreciating the variations in belief and expectation among different faiths.
