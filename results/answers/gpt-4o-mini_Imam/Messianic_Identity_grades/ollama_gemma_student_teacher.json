The answer provides a well-reasoned and articulate analysis of the theological, historical, and eschatological implications of the title from both Christian and Islamic perspectives. The student clearly articulates the differing interpretations of the title between the two religions, while acknowledging the shared belief in Jesus as the Messiah."
