The student effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' role as the promised Messiah, descended from King David, highlighting the central importance of Jesus' messianic role in the Christian faith. The inclusion of various lenses through which the title can be understood, such as prophetic fulfillment, political context, divine kingship, and eschatological significance, demonstrates a holistic approach to the topic. Overall, a well-written and comprehensive response."
