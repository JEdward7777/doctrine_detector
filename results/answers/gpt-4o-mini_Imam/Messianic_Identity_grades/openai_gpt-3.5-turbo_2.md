## [Answer](../Messianic_Identity.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The title 'King of the Jews' holds significant theological and historical implications regarding the identity of Jesus (known as Isa in Islam). In the Christian context, this title is often associated with Jesus' role as the awaited Messiah, the anointed one who was prophesied in the Hebrew Scriptures.

For Muslims, Jesus is also considered a revered prophet and the Messiah, but our understanding diverges from the Christian perspective. In Islam, Jesus is not seen as the Son of God or divine, but as a prophet who was sent to guide the Children of Israel with a specific message.

The title 'King of the Jews' can be understood through several lenses:

1. **Prophetic Fulfillment**: In the Hebrew Bible, there are numerous prophecies regarding the coming of a Messiah. This Messiah is expected to restore Israel and establish an era of peace. Christians believe Jesus fulfilled these prophecies, while Muslims believe that while he was a significant prophet, the ultimate fulfillment is yet to come with the return of Jesus.

2. **Political Context**: During the time of Jesus, Jewish expectations of a Messiah were often politically motivated. Many Jews anticipated a leader who would liberate them from Roman oppression and re-establish a Davidic kingdom. The title 'King of the Jews' may reflect this expectation but can also be seen in the context of its eventual appropriation by Roman authorities, particularly when used during Jesus' crucifixion.

3. **Divine Kingship**: In a more theological sense, Jesus' title can be interpreted as a recognition of his divine authority and role within the broader scope of God's plan for humanity. While Muslims do not see Jesus as a divine figure, we acknowledge his significant position as a prophet who performed miracles and spread God's message.

4. **Eschatological Significance**: In Islamic eschatology, Jesus is expected to return as a sign of the end times, where he will restore justice and defeat falsehood. Thus, in this sense, the title can also foreshadow his future role in the cosmic battle between good and evil.

In summary, the title 'King of the Jews' encapsulates various interpretations tied to messianic expectations, political realities of the time, and theological implications of Jesus' identity as a central figure in both Christianity and Islam. For Muslims, while we honor Jesus as a prophet and the Messiah, we emphasize submission to God's will and await the coming of the true leader who will establish peace and justice according to divine decree.
