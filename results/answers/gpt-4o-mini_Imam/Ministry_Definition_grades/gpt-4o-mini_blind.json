  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student correctly identifies the concept of \"ministering\" as serving and caring for those in need, there are significant theological differences between Christian ministering and Islamic principles of service. The student did not specifically address the Christian understanding of ministering as rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ and the New Testament. Additionally, there is a lack of emphasis on the unique Christian beliefs regarding redemption, sin, and salvation that shape the Christian approach to ministering. The response could benefit from a clearer distinction between Christian and Islamic perspectives on serving others."
