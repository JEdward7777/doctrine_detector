  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed explanation and draws parallels between ministering in a Muslim context and the principles in Islam, they did not specifically address the biblical definition of ministry according to the Bible. The biblical view of ministry emphasizes teaching about God and caring for spiritual needs, which was not explicitly mentioned in the student's response. The student's answer is insightful but lacks a clear focus on the biblical perspective of ministry."
