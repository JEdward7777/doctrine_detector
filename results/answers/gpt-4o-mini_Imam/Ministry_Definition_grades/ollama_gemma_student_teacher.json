This approach demonstrates a commendable effort to bridge the gap between different faiths and highlight shared values.\n\nThe student's response clearly explains the essence of ministering as serving, supporting, and caring for others, emphasizing compassion, kindness, and social justice. The inclusion of relevant Quranic verses and hadiths strengthens their argument and provides textual evidence to support their claims.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific ways one can \"minister\" to others in a Christian context, beyond the general principles shared across faiths."
