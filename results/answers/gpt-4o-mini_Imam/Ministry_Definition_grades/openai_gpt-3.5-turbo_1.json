  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of how the concept of ministering can be understood in a Muslim context, highlighting the shared values of serving and caring for others. However, the focus is more on general principles of helping others rather than specifically addressing the biblical definition of ministry. While the explanation provided is insightful, it does not directly address the concern about understanding the biblical definition of ministry for effective service in the church and community. Therefore, the response could be more focused and aligned with the specific concern provided."
