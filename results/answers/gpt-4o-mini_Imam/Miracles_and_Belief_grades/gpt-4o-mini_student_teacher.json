  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 75.\n\nWhile the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the role of miracles in Islam and how they can lead to belief in God, there are a few areas that could be improved. The answer provided offers a thorough explanation of the different functions of miracles in Islam and how they can impact belief in God. However, the student could have directly linked their explanation to the concern provided, specifically in terms of how understanding the role of miracles can enhance evangelism and personal faith. Additionally, the answer could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern raised.\n\nOverall, the student has shown a good grasp of the topic but could benefit from more direct alignment with the concern given and a more targeted approach to answering the question."
