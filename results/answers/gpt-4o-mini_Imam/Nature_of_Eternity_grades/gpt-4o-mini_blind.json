  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a good overview of how eternity is defined in the context of Christian beliefs, highlighting key theological aspects such as the transcendence of time, the existence of God beyond temporal constraints, and the eternal nature of heaven and hell. The response also acknowledges variations in interpretations among Christian denominations. However, to improve the grade, the student could delve deeper into the biblical basis for these beliefs and provide more specific references to relevant scriptures to strengthen the doctrinal foundation of their explanation. Overall, a solid response with room for further theological development."
