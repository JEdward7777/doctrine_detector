  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a well-explained and thoughtful answer regarding the concept of eternity in Christian beliefs. They correctly address the timeless and unchanging nature of eternity, as well as its connection to heaven and hell. There is a good exploration of different denominational perspectives on eternity. However, the student missed emphasizing the crucial aspect of eternity as a state with no beginning or end, which is essential in understanding the Christian concept of eternity. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic but lacking a clear definition as provided in the reference answer."
