  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament. The student effectively incorporates key biblical references and principles, emphasizing the importance of love, encouragement, gentleness, sound doctrine, community building, prayerful approach, and self-reflection. The only area for potential improvement would be to include more direct references to the teachings of Jesus Christ on exhortation, as His words serve as the foundation for Christian conduct. Overall, an excellent and doctrinally sound answer."
