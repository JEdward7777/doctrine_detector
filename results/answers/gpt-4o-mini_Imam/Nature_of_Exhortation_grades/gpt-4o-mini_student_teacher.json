  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that aligns well with the teachings of the New Testament on exhortation. They have highlighted key aspects such as love, encouragement, gentleness, and sound doctrine. While they have covered various important points, the reference answer emphasizes the idea of exhorting in love without being harsh or abrupt more concisely. The student's answer could have been more focused on this specific aspect to align more closely with the reference answer."
