The incorporation of relevant New Testament teachings, such as love and compassion, gentle restoration, the importance of sound doctrine, community building, prayerful approach, and self-reflection, effectively addresses the concern. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on exhortation and provides practical guidance for Christians to follow in this aspect of their faith journey."
