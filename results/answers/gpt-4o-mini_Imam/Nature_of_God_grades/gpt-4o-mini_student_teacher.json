  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful answer that demonstrates an understanding of the concept of God as a spirit and its implications for worship. However, the student's response focused more on Islamic teachings and interpretations rather than Christian perspectives, which was the specified worldview for grading. Additionally, the answer could have been more concise and directly related to the concern of understanding God's essence and connecting in worship."
