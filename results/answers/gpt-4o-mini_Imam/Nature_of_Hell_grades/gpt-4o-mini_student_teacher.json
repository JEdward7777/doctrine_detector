  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a decent overview of how hell is described in the Bible, referencing relevant passages and key themes such as eternal punishment, fire and torment, separation from God, and judgment. However, the response lacked depth in discussing the severity and purpose of hell in relation to the Christian view of judgment and salvation. The student should have focused more on the implications of hell in understanding the consequences of sin and the need for salvation through Jesus Christ."
