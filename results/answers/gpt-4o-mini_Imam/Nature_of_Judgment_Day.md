## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In a Christian context, "Judgment Day" refers to a future time when God will judge all humanity based on their faith and actions during their lives. This concept is detailed in various parts of the Bible, particularly in the New Testament.

Key aspects include:

1. **The Final Judgment**: This is often associated with the second coming of Jesus Christ. For example, in the Gospel of Matthew (25:31-46), Jesus describes the separation of the righteous from the unrighteous, likening it to a shepherd separating sheep from goats.

2. **Resurrection of the Dead**: According to Christian belief, there will be a resurrection of the dead. In Revelation 20:11-15, it describes a great white throne judgment where the dead are judged according to their deeds, as recorded in the "books." Those whose names are found in the "Book of Life" are granted eternal life, while others face judgment.

3. **Eternal Consequences**: The outcome of this judgment determines the eternal fate of individuals—eternal life in Heaven or eternal separation from God, often referred to as Hell.

4. **Faith and Works**: Christian theology often emphasizes that both faith in Jesus Christ and one's actions play a crucial role in this judgment. Ephesians 2:8-9 underscores that salvation is a gift from God through faith, and James 2:26 emphasizes that faith without works is dead.

In summary, Judgment Day in the Christian context is a pivotal event that involves God’s final judgment of all people, determining their eternal destiny based on their faith in Jesus Christ and their deeds.
