## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Bible, manna is described primarily in the Book of Exodus. It is referred to as "bread from heaven." The appearance of manna is described as being similar to coriander seed, and its color is described as white (Exodus 16:31). As for its taste, manna is said to taste like wafers made with honey (Exodus 16:31 again). Additionally, Numbers 11:7-8 provides more detail, stating that it was like the appearance of bdellium and that it could be ground into flour or cooked in pots, resulting in various forms of food that the Israelites could prepare.

Manna served as a miraculous sustenance provided by Allah (God) to the Israelites during their 40 years in the desert, symbolizing divine provision and care.
