  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical descriptions of manna's appearance and taste. It accurately cites relevant scriptures (Exodus 16:31 and Numbers 11:7-8) to support their claims. Additionally, the student thoughtfully highlights the miraculous nature of manna as a symbol of divine provision and care. However, the reference to Allah (God) in the final sentence is not consistent with the Christian worldview and may be considered inappropriate for the grading criteria."
