However, there is a concern with the mention of Allah (God) providing manna to the Israelites. From a Christian worldview, it is important to clarify that the God who provided manna to the Israelites in the Bible is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as revealed in the Old Testament and further manifested in the New Testament through Jesus Christ."
