However, the response falls short in addressing the concern of understanding the miraculous provision of God fully. It mentions Allah (God) instead of the Christian God, which is the perspective to be considered here. Further elaboration on how manna symbolizes divine provision and care in the Christian worldview would strengthen the response."
