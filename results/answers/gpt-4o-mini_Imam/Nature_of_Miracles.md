## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic tradition, Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) is revered as a prophet and messenger of God, but not as the Son of God or divine himself. The miracles attributed to Jesus in the Quran and Islamic teachings serve to highlight his special status as a prophet and the power of God working through him.

1. **Affirmation of Prophethood**: The miracles demonstrate that Jesus was sent by God with a divine mission. His ability to perform signs such as healing the sick, giving sight to the blind, and raising the dead affirms his role as a messenger and a prophet chosen by God.

2. **Signs of God's Power**: Each miracle serves as a sign (ayah) of God's omnipotence and mercy. They reflect God's ability to intervene in the natural order, and they underscore the concept of tawheed (the oneness of God) by showing that all power to heal and create ultimately belongs to Him.

3. **Compassion and Mercy**: The acts of healing and aiding the needy illustrate Jesus' compassion and mercy, qualities that are iconic in Islamic teachings. This aligns with the Islamic view that all prophets embody attributes of kindness and guidance, directing humanity toward worship of one God.

4. **Challenges to His Community**: The miracles also served as challenges to the beliefs and practices of his contemporaries, calling them to recognize God's truth and the need for repentance. They were both a message of hope and a reminder of accountability.

5. **Preparations for His Teachings**: The miracles acted as a precursor to the teachings Jesus imparted, reinforcing his messages about faith, righteousness, and the coming Day of Judgment.

In Islam, while Jesus is highly regarded and his miracles are acknowledged, it is essential to remember that these acts are seen as manifestations of God's will and power rather than an indication of Jesus' own divine nature. His identity is firmly rooted in the acknowledgement of Godâ€™s singularity and the prophetic calling that he fulfilled.
