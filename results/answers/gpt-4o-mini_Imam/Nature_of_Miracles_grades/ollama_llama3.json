  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response does not align with the concern of understanding Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature. Instead, it presents an entirely different perspective on Jesus's miracles, stating that they reveal He is God and the Christ. This contradicts the Islamic view presented in the original text, which sees Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, but not as God or the Son of God. The response does not engage with the concern or provide insight into the Islamic understanding of Jesus's miracles, earning it a low grade."
