The answer given in the response contradicts the Christian view that Jesus's miracles demonstrate His divinity as the Son of God and the Messiah. In Christianity, the miracles of Jesus serve as evidence of His deity and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the coming Savior. Therefore, the response falls short in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview."
