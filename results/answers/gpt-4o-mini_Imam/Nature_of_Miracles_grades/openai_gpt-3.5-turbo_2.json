  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed explanation of how Islamic tradition views Jesus and his miracles as affirmations of his prophethood and the power of God working through him. However, the response did not directly address the concern about understanding the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature from a Christian perspective. The response instead emphasized that in Islam, Jesus is not considered divine but rather a prophet. To receive a higher grade, the response should have more directly engaged with the specific concern presented in a Christian worldview."
