  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and detailed explanation of the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word within a biblical context, addressing the concern effectively. It accurately distinguishes between scripture as the written collection of divine revelation and the broader concept of the word of God encompassing God's messages and communication, including those delivered by Jesus. The integration of scriptural references and the explanation of Jesus as the Word in the Gospel of John further strengthen the response. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the idea that the Word of God includes both written and spoken revelations from God."
