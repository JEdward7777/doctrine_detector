## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islam, the concept of temptation is closely linked to human nature and the external influences that can affect one's moral choices. Understanding these influences helps Muslims navigate their faith and strive for righteousness. Here are the roles of sinful nature and external influences in temptation:

1. **Sinful Nature (Nafs)**: In Islamic theology, the "nafs" refers to the self or soul, which can inclinate towards good or evil. There is a notion that human beings have a predisposition to sin (known as "fitrah" in its original, pure state, but affected by societal and personal experiences). The nafs can be influenced by desires and instincts that lead to sinful behavior. The Quran mentions this aspect in Surah Yusuf (12:53), where it is stated that the soul commands to evil unless one is shown mercy by Allah.

2. **External Influences**: External factors such as societal norms, peer pressure, and temptations presented by Shaitan (Satan) are significant influences on a person's ability to resist temptation. Shaitan is described in the Quran as a clear enemy to humanity, actively trying to lead people astray (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:168). Additionally, the surroundings in which one lives—including friends, family, and broader societal attitudes—can impact one’s moral choices.

3. **Environmental Factors**: The environment can shape behavior significantly. The company one keeps and the media one consumes can either fortify one's faith or lead one towards temptation. Therefore, choosing good companions and engaging in positive, faith-affirming activities are encouraged in Islam.

4. **Accountability and Free Will**: In Islam, humans are given free will to choose their actions. This means that while there are impulses toward sin and external temptations, individuals are still responsible for their choices. Allah's guidance through the Qur'an and Sunnah equips Muslims with the knowledge and tools to resist these temptations.

5. **Seeking Forgiveness and Strength**: Muslims believe that despite the influence of their sinful nature and external factors, they can seek forgiveness from Allah and ask for strength through prayer (dua) and sincere repentance (tawbah). This relationship with Allah helps fortify their resolve against temptation.

6. **The Role of Faith and Good Deeds**: Engaging in good deeds and strengthening one's faith through acts of worship is crucial in resisting temptation. The more one engages with their faith, the more they cultivate a strong character that resists succumbing to sinful inclinations.

In summary, both sinful nature and external influences play significant roles in the experience of temptation. However, Islam teaches that with faith, self-awareness, and divine support, individuals can overcome these challenges and strive towards righteousness.
