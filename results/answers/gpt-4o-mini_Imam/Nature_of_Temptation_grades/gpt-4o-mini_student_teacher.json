  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the roles of sinful nature and external influences in temptation from an Islamic perspective, which is not aligned with the Christian worldview. The answer lacks a clear connection to Christian teaching, focusing solely on Islamic beliefs. Additionally, it deviates from the reference answer provided by the teacher, which succinctly summarizes the Christian perspective on temptation. A grade of 30 is given for the effort put into the response but the lack of alignment with the Christian specific worldview."
