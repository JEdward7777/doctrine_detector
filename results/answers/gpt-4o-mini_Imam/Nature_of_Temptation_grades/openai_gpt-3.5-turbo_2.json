It effectively addresses the concern raised by comparing and contrasting the Islamic perspective with the Christian understanding of temptation. The Christian worldview emphasizes the inherent sinful nature of humanity due to the fall of Adam and Eve, which aligns with the concept of \"fitrah\" in Islam. Additionally, the mention of Satan as an external influence echoes the Christian belief in the adversary tempting individuals towards sin. The response could be strengthened by directly referencing Christian scriptures or teachings on temptation for more explicit comparison."
