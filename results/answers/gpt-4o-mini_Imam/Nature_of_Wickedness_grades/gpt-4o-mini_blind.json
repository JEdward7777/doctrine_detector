  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general overview of the concept of wickedness in the Bible, with basic references and explanations. However, the answer lacks depth and detail in its exploration of the biblical perspective on wickedness. The student could have delved deeper into specific narratives or examples from the Bible to support their points. Additionally, the response could have incorporated more theological insights and doctrinal perspectives to enhance its accuracy and thoroughness according to a Christian worldview."
