  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-structured and informative response to the question, incorporating key biblical principles on wickedness and its implications for individuals. They successfully highlighted various ways in which individuals can be considered wicked according to biblical perspectives and discussed the consequences for such individuals. However, the student's answer did not succinctly capture the essence of the reference answer provided by the teacher, as it included additional information and a comparative view with Islam. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on directly addressing the specific concern raised and aligning their response closely with the reference answer."
