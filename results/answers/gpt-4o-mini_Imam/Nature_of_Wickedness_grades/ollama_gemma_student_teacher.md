As an Imam, my expertise primarily lies in Islamic teachings, but I can provide a brief overview of what generally is understood about the concept of wickedness in a biblical context, while keeping in mind our mutual values and beliefs.

In the Bible, the term "wicked" often refers to actions or behaviors that are morally wrong or contrary to God's commandments. There are several ways in which individuals can be described as wicked based on biblical texts:

1. **Disobedience to God's Law**: Throughout the Old Testament, individuals who violate God's laws and commandments are referred to as wicked. The Ten Commandments, for instance, outline behaviors that, when contravened, exemplify wickedness (Exodus 20).

2. **Moral Corruption**: The Bible discusses various forms of moral corruption, such as lying, stealing, committing adultery, and engaging in unjust behaviors (Proverbs 6:16-19 highlights things that the Lord hates).

3. **Oppression and Injustice**: Many biblical texts condemn those who oppress the poor, unjustly punish the innocent, or exploit others (Isaiah 10:1-2 speaks against those who make unjust laws).

4. **Idolatry**: In monotheistic terms, turning away from the worship of God and towards idols or false gods is often viewed as wickedness. This is a recurring theme in both the Old and New Testaments (Deuteronomy 27:15).

**State of Wicked Individuals**: 

The Bible suggests several consequences for those deemed wicked:

- **Separation from God**: It is often emphasized that wickedness leads to spiritual separation from God. Isaiah 59:2 states, "But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you..." 

- **Judgment and Punishment**: The Bible speaks of eventual judgment for the wicked, both in this life and in the hereafter (e.g., Psalm 37:9 describes the fate of the wicked).

- **Call to Repentance**: Importantly, there are also calls for the wicked to repent and turn back to righteousness (Ezekiel 18:30), reflecting the belief in God's mercy and the opportunity for salvation.

In summary, while the concept of wickedness is addressed in various ways in the Bible, the core themes often revolve around disobedience to God, moral failures, and the impact of such actions on one's relationship with the Divine. In a shared understanding, both Islam and Christianity underscore the importance of righteousness and the potential for redemption through repentance.
