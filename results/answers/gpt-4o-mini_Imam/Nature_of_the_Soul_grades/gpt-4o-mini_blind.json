  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' from a Biblical perspective, drawing from Hebrew and Greek terms. The distinctions between the two are explained well, emphasizing the immaterial aspect of the spirit and the more holistic nature of the soul. The connection to Christian theology and implications for human identity and relationship with God are appropriately highlighted. One area for improvement could be to delve deeper into the Biblical texts that support these distinctions and provide clearer references for further study. Overall, a well-reasoned and informative response."
