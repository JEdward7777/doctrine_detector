  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible and their distinctions, they failed to address the concern adequately. Although they highlighted the implications for discussions about human identity, life after death, and personal relationship with God in Christian theology, the lack of recognition that the terms can be presented as interchangeable in the Bible contradicts the teacher's reference answer. Understanding this nuance is crucial in accurately interpreting scripture related to human nature and relationship with God from a Christian perspective. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concepts themselves and their significance in biblical interpretation."
