  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. They accurately identified and explained the restrictions regarding abstaining from wine and grape products, avoiding haircuts, and avoiding ritual impurity. Their understanding of the significance of these restrictions in relation to personal holiness, commitment to God, and spiritual discipline is commendable. However, the student could have been more concise in their response to align it closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
