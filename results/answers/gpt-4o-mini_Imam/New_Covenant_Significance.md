## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) is a revered prophet and messenger of God, but the concept of a "new covenant" as understood in Christian theology does not hold the same significance in Islam. 

Muslims believe that Jesus was sent to guide the Children of Israel and that he brought important teachings and miracles. However, Islam teaches that the final and universal message of God was completed with the Prophet Muhammad, who is considered the last prophet. This message, encapsulated in the Quran, is seen as the restoration of the true monotheistic faith and guidance for all of humanity, superseding previous revelations, including those associated with the life of Jesus.

In the Christian context, the new covenant often refers to the relationship established through Jesus' death and resurrection, which offers believers salvation and a renewed relationship with God. In contrast, Islam encourages believers to follow the guidance of the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad, which provide a comprehensive framework for worship and moral conduct.

While Jesus is deeply respected in Islam, the understanding of covenants and the nature of Jesusâ€™ role is framed within the broader narrative of Islam's belief in the oneness of God (Tawhid) and the continuity of prophetic messages culminating in Muhammad.
