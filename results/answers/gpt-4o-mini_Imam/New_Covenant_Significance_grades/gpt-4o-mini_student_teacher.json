  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on Jesus and the concept of covenants, the answer does not fully address the significance of the new covenant established through Jesus in the Christian faith. The student should have emphasized more on the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice as central to the establishment of the new covenant, rather than solely focusing on the differences between Islam and Christianity."
