  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian perspective on the new covenant and its significance based on Jesus' sacrifice. However, the answer also acknowledges the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the finality of Muhammad as the last prophet. The student's ability to present both viewpoints respectfully and thoughtfully earns a high grade."
