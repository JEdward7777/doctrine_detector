  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the concept of covenants, but it falls short of addressing the concern about the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises. It does not engage with the Christian understanding of the new covenant being based on Jesus' sacrificial atonement for sins and the fulfillment of God's promises. Therefore, the response lacks depth in addressing the specific concern provided."
