  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on Jesus and the concept of the new covenant. However, it lacks a direct engagement with the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises as specified in the concern. To improve the grade, the response could have included a more in-depth analysis of how Jesus' sacrifice fulfills God's promises and brings about transformation for believers within the Christian worldview."
