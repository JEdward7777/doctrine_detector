Here are a few key points regarding the relationship between Christians and the Psalms:

2. **Worship**: In Colossians 3:16, Christians are encouraged to use Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs in their gatherings, indicating that the Psalms serve as a model for worship and meditation.

3. **Encouragement and Instruction**: The Psalms are often used in the New Testament to provide encouragement, spiritual reflection, and instruction for life, illustrating the continuity of God's message throughout the Scriptures.
