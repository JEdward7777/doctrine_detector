  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of the significance of the Psalms in the New Testament and their relevance to Christian worship and teaching. However, the student's answer did not directly address the specific instruction given in the New Testament regarding singing Psalms to God as a way of worshiping Him. While the student correctly highlighted various ways the Psalms are utilized and acknowledged in the New Testament, the lack of explicit mention of the specific instruction regarding singing Psalms as a form of worship slightly detracts from the complete fulfillment of the given concern."
