It effectively addresses the concern by detailing how the Psalms are utilized in worship, teaching, and reflection in contemporary Christian practice. The inclusion of specific examples from the New Testament and the acknowledgment of the Psalms' role in the life of believers enhances the clarity and depth of the response."
