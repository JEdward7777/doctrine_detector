While the New Testament does not provide explicit "instructions" to Christians about the Psalms, it recognizes their importance. Here are a few key points regarding the relationship between Christians and the Psalms:

1. **Quotation of Psalms**: The New Testament frequently quotes the Psalms to highlight the fulfillment of prophecies concerning Jesus Christ, His life, and His mission. For instance, Psalm 22 is quoted to illustrate the suffering of Jesus during His crucifixion.

2. **Worship**: In Colossians 3:16, Christians are encouraged to use Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs in their gatherings, indicating that the Psalms serve as a model for worship and meditation.

3. **Encouragement and Instruction**: The Psalms are often used in the New Testament to provide encouragement, spiritual reflection, and instruction for life, illustrating the continuity of God's message throughout the Scriptures.

4. **Jesusâ€™ Use of the Psalms**: Jesus Himself referenced the Psalms in His teachings, affirming their relevance and authority. He taught from the Psalms during His ministry, indicating their profound impact on faith and practice.

In summary, while the New Testament does not give direct instructions about the Psalms, it acknowledges their significance in Christian worship, teaching, and reflection, affirming their role in the life of believers.
