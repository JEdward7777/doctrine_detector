## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Christian theology, the concept of every believer being considered a priest is rooted in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of the Apostle Peter and the Book of Revelation. This idea emphasizes the "priesthood of all believers," which holds that all followers of Jesus have direct access to God and can offer spiritual sacrifices, rather than being dependent on a special priestly class.

1. **1 Peter 2:9** states, "But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession…" This verse highlights that believers are not just followers but are given a special status as priests who serve God and have a significant role in His divine plan.

2. **Revelation 1:6** and **5:10** affirm that believers have been made to be "a kingdom and priests to serve our God." This emphasizes the idea of spiritual authority and responsibility among all Christians, not just church leaders.

3. **Sacrificial Role**: In the Old Covenant, priests performed rituals and sacrifices on behalf of the people. In the New Covenant, however, believers are called to offer their lives and actions as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1) and to engage in worship and service directly to God.

4. **A Relationship with God**: Each believer has a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ, which allows them to approach Him directly in prayer and worship, something the high priest did in the temple in the Old Testament.

5. **Community Aspect**: This communal aspect of priesthood also calls believers to support and care for one another, encouraging a collective spiritual growth and mutual responsibility within the body of Christ.

In summary, the New Testament's portrayal of every believer as a priest reflects a significant shift from a hierarchical structure to a more inclusive and accessible relationship with God, allowing each believer to partake in spiritual duties and responsibilities directly. This concept resonates with the Muslim understanding of individual accountability to God and the importance of personal faith, though there are clear theological distinctions between the beliefs of Muslims and Christians regarding the nature of Jesus and the concept of priesthood.
