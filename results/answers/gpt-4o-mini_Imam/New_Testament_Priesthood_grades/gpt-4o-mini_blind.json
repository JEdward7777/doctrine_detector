  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComments: The answer provides a solid explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers, backed up with relevant biblical references. The student effectively highlights key points such as believers' direct access to God, their sacrificial role, and the communal aspect of priesthood. The integration of verses from 1 Peter and Revelation adds depth to the answer. However, the reference to Muslim beliefs at the end is somewhat unnecessary in answering the question and slightly detracts from the focus on the Christian doctrine of priesthood. Overall, a strong response with room for minor improvement in staying focused on the Christian perspective."
