  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively explains the concept of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament. They utilized relevant biblical verses and examples to illustrate their points and demonstrated a clear understanding of the theological implications of believers being considered priests. The answer could have been strengthened by focusing more on the direct access to God in prayer aspect, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a strong and insightful response from a Christian worldview perspective."
