  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers within the Christian faith, referencing key biblical passages and theological implications. It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the New Testament foundations of this concept and highlighting the significance of every believer's role as a priest before God. The connection to prayer, intercession, and individual accountability is well articulated. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to more explicitly address the specific concern raised in the grading criteria throughout the response."
