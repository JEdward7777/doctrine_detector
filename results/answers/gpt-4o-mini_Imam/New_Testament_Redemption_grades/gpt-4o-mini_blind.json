They accurately highlight the shift from external rituals to a deeper spiritual meaning in the New Testament, particularly emphasizing Jesus's teachings on inner purity. The inclusion of examples, such as Jesus's criticism of the Pharisees and the symbolism of baptism, strengthens their argument. The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of the theological development of purification throughout biblical history from a Christian worldview."
