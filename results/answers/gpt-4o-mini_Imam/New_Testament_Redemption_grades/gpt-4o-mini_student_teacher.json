  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough comparison of purification concepts between the Old and New Testaments, demonstrating an understanding of the evolution from ritual-based purification to spiritual transformation through Jesus Christ. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification from sin. However, the student could strengthen their answer by more explicitly connecting the concept of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of purification in the New Testament to address the concern raised. Nonetheless, the answer reflects a solid grasp of the topic within a Christian worldview."
