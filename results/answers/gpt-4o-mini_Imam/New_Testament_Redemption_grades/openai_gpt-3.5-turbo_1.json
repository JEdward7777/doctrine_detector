The emphasis on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification from sin is clearly acknowledged and integrated well within the discussion. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating an understanding of the centrality of Christ's sacrifice in the process of purification. Great job!"
