  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of the concept of purification in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the shift from external rituals to inner spiritual transformation in the New Testament, centered on Jesus Christ's sacrifice. The focus on the sufficiency of Christ\u2019s sacrifice for eternal purification from sin is clearly articulated and aligns with Christian beliefs. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the student's response to the broader discussion of purification in the Old and New Testaments as shown in the main response. Overall, a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on purification is demonstrated."
