  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid analysis of the evidence in the New Testament suggesting that John the Baptist may have lived a life consistent with that of a Nazirite. The student effectively references relevant biblical passages and connects them to the Nazirite vow. The response could have been further strengthened by citing additional scholarly interpretations or historical context that support the argument. Additionally, a more explicit mention of the distinct requirements of a Nazirite vow from the Old Testament could enhance the response. Overall, this answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
