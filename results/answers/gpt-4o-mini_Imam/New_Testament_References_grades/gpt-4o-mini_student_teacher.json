  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 90. The student provided a well-organized and detailed explanation connecting various aspects of John the Baptist's life with potential Nazirite practices. They effectively referenced relevant Bible verses and provided logical reasoning to support their points. The student's answer aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer and demonstrates a strong understanding of the potential connection between John the Baptist and the Nazirite vow. The student's caution regarding differing scholarly opinions also shows a thoughtful approach to the question. Great job overall."
