  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Nazirite vow and its relevance to John the Baptist's life and ministry. They provide several well-supported arguments from the New Testament to support their claim that John may have been a Nazirite. The clarity and logical organization of the response are commendable. However, the absence of any direct reference to the angel's announcement to Zechariah regarding John's abstinence from strong drink could potentially weaken the argument. Nonetheless, the student's overall analysis and supporting evidence are strong enough to warrant a high grade."
