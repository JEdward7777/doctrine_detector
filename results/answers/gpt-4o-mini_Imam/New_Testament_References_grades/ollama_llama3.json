  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and well-supported connection between Old Testament practices (the Nazirite vow) and New Testament figures (John the Baptist). The discussion includes several relevant biblical passages and references to scholarly interpretations, which helps to establish the credibility of the argument. The writer also acknowledges the limitations of their interpretation, encouraging critical thinking and humility.\n\nTo take it to the next level, I would suggest adding more depth and nuance to the discussion. For example, exploring the cultural and historical contexts in which the Nazirite vow was practiced could provide additional insights into John's life and ministry. Additionally, addressing potential counterarguments or alternative interpretations could further strengthen the writer's case.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively connects Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to better understand biblical continuity."
