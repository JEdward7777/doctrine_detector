## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic belief, the narrative of Noah and his Ark is found in the Qur'an as well as the Bible. While I can provide an overview from the biblical perspective, it's important to note that in Islam, the story is significant for its moral and spiritual lessons rather than its historical specifics. 

According to the Bible, the purpose of Noah's Ark was to save Noah, his family, and pairs of every kind of animal from a great flood that God sent to cleanse the earth of its wickedness. Noah was selected by God as a righteous man who would preserve humanity and animal life. He was instructed to build the Ark to ensure the survival of these beings during the flood, which was a divine judgment against human corruption and sin.

In Islam, the story carries similar themes, emphasizing Noah's role as a prophet who warned his people of impending judgment. When they rejected his message, God commanded Noah to build the Ark to save those who believed in him and to preserve animal life for future generations.

Both narratives highlight themes of obedience, faith, divine mercy, and the consequences of turning away from God's guidance.
