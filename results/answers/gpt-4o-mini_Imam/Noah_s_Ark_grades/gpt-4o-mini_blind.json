However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize that the biblical account in Genesis is considered historical truth rather than just moral allegory. It would have been beneficial to stress the significance of Noah's obedience, God's judgment on sin, and His merciful preservation of life through the Ark as key doctrinal points in Christianity. Additionally, a clearer distinction between the biblical account and the perspective in Islam would enhance the response."
