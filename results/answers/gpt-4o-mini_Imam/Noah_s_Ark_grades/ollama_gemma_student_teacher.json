  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the purpose of Noah's Ark from both a biblical and Islamic perspective. They accurately summarized the main event and its significance for saving humanity and animal life from God's judgment. The inclusion of information about Islamic beliefs adds depth to the response, showing awareness of different interpretations of the story. However, it would be beneficial for the student to explicitly address the concern related to God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative of Noah's Ark."
