It effectively addresses the concern of understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation through the story of Noah. The only potential improvement could be to emphasize the concept of divine mercy and grace as central themes in God's plan of salvation as portrayed in the narrative of Noah's Ark, particularly from a Christian perspective."
