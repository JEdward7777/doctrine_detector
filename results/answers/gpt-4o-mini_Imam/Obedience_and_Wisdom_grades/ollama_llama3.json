  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive explanation of how listening to God connects with wisdom in Islam, covering various aspects such as guidance, application of knowledge, reflection, moral framework, humility, and community involvement. The writer effectively illustrates how these elements contribute to the development of wisdom, aligning their arguments with the given answer about obedience to God.\n\nThe concern about recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom is well-addressed in this response, as it highlights the importance of humbly obeying God's will in the pursuit of wisdom. The writer demonstrates a clear understanding that obedience to God is an essential aspect of becoming wise, which aligns with the given answer.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that some of the points could be further developed or illustrated with specific examples from Islamic teachings and practices. Additionally, while the response does an excellent job of exploring the connection between listening to God and wisdom, it could benefit from more explicit connections to the concept of obedience.\n\nOverall, this response provides a thoughtful and well-supported exploration of the link between listening to God and wisdom in Islam, making it an excellent example for understanding the relationship between these two concepts."
