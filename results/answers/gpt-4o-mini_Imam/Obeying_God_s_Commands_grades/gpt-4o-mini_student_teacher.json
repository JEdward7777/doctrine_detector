However, the answer did not specifically address the concern of the significance of obedience to God's commands within the context of the covenant, which is a crucial aspect of understanding the relationship between God and His people. The answer focused more on the general relationship between God and His people in Islam rather than emphasizing the importance of obedience in maintaining the covenant relationship."
