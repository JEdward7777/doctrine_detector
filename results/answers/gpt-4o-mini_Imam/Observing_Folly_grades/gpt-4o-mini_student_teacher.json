  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer by referencing specific verses from the Bible that categorize actions as folly. They effectively connected each example to the overarching biblical theme of wisdom versus folly. However, the student could improve by explicitly tying in the idea that folly leads to actions that are against God's will, as highlighted in the reference answer."
