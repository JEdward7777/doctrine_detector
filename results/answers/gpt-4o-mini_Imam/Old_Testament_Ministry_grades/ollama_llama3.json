  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a detailed and accurate account of the priests' ministry in the Old Testament, covering various aspects such as anointing and consecration, offering sacrifices, maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple, performing rituals and festivals, teaching the Law, judicial role, Cohanim and Levites, and weariness of sacred garments. The description is thorough and well-organized, making it easy to follow and understand.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response does not directly address the concern about recognizing Old Testament practices informing current ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service. While the response provides a comprehensive overview of priestly duties, it could be more explicitly connected to contemporary ministry applications.\n\nThe comment on this grade is: \"This response demonstrates strong knowledge of priestly ministry in the Old Testament, but could benefit from more explicit connections to current ministry contexts and sacrificial service.\""
