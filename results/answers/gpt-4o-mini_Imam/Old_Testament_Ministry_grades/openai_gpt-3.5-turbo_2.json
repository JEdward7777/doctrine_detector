The explanation is thorough and demonstrates an understanding of the significance of the priestly ministry in connecting the people with God. However, the response could be improved by explicitly linking the Old Testament practices of sacrificial service by the priests to inform current ministry approaches. A more explicit connection between the ancient practices and their relevance or application in contemporary ministry would enhance the response."
