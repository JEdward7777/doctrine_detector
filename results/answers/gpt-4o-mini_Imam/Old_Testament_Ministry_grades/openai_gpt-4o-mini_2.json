The understanding that priests facilitated a connection between God and the people through their sacrificial service aligns well with the concern about how the practices of the Old Testament can inform current ministry approaches. The response demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic and effectively connects the historical context to contemporary ministry perspectives."
