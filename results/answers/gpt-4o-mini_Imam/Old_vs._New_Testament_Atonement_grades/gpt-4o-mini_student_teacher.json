  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive comparison between the Old Testament and New Testament views on atonement and also touched on the Islamic perspective. However, the student's answer lacked a clear focus on the transition from temporary to permanent atonement as specified in the concern. The reference answer succinctly highlights this transition, which the student should have emphasized more clearly. Additionally, incorporating more specific biblical references and theological analysis within a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
