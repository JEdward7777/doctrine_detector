  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does address the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history, providing a good overview of how atonement was achieved through animal sacrifices in the Old Testament and Jesus' sacrifice in the New Testament. The inclusion of specific biblical references (Leviticus 16) and the distinction between the two Testaments are also strengths.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly highlighting the connection between the temporary blood sacrifices of the Old Testament and the permanent atonement offered through Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament. Additionally, while the introduction of Islamic perspectives is relevant to the concern, it may not directly address the question of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the development of atonement theology across biblical history, but could benefit from more explicit connections between the different concepts."
