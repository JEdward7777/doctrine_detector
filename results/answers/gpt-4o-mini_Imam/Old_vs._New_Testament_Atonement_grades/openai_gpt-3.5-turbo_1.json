  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history by contrasting the Old Testament practices of temporary blood sacrifices with the New Testament belief in Christ's single sacrifice as sufficient for all sins forever. The explanation is clear, well-supported by biblical references, and effectively addresses the concern raised. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a bit more depth on how Christ's sacrifice fulfills and surpasses the previous rituals of atonement in the Old Testament."
