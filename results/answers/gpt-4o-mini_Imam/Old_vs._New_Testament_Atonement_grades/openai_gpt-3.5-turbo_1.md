# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the concept of atonement is understood quite differently than in the Judeo-Christian tradition, but it is helpful to consider how these concepts are viewed in the Old Testament and New Testament.

In the **Old Testament**, atonement is often associated with sacrifices and rituals that were prescribed in the Mosaic Law. The primary method of atonement involved animal sacrifices, where the sin of the people could be symbolically transferred to the animal, which was then sacrificed (e.g., in Leviticus 16, the Day of Atonement). These acts were seen as necessary to maintain a right relationship with God, allowing for the forgiveness of sins and the restoration of the covenant relationship between God and His people.

In the **New Testament**, the understanding of atonement shifts significantly with the life and crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Christians believe that Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice—the "Lamb of God"—who takes away the sins of humanity (as mentioned in John 1:29). In this view, Jesus' death is seen as a singular and final act of atonement, fulfilling the requirements of the law and offering redemption to all who believe. This concept introduces ideas of grace and faith as pivotal to atonement, rather than reliance solely on actions or rituals.

In summary, the Old Testament emphasizes systematic rituals and sacrifices to atone for sin, while the New Testament focuses on the belief in Christ's sacrificial death as a universal atonement for sin, emphasizing faith and grace. 

From an Islamic perspective, it is important to note that Islam does not accept the concept of original sin or the necessity of a blood sacrifice for atonement. Instead, Islam teaches that individuals are responsible for their own deeds, and atonement can be sought through sincere repentance (Tawbah), prayer, and good deeds. God is always ready to forgive those who return to Him in sincere repentance, reflecting the merciful nature of Allah.

Comment: The response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history by contrasting the Old Testament practices of temporary blood sacrifices with the New Testament belief in Christ's single sacrifice as sufficient for all sins forever. The explanation is clear, well-supported by biblical references, and effectively addresses the concern raised. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a bit more depth on how Christ's sacrifice fulfills and surpasses the previous rituals of atonement in the Old Testament.
