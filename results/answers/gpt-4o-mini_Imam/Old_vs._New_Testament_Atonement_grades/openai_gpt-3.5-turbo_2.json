  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student accurately explains the transition from temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament to the permanent atonement through Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament. The response effectively addresses the concern by clearly outlining this significant change in biblical history. Additionally, the student provides a comprehensive comparison between the concepts of atonement in the Old and New Testaments, showcasing a solid understanding of the topic. The response could be improved by delving deeper into the theological implications of this transition from temporary to permanent atonement, but overall, it is a well-informed and well-articulated explanation."
