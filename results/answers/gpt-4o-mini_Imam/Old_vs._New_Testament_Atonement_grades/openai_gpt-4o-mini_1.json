It effectively contrasts the Old Testament rituals with the New Testament belief in Christ's ultimate sacrifice, showcasing the shift in understanding of atonement. The explanation aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the significance of Christ's sacrifice for all sins throughout eternity."
