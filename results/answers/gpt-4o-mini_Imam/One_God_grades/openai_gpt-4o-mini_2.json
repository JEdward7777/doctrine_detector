It incorporates a variety of strategies that respect cultural beliefs while firmly upholding the biblical truth of monotheism. The suggestions given align closely with the concern of properly teaching about one God while addressing cultural polytheism. This response demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful approach from a Christian worldview."
