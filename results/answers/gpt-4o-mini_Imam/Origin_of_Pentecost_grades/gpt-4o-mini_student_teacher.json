  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the historical and religious significance of the Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot, within Judaism. They connected it well to the themes of thanksgiving, spiritual renewal, and community worship. However, the student did not effectively connect the Festival of Weeks to its fulfillment in Christ as the reference answer did. The connection to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the early followers of Jesus could have been further expanded upon to align with the concern provided."
