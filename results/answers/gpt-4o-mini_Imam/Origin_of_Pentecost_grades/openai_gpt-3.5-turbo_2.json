The explanation draws a clear parallel between the Jewish tradition of celebrating the giving of the Law and the Christian understanding of the birth of the Christian Church through the Holy Spirit. The response could have included more Scriptural references to further support the connection between Shavuot and the fulfillment in Christ, but overall, it provides a strong Christian worldview perspective on the topic."
