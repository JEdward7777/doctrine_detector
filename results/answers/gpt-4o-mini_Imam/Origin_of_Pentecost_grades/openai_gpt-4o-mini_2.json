It also makes a clear connection to the biblical festival's fulfillment in Christ, highlighting the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the Christian Church during the Festival of Weeks in the New Testament. However, there is room for improvement in explicitly addressing how Shavuot prefigures or points towards Christ and the fulfillment of God's plan through Him. Further development in exploring the biblical festivals in light of Christ's redemptive work would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
