## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
Jesus' followers were first called "Christians" in the city of Antioch. This is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament, specifically in Acts 11:26, which states, "And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch, the disciples were first called Christians."

This designation reflects the followers' belief in Jesus as the Christ (or Messiah), and it marked a significant point in the early development of what would become Christianity as a distinct faith tradition.
