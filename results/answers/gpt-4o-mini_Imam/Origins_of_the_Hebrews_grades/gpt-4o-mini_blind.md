## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Biblical context, the Hebrews are primarily descended from the patriarch Abraham, who is considered a significant figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. According to the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), God made a covenant with Abraham, promising that he would become the father of a great nation. Abraham had two sons: Ishmael, who is traditionally regarded as the ancestor of many Arab peoples, and Isaac, who is considered the father of the Jewish people.

Isaac had two sons, Esau and Jacob. Jacob, later named Israel, is particularly important as he had twelve sons, who became the progenitors of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The tribes include Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher, Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. The descendants of these tribes are referred to as the Israelites or Hebrews.

The term "Hebrews" itself is often associated with the earlier nomadic lifestyle of these peoples, particularly during the time of Abraham and in the early narratives of their journey. Itâ€™s important to recognize that throughout history, the identity and understanding of the Hebrews have evolved, particularly during their time in Egypt, the Exodus, and their eventual establishment in the Promised Land.

In summary, the Hebrews are considered to be descendants of Abraham through Isaac and Jacob, forming the basis of the Israelite nation as described in the Bible.
