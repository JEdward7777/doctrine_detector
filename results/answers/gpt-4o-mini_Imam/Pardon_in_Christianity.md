## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islam, the concept of pardon and forgiveness is deeply rooted in the attributes of Allah (God). Muslims believe that Allah is Most Merciful (Ar-Rahman) and Most Forgiving (Al-Ghafoor), and that He is always ready to forgive those who sincerely repent for their sins. 

In contrast to the Christian concept of forgiveness through Jesus Christ, which is central to Christian theology, Islam maintains that direct forgiveness from Allah does not require an intercessor or mediator. In Islam, each individual has a personal relationship with God, and they are encouraged to seek forgiveness directly through repentance (tawbah).

The Quran emphasizes that Allah's mercy encompasses all things (Quran 7:156) and that He forgives those who repent sincerely (Quran 25:70). It is important to note that in Islam, while Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) is revered as a prophet and messenger of God, he is not viewed as divine nor as an intermediary in the way understood in Christianity. 

Thus, while both religions hold the concept of forgiveness in high esteem, the means by which forgiveness is obtained differs significantly. In Islam, the forgiveness of sins is accomplished through sincere repentance to Allah alone, without the need for any intermediary figure. This underscores the importance of individual accountability and the direct relationship between believers and their Creator.
