However, from a Christian worldview, the answer fails to acknowledge the fundamental theological belief that forgiveness of sin is made possible through Jesus Christ as the sacrificial Lamb of God. The central role of Jesus Christ in bridging the gap between humanity and God for the forgiveness of sins is a core tenet of Christian faith that should have been addressed in a comparison of forgiveness concepts between Islam and Christianity."
