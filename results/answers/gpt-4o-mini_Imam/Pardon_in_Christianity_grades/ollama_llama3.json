  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of exploring the concept of pardon and forgiveness in Islam, providing specific examples from the Quran and highlighting the differences between Islamic and Christian views on forgiveness. The writer also provides a clear and concise overview of the importance of individual accountability and the direct relationship between believers and their Creator in Islam.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response does not directly address the concern of exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness. While it touches on this theme, it could be more explicitly linked to the provided answer about the concept of pardon as seen in the New Covenant.\n\nThe comment on the grade would be:\n\n\"Your response is strong in its explanation of Islamic views on forgiveness, but could be improved by more explicitly linking your analysis to the concern about exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness. Additionally, it would be helpful to incorporate the provided answer about the concept of pardon in the New Covenant into your discussion to further strengthen your argument.\""
