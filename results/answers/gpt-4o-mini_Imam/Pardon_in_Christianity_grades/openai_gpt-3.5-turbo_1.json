It highlights the central role of Jesus in Christian theology for achieving forgiveness and the direct relationship believers have with God in Islam. The response emphasizes the important distinction between the two faiths in terms of mediator and personal accountability, addressing the concern raised about exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness with clarity and depth."
