The response effectively contrasts this with the Christian concept of forgiveness through Jesus Christ as central to Christian theology. However, the response could have further explored the relationship between pardon (forgiving and not punishing someone for their sins) and divine forgiveness in both Islam and Christianity to provide a more in-depth analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
