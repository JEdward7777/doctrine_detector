  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid explanation of the significance of Passover for Christians in relation to Jesus. They accurately highlight the connection between the Last Supper, the Eucharist, and the sacrificial nature of Jesus as the Lamb of God. The student effectively links the symbolism of Passover with Jesus' crucifixion and atonement for sins. Minor improvements could include deeper elaboration on the theological implications of the New Covenant established by Jesus and connecting it further to the Old Testament foreshadowing of His redemptive work. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
