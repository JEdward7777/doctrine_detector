In Islam, while Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) is highly regarded as one of the greatest prophets and messengers of God, the concept of faith in his sacrifice does not align with Islamic teachings. Instead, the Islamic perspective emphasizes direct faith in Allah (God) and the oneness of God (Tawhid). 

Muslims believe that all prophets, including Jesus, preached monotheism and submission to God's will. According to the Quran, Jesus was a servant of God and a messenger who called people to worship God alone. The concept of salvation in Islam is based on faith in God, righteous deeds, and the mercy of God rather than reliance on a sacrificial event.

In Islam, peace with God (which can be understood as salvation or Allah's pleasure) is achieved through:

1. **Belief in One God (Tawhid)**: The fundamental belief in the oneness of Allah is central to achieving peace with Him.
2. **Following the Prophets**: Believing in and respecting all prophets, including Jesus, while recognizing the finality of Prophet Muhammad's message.
3. **Righteous Deeds**: Engaging in good deeds, fulfilling religious obligations (such as prayer, fasting, and charity), and adhering to ethical conduct in everyday life.
4. **Repentance**: Seeking forgiveness for sins and making sincere repentance (Tawbah) is a crucial aspect of returning to God and achieving His mercy.

The Quran emphasizes God's mercy and forgiveness numerous times, indicating that sincere faith, sincere intention, and good deeds are the paths to His mercy and grace. 

In summary, while Jesus holds a significant and respected position in Islam, the belief in his sacrifice does not exist in Islamic theology. Instead, Muslims focus on a personal relationship with God through faith, righteous actions, and repentance to achieve peace with Him.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response focusing on the Islamic perspective regarding achieving peace with God. The explanation was clear and organized, addressing key components such as Tawhid, following the prophets, righteous deeds, and repentance in Islam. However, the response falls short in directly addressing the Christian perspective on faith in Jesus' sacrifice to achieve peace with God according to scripture, as the question specifically asked for scriptural references. To improve, the student could incorporate more specific references to Christian scriptures that highlight the significance of faith in Jesus' sacrifice for reconciliation with God.
