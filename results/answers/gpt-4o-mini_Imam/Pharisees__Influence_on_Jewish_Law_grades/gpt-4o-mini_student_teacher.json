They effectively highlight key points such as the conflict over interpretation, the contrast between legalism and grace, the Pharisees' role in religious authority, the evolution of early Christianity, and the post-resurrection context. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively connects it to broader theological implications. The only suggestion for improvement would be to more explicitly tie the Pharisees' focus on external adherence to the law to the specific conflicts they had with Jesus and early Christians as outlined in the reference answer."
