  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise overview of the Pharisees' role in Jesus' ministry, highlighting their strict adherence to the Laws of Moses as a source of conflict with Jesus and early Christians. It also touches on the Pharisees' legalistic approach, which emphasized ritual purity and external adherence to rules, and how this differed from Jesus' focus on the spirit of the Law.\n\nThe response is particularly strong in its exploration of the theological implications of the Pharisees' influence, including their role in shaping early Christian thought and practice. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the Book of Acts, adds depth and nuance to the discussion.\n\nOne area for improvement would be to provide more explicit connections between the Pharisees' actions and Jesus' teachings. While the response does a good job of summarizing the Pharisees' role, it could benefit from more detailed analysis of how their beliefs and practices influenced Jesus' message.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that provides a clear and thoughtful exploration of the Pharisees' role in Jesus' ministry. With some additional development, it has the potential to be even stronger."
