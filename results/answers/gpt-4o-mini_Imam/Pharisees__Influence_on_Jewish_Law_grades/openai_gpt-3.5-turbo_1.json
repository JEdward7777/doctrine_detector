It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Law of Moses posed challenges for Jesus in his ministry. The only area for improvement would be to further explore how Jesus engaged with individual Pharisees and the nuances of their interactions to deepen the understanding of the challenges faced."
