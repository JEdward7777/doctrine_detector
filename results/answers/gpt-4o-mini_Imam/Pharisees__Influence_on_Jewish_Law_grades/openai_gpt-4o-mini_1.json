It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting specific conflicts and theological differences that arose due to the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Law of Moses. The explanation is clear, supported by relevant examples from the Gospels and early Christian history. The integration of a Christian worldview is evident in discussing the themes of legalism versus grace and the evolution of early Christianity in response to Pharisaic practices. Overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on the Pharisees and their impact on Jesus' ministry."
