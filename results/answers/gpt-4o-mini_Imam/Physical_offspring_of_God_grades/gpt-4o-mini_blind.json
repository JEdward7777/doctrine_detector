However, the response could benefit from a more accurate and detailed explanation of the Christian understanding of the term \"Son of God\" within the context of the Trinity doctrine. The focus on Islamic theology, while informative, detracts from fully addressing the Christian perspective on the term. It is important to provide a clear comparison between the two perspectives and highlight the doctrinal differences, especially regarding the concept of God having a Son in Christianity."
