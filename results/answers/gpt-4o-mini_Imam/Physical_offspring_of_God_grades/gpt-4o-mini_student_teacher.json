The proper teaching to prevent doctrinal errors in this context would involve clearly explaining that the term \"Son of God\" in Christianity does not imply physical offspring of God, but rather signifies Jesus' divine nature and unique relationship with God. The response lacked this clarification and therefore did not effectively address the concern provided."
