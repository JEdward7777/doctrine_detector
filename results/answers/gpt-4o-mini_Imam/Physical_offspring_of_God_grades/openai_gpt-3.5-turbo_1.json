There is a missed opportunity to emphasize the unique Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God within the context of the Holy Trinity and to firmly establish the doctrinal accuracy of this belief. The response could have provided a more robust defense of the Christian doctrine to strengthen the retention of biblical terminology."
