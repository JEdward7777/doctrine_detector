However, the focus on Islamic theology in addressing the concern about retaining biblical terminology is not directly relevant. It would have been more appropriate to emphasize the importance of understanding the term within a Christian worldview and provide explanations or scriptural references from a Christian perspective to prevent doctrinal errors."
