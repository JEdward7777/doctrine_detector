  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective on physical death and spiritual perishing, relating it to distance from Allah, loss of faith, and moral decline. However, the answer lacks integration of the Christian worldview which focuses on the eternal consequences of spiritual death and the importance of belief in Jesus for salvation. The student's response, while well-written and insightful from an Islamic viewpoint, does not address the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death specifically within a Christian context."
