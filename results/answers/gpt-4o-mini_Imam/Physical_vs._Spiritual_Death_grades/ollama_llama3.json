However, it does not directly address the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding.\n\nThe response primarily focuses on explaining the concepts of physical and spiritual perishing within an Islamic framework, which is relevant to the concern but not directly addressing it. The answer provided at the beginning seems disconnected from the rest of the response, as it does not explicitly address the distinction between physical and spiritual death.\n\nTo improve the response, it would be helpful to provide a more explicit comparison between physical and spiritual death, emphasizing how they differ in terms of their consequences and implications for one's faith. Additionally, incorporating scriptural references or theological insights from Christian tradition could enhance the response by providing a broader perspective on the topic."
