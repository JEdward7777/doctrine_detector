  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does a good job of explaining the Islamic perspective on physical death and spiritual perishing within a theological framework. The student effectively addresses the concern by providing a clear distinction between physical and spiritual death based on Islamic beliefs. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is that the response does not incorporate the Christian perspective highlighted in the provided answer. By including some references or comparisons to the Christian view of eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus, the response could have been more comprehensive and reflective of the given answer."
