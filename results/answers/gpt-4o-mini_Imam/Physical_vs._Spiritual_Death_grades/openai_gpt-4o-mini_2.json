However, it does not address the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding. From a Christian worldview, the eternal consequences tied to spiritual perishing due to a lack of trust in Jesus are not explicitly addressed in the Islamic perspective presented. Clarification on how this contrasts with Christian beliefs would have been beneficial for a more comprehensive comparison."
