However, the student's answer may have included some practices that were not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the additional details enhance the depth of understanding, it strays slightly from the simplicity of the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic and provides valuable insights into the practices of early Christian fellowship."
