It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life. The connection to seeking God urgently for help, trusting in Him, and depending on Him is well-supported through Islamic teachings and practices. Great job in presenting a Christian worldview on the significance of prayer and reliance on God in the context of the Islamic tradition."
