  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student provides a decent explanation of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" from a biblical perspective, highlighting its significance in prophetic literature. However, the answer loses focus by shifting to compare Islamic perspectives on prophecy and the significance of Jerusalem. While acknowledging different faith traditions is important, in this context, the response strays from the specific biblical interpretation of the term. The student could improve their grade by honing in on the scriptural understanding of \"Daughter of Zion\" and how it is utilized in biblical prophecies without delving into comparisons with other religious traditions."
