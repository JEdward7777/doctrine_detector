  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a good understanding of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" within the Biblical context, explaining its symbolic significance and different applications in prophetic literature. However, the student's response wandered off-topic by discussing Islamic perspectives and interpretations, which was not required or relevant to the question. The student should have focused more on the prophetic nature and historical context within the Christian worldview."
