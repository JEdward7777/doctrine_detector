  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response from an Islamic perspective, the answer did not address the concern of finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose as described in the Bible specifically. The focus was on Islamic teachings and practices, which may not directly align with Christian beliefs. The student did offer valuable insights on self-reflection, prayer, seeking knowledge, and community service, which are commendable principles across various faith traditions. However, a stronger connection to Christian teachings and practices related to discerning one's calling as outlined in the reference answer would have improved the grade."
