  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-structured guide from an Islamic perspective on how to discern one's purpose in life, aligning with Christian values of prayer, seeking guidance, and understanding gifts and passions. The emphasis on serving Allah and humanity, seeking knowledge, community service, and aligning with core teachings reflects a strong Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is due to the lack of direct reference to the Holy Spirit in the provided response, but overall, the guidance aligns well with a Christian-specific concern on finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose."
