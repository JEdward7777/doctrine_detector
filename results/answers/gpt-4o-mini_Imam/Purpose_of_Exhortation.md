## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
As an Imam, my perspective is rooted in Islamic teachings, but I can provide you with some insights about the concept of exhortation as it appears in the New Testament from a general Christian perspective.

In the New Testament, the primary purpose of exhortation is to encourage, strengthen, and urge believers to grow in their faith and live according to God's will. Exhortation is often aimed at promoting moral behavior, spiritual growth, and community support among believers. For instance, passages such as Hebrews 10:24-25 encourage Christians to motivate one another to love and good deeds, emphasizing the importance of community and mutual support in maintaining faith.

Additionally, exhortation can serve to correct or admonish individuals who may stray from the teachings of Christianity, helping to guide them back to the right path. Overall, the aim is to foster a strong, supportive, and spiritually vibrant community of believers.
