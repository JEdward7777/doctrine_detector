  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nWhile the student's answer demonstrates a general understanding of the purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, it lacks specificity in addressing the concern related to encouraging others in their faith journey. The response focuses primarily on encouraging moral behavior and spiritual growth, but fails to elaborate on how exhortation can specifically support individuals in their faith development and challenges. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic teachings in the response is not relevant to the Christian-specific worldview specified in the concern."
