The writer provides some general information about exhortation in the New Testament, mentioning its purpose to encourage, strengthen, and urge believers to grow in their faith. They also cite specific passages, such as Hebrews 10:24-25, which support this concept.\n\nHowever, the response does not fully address the concern, as it only provides a general overview of exhortation in the New Testament without delving deeper into its biblical basis or exploring specific Scriptures that support this concept. Additionally, while the writer attempts to provide some insights from a Christian perspective, their main focus is on sharing their own Islamic perspective and offering assistance with questions about Islam.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates some understanding of the biblical concept of exhortation but could be improved by providing more detailed biblical support and exploring specific Scriptures that relate to encouraging others in their faith journey."
