  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the concept of exhortation in the New Testament to the idea of encouraging believers to grow in their faith and live according to God's will. It accurately portrays exhortation as a means of promoting moral behavior, spiritual growth, and community support among Christians. The incorporation of biblical passages, such as Hebrews 10:24-25, adds depth to the explanation. However, the answer could have further emphasized the importance of love, compassion, and grace in encouraging others on their faith journey, reflecting the Christian understanding of exhortation as not only persuasion but also rooted in genuine care and support."
