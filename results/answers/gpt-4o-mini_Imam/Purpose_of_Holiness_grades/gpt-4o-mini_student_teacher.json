  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer, while informative about Islamic perspectives on holiness, does not directly address the question from a Christian worldview. The focus on Islamic teachings, while interesting, does not fulfill the requirement of discussing holiness in a Christian context. The answer lacks specific application of Christian beliefs and practices related to living a holy life. Further integration of Christian principles and scripture would have been beneficial in addressing the concern raised in the question from a Christian perspective."
