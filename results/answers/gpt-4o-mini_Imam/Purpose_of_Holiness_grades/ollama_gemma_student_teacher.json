  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of holiness from an Islamic perspective. They effectively highlight various principles that foster a life dedicated to God's purpose, aligning them with Christian teachings where applicable. The response is well-written and demonstrates respect for both Islamic and Christian beliefs. However, it would benefit from a more explicit connection to Christian teachings and practices as requested in the concern."
