However, from a Christian worldview, it is crucial to highlight that Jesus used parables not only to illustrate complex ideas and engage his audience but primarily to reveal spiritual truths about the Kingdom of God to those who have ears to hear. Additionally, the aspect of concealment of truths in parables should be understood in terms of spiritual discernment rather than the idea of veiling truths based on one's willingness to listen. The response would benefit from focusing more on the redemptive and salvific aspects of Jesus' parables within Christian doctrine."
