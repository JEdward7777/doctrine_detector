The response lacked a direct reference to Jesus' intention to reveal truth to his disciples while concealing it from unbelievers, which is a key aspect of the Christian perspective on the use of parables. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the specific teachings of Jesus in the Bible and how they impact faith would strengthen their answer from a Christian worldview."
