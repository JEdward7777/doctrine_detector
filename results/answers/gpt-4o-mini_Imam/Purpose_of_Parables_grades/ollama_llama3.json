  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a thoughtful and well-organized exploration of Jesus' use of parables, covering various aspects such as illustration, engagement, reflection, concealment, and moral instruction. The writer's analysis is informed by both Christian and Islamic perspectives, which adds depth to the discussion.\n\nThe response aligns well with the concern about understanding Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith. The writer provides a nuanced view of parables as not only conveying truth but also encouraging reflection, personal interpretation, and moral guidance. The summary statement effectively synthesizes the main points, emphasizing the power of parables in Jesus' teachings.\n\nTo reach a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the use of parables to Jesus' broader teaching methods and their implications for faith. However, as it stands, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' parabolic teachings and their significance."
