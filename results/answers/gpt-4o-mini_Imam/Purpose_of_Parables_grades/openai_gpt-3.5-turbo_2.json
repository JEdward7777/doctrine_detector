  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and insightful analysis of why Jesus used parables in his teachings, demonstrating a good understanding of the implications for faith. The explanation aligns well with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the purposes of parables in revealing truths to believers and concealing them from those who do not have faith. The discussion on how parables engage the audience, encourage reflection, and provide moral guidance is thorough and reflects a solid grasp of the topic. The response could be strengthened by explicitly referencing the Christian perspective on the use of parables by Jesus, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
