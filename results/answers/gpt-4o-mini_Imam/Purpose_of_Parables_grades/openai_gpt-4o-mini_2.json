It effectively explains how parables serve to engage the audience, encourage reflection, and convey moral and ethical instruction. The focus on revealing truth to believers while concealing it from unbelievers is well-addressed within the broader context of Jesus' teaching methods and their significance for faith. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be essential to emphasize more strongly the role of parables in illustrating the kingdom of God and pointing to deeper spiritual truths related to salvation and the person of Jesus Christ as the Son of God. This deeper theological aspect could have been more explicitly highlighted to enhance the alignment with a Christian-specific perspective."
