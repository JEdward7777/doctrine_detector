In the context of Islamic understanding, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is viewed as one of the great prophets of Allah. While the Qur'an does not provide a detailed account of Jesus' use of parables as found in the Bible, it does align with the idea that prophets often use various forms of communication to convey their messages effectively.

The primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings can generally be understood as follows:

1. **Illustration of Complex Ideas**: Parables serve to illustrate profound theological and moral ideas in a simple and relatable manner. By using familiar scenarios, Jesus made his teachings accessible to people from different backgrounds.

2. **Engagement of the Audience**: Parables engage listeners’ imaginations and encourage them to think deeply about the messages being conveyed. This engagement can lead to personal reflection and a stronger connection to the teachings.

3. **Encouragement of Reflection and Interpretation**: Parables often require the audience to reflect on their meanings and draw conclusions. This stimulates critical thinking and personal interpretation, leading to a more profound understanding of spiritual truths.

4. **Concealment of Truths**: In some cases, parables serve to reveal truths to those who are open to understanding while concealing them from those who are unwilling to listen or learn. This aspect emphasizes the idea that divine wisdom is sometimes veiled and that one must seek understanding earnestly.

5. **Moral and Ethical Instruction**: Many of Jesus’ parables also aim to teach moral lessons and ethical behavior, guiding people on how to live righteous lives in accordance with God's will.

In summary, the use of parables is a powerful teaching tool that aligns with the broader practice of prophets conveying divine messages in ways that resonate with their audiences, fostering reflection, understanding, and moral guidance.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the purpose and implications of Jesus using parables to teach moral truths. It effectively explains how parables serve to engage the audience, encourage reflection, and convey moral and ethical instruction. The focus on revealing truth to believers while concealing it from unbelievers is well-addressed within the broader context of Jesus' teaching methods and their significance for faith. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be essential to emphasize more strongly the role of parables in illustrating the kingdom of God and pointing to deeper spiritual truths related to salvation and the person of Jesus Christ as the Son of God. This deeper theological aspect could have been more explicitly highlighted to enhance the alignment with a Christian-specific perspective.
