While the answer focuses on the positive outcomes of tests, it could have further highlighted the role of tests in exposing sin, enabling believers to turn away from sin, and drawing them closer to Allah, as emphasized in the Christian perspective. The student effectively addressed the concern by demonstrating how understanding the nature of tests can shape a believer's response to difficult circumstances."
