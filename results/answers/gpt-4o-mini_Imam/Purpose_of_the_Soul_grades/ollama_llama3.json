  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the concept of the soul in Islamic theology, highlighting its connection to God, creation, purpose, spiritual growth, accountability, and acts of worship. The inclusion of specific Quranic verses and Hadiths adds depth and authority to the discussion. The writer's ability to weave these concepts together effectively demonstrates a strong understanding of the soul's role in relation to God.\n\nThe only deduction I would make is for the response's lack of direct connection to the concern about recognizing the soul's role influencing a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. While the response touches on this idea through mentions of accountability and nurturing the soul, it could be more explicitly tied to the concern.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a strong understanding of Islamic teachings related to the soul and its connection to God. With some further development of how these concepts can influence a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions, it would be even stronger."
