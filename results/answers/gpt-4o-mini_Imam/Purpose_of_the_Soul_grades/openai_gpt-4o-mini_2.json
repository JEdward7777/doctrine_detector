It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how understanding the soul's role in relation to God impacts a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. The scriptural references and teachings from the Qur'an and Hadith strengthen the argument and demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective. The connection between the soul, worship, accountability, spiritual growth, and acts of worship is clearly articulated, contributing to a thorough and insightful analysis within the Islamic theological framework."
