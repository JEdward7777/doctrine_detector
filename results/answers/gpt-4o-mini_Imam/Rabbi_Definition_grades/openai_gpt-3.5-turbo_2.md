## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Christian teaching, the term 'Rabbi' is derived from the Hebrew word meaning "my teacher" or "my master." It typically refers to a Jewish religious leader or teacher, particularly one who is qualified to interpret Jewish law and scripture. In the New Testament, Jesus is often referred to as "Rabbi" by His disciples and others, indicating His role as a teacher and His authority in spiritual matters.

In Christianity, acknowledging Jesus as Rabbi emphasizes His role in guiding His followers in matters of faith and ethics, as well as His teachings regarding the Kingdom of God, morality, and the interpretation of scripture. While the term is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, it also highlights Jesusâ€™ connection to the Jewish faith and the continuity of spiritual teaching that is significant in both Judaism and Christianity.
