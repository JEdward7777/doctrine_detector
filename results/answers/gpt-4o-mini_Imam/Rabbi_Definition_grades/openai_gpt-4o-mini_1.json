It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament and how Jesus is portrayed as a Rabbi in His teaching ministry. The response demonstrates an understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively links the Jewish and Christian perspectives on the term. Great job overall!"
