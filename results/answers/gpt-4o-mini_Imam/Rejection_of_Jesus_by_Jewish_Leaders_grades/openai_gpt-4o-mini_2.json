It delves into the theological differences, challenge to authority, political context, and cultural factors that influenced the rejection. The Christian worldview is clearly demonstrated through the emphasis on divine missions, the conflict between earthly authority and recognizing the Messiah. The response also acknowledges the sensitivities surrounding this topic in Jewish-Christian relations and highlights the implications for Christian beliefs. Overall, it effectively addresses the concern about authority, faith, and the recognition of the Messiah within a Christian framework."
