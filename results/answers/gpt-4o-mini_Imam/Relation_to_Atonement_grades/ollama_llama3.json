It also attempts to relate these concepts to each other, acknowledging that both involve reconciliation between God and humanity. However, while the response addresses the concern to clarify the differences and similarities between the two terms, it could be more explicit in drawing out the specific ways in which they differ or are similar. The connection between propitiation and appeasing God's wrath is also not fully developed in this response, leaving room for further exploration. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic theology and provides useful insights into the concepts of atonement and propitiation."
