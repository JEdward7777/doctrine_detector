  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-explained and detailed response highlighting the importance of repentance in avoiding the wrath of God and receiving His mercy. The student referenced relevant Bible verses to support their points effectively. However, the student could have further emphasized the direct relationship between repentance and the wrath of God as the teacher's reference answer did."
