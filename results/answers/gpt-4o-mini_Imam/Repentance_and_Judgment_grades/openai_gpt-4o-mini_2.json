It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the necessity of repentance for avoiding God's judgment and receiving His mercy. The inclusion of Bible verses and explanations from both the Old and New Testaments enriches the response and supports its argument well. The writing is clear, well-structured, and aligned with Christian teachings on repentance. Great job!"
