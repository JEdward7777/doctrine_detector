However, it could have been improved by emphasizing the importance of seeking guidance from God through prayer, rather than just mentioning it briefly. Additionally, a stronger tie to the theological significance of the event, such as demonstrating the sovereignty of God in choosing His representatives, would have further enriched the response from a Christian perspective."
