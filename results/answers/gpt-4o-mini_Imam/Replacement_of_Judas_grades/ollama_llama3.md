## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and subsequently died, the remaining eleven apostles sought to replace him to restore their number to twelve. According to the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 1:15-26), Matthias was chosen by casting lots. The apostles prayed for guidance, and ultimately, Matthias was selected to take Judas's place among the twelve apostles.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension by accurately describing the process of choosing Matthias to replace Judas. The mention of casting lots and prayer for guidance also shows an understanding of the importance of divine guidance in this decision.

However, the response could be improved by providing more context about the significance of maintaining the twelve apostles as a symbol of Jesus' ministry and the importance of Matthias' selection in terms of the ongoing mission of the church. Additionally, while the response is accurate, it could benefit from a deeper engagement with the biblical text and its themes.

Comment: Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the event surrounding Judas' replacement but could be strengthened by providing more depth and context to the significance of this event in the broader narrative of Jesus' ministry and the early church.
