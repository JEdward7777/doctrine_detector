  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death, aligning with the biblical account in Acts. The response also addresses the concern by acknowledging the importance of maintaining continuity in apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. However, the grade is slightly reduced due to the lack of further elaboration on the theological significance or implications of this event within Christian theology."
