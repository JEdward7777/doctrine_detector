## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and subsequently died, the remaining eleven apostles sought to replace him to restore their number to twelve. According to the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 1:15-26), Matthias was chosen by casting lots. The apostles prayed for guidance, and ultimately, Matthias was selected to take Judas's place among the twelve apostles.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death, aligning with the biblical account in Acts. The response also addresses the concern by acknowledging the importance of maintaining continuity in apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. However, the grade is slightly reduced due to the lack of further elaboration on the theological significance or implications of this event within Christian theology.
