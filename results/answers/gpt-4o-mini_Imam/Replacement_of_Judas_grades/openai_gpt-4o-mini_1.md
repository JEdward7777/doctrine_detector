## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
After Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus and subsequently died, the remaining eleven apostles sought to replace him to restore their number to twelve. According to the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 1:15-26), Matthias was chosen by casting lots. The apostles prayed for guidance, and ultimately, Matthias was selected to take Judas's place among the twelve apostles.
