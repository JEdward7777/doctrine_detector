## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic teachings, it is important to clarify that Muslims do not believe that Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) was crucified. The Quran states in Surah An-Nisa (4:157) that it appeared so to the people, but they did not actually crucify him. Therefore, when discussing Peter addressing the crowd about their role in the crucifixion, this would pertain to Christian texts and beliefs rather than Islamic teachings.

In the Christian tradition, specifically in the New Testament (Acts 2:22-23), Peter is recorded as addressing the crowd on the day of Pentecost, speaking about Jesus' miracles, the prophecy of his suffering, and importantly, mentioning that they played a role in his death, saying that Jesus was delivered up according to God's plan, but also highlighting their responsibility in the act of crucifixion.

For Muslims, however, the emphasis lies on the belief in the miraculous aspect of Jesus' life and his ascension, while the event of the crucifixion is viewed differently than in Christian theology. If you have questions related to Islamic beliefs and teachings specifically, feel free to ask!
