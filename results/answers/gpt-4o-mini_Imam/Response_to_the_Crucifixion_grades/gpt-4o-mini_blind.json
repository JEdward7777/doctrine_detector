However, the response focused more on clarifying Islamic beliefs about the crucifixion of Jesus rather than directly answering the question from a Christian perspective. It's important to stay focused on the specific teachings relevant to Christianity when addressing questions about biblical events. In this case, the discussion on Islamic beliefs, though informative, was not directly related to the question asked."
