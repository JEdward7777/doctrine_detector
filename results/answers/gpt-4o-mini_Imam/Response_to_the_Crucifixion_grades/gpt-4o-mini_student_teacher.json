However, the student did not directly address how Peter specifically addressed the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion, which was the main focus of the question. The answer could have been improved by incorporating more insights on the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
