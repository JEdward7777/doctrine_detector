However, the response lacks depth in connecting this message to evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel as specified in the concern. It would have been stronger if it delved deeper into the implications of Peter's message on shaping the early church's preaching and understanding of salvation through faith in Jesus."
