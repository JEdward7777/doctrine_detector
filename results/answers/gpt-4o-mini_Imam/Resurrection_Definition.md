## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In a Christian context, the term "resurrection" primarily refers to the belief in the rising of Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. This event is central to Christian faith, signifying Jesus' victory over sin and death, and is celebrated each year on Easter Sunday.

Additionally, Christians believe in a future resurrection of the dead, where all individuals will be raised from the dead at the end of times to face judgment. This belief is rooted in various passages from the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul and the Gospels, where it is presented as a promise of eternal life for believers.

In contrast, Islamic beliefs about resurrection also emphasize the idea of being raised from the dead but differ in specifics regarding Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. In Islam, it is believed that Jesus was not crucified but was raised to heaven by God, and that all humans will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment for their deeds.
