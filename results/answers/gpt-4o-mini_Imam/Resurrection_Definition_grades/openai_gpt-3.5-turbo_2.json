  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the Christian concept of resurrection. It effectively connects the term 'resurrection' to the Christian belief in Jesus' resurrection and its significance in the faith. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the fundamental concept of resurrection within a Christian context and effectively relates it to beliefs about life after death. The only suggestion for improvement would be to elaborate further on how the belief in resurrection impacts Christian views on eternal life and salvation."
