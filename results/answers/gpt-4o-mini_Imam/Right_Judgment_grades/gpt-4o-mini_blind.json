  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed analysis of Luke 6:37 from an Islamic perspective, which is not the requested viewpoint. The student fails to address the specific Christian understanding of judgment and condemnation outlined in the verse. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness by not focusing on Christian teachings regarding judgment and forgiveness. It is important for the student to stick to the requested Christian worldview when responding to such questions."
