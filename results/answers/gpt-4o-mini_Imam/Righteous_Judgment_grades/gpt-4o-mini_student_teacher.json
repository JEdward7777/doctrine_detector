  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response from a Christian perspective, addressing the reconciliation of God's wrath with His loving and merciful nature. They effectively explore key concepts such as God's holiness, love, justice, mercy, and the ultimate purpose of God's wrath. The student also integrates the example of Christ and the redemptive nature of God's actions. While the response is insightful and well-structured, it could have included more direct references to Biblical verses to strengthen the arguments and support the Christian perspective further."
