However, there are significant inaccuracies and theological deviations from a Christian perspective. The inclusion of Islamic beliefs and teachings, especially the comparison with Islamic beliefs on angels, may lead to confusion and misrepresentation of Christian doctrine. The focus should be on presenting the Christian understanding of angels' roles based on biblical references only. Additionally, some biblical references used could be expanded upon or clarified further for a more detailed understanding of how angels serve God in Christianity."
