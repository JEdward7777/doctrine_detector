It accurately highlights the key ways angels serve God in delivering messages, protecting individuals, and executing God's will. The inclusion of biblical references and parallels in Islamic belief demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing how Christians may perceive divine intervention through the roles of angels. Well done!"
