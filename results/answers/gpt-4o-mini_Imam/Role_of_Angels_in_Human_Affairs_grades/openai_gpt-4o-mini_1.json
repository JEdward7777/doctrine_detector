It highlights key roles such as messengers, worshipers, guardians, ministers of God's will, helpers of humans, and record keepers. The inclusion of scriptural references adds credibility to the explanation. The response effectively addresses the concern by acknowledging that understanding the roles of angels can impact how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives. Overall, this is a well-informed and well-structured response from a Muslim Imam that respects the Christian perspective on angels."
