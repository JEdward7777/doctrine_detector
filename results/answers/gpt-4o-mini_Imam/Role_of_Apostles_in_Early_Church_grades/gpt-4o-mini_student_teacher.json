  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful response, drawing parallels between the actions of the apostles and Islamic teachings. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of understanding community and teaching as integral aspects of church life, as modeled by the apostles in a Christian context. The response focuses more on Islamic perspectives and principles rather than specifically examining the apostles' actions within a Christian worldview. A lower grade is given due to the lack of direct relevance to the concern provided."
