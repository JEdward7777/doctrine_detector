The student effectively applied the principles of unity, teaching through example, community support, inclusivity, education, prayer as a community, and encouraging dialogue within an Islamic framework. However, there could have been more direct connections drawn between the apostles' actions in the early church and how those principles can be similarly applied in a Muslim community context. Additionally, clearer references to Scriptural foundations in the Islamic faith could have strengthened the argument."
