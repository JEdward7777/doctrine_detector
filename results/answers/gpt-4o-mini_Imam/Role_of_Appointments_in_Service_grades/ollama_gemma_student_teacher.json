  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of fulfilling roles within the Church from a Christian perspective. They provide relevant examples of service, leadership, stewardship, unity, discipleship, and moral living. However, the answer lacks specific references to Christian teachings or scriptures, which would have strengthened the response. Additionally, the inclusion of insights from a Muslim perspective, while interesting, is not directly relevant to the Christian-specific worldview specified in the question and concern."
