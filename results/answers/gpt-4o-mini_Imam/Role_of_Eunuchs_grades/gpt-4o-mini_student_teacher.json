However, the response deviates from the Christian worldview, as it emphasizes Islamic teachings and the Quran rather than the Christian perspective. While the student made insightful points about valuing individual contributions and challenging traditional notions, the focus on Islamic principles did not directly address the concern from a Christian-specific worldview."
