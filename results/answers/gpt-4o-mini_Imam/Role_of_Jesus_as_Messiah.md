## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) holds a significant role as a prophet and messenger of God, but his relationship to the concept of kingship is understood differently than in Christian theology.

In Christianity, Jesus is often seen as the Messiah who establishes a spiritual kingdom, with implications of a physical reign in the future. However, in Islam, Jesus is recognized as the Messiah ("Al-Masih") but without the connotation of a divine kingship or sovereignty as understood in Christian thought. Instead, he is viewed as a servant of God who performed miracles and conveyed the message of monotheism.

The concept of the "kingdom" in Islamic eschatology is tied to the Day of Judgment and the eventual establishment of God's justice and authority. Islam teaches that Jesus will play a significant role during the end times, returning to restore justice and defeat falsehood. His coming is associated with establishing truth and righteousness, guiding people back to the worship of the one true God.

While Jesus is not seen as establishing a kingdom in the earthly sense during his lifetime according to Islamic beliefs, his role as the Messiah is to lead and correct, ultimately contributing to God's plan for humanity, culminating in a divine order at the end of times.

In summary, while the concept of kingship and a kingdom can be related to Jesus' role in both Christian and Islamic contexts, the Islamic view emphasizes his prophetic mission, his role in eschatology, and ultimately the sovereignty of God, rather than a personal kingship.
