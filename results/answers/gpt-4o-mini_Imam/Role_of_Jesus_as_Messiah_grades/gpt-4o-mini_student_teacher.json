However, they missed recognizing the crucial importance of Jesus' role in God's plan for humanity, which is central to understanding the significance of his kingship. In a Christian worldview, Jesus' role as the Messiah goes beyond just establishing a kingdom; it is about salvation, redemption, and God's ultimate plan for humanity through His Son. The student's answer would have been stronger if they had emphasized this key aspect."
