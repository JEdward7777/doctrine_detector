  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful explanation of how the title \"the Word of God\" ascribed to Jesus highlights his nature in Christianity, addressing key theological concepts such as Jesus' pre-existence, divine nature, role in creation, incarnation, revelation of God, and relationship with believers. The student effectively conveyed the significance of Jesus' divinity and role in revealing God, resonating with the Christian worldview. However, the student's response could have more directly mirrored the concise and focused reference answer provided by the teacher to receive a higher grade."
