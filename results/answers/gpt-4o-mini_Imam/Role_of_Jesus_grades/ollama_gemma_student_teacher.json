They demonstrate a clear understanding of the key concepts and theological perspectives surrounding Jesus' sacrifice, resurrection, and mediation. \n\nThe response also thoughtfully addresses the concern of clarifying Jesus' role within the Christian faith. While the student acknowledges the Muslim perspective on Jesus as a prophet, they remain focused on the Christian understanding of His salvific work. This demonstrates respect for both perspectives and avoids unnecessary controversy.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement in the conclusion. It would be beneficial to explicitly connect the student's explanation of Jesus' role with the provided reference answer, reinforcing the idea that the Bible clearly teaches Jesus' centrality in salvation."
