  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive answer discussing the influence of Jewish religious leaders on the crucifixion of Jesus, considering concerns about authority, accusations and trial, role in the Roman trial, political motivations, and theological perspectives. However, the answer contained unnecessary information about Islamic perspectives on Jesus and lacked a clear focus on the specific concern of reflecting on the historical context of Jesus' death and the dynamics between religious authority and civil power. The reference answer succinctly highlighted the main point, which the student could have emphasized more in their response."
