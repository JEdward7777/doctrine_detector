## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The Prophet Nathan utilized a parable to confront King David about his sin with Bathsheba and the murder of her husband, Uriah, in a very impactful way. This incident is found in the Bible, specifically in 2 Samuel 12:1-7. 

Nathan approached David and told him a parable about two men in a city—one rich and the other poor. The rich man had many flocks and herds, while the poor man had only one little ewe lamb that he loved dearly. When a traveler came to the rich man, instead of taking from his own abundant flocks to prepare a meal, the rich man took the poor man’s lamb, which was like a daughter to him, and prepared it for the guest.

Upon hearing this story, David was enraged and declared that the rich man deserved to die and must repay the poor man fourfold for the one lamb he had stolen. Nathan then revealed that the parable was a metaphor for David’s own actions, saying, "You are the man!" This bold statement made the connection clear, highlighting David's wrongdoing in a way that called for reflection rather than direct accusation. 

Nathan's use of the parable was a powerful method of addressing King David's sin, provoking him to acknowledge his guilt and prompting repentance, which is a significant theme in both the Biblical and Islamic understanding of accountability and the importance of recognizing one’s sins. In Islamic teachings, the approach of using stories or parables to convey moral lessons is also appreciated as a means to guide individuals toward reflection and repentance.
