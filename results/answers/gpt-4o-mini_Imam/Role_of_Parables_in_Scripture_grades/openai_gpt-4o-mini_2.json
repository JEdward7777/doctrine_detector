  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a solid comprehension of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, specifically citing the example of Prophet Nathan and King David. The student accurately explains how Nathan's use of a parable led to David's acknowledgment and repentance of his sin. The connection between the biblical narrative and the concern is well-established, but the mention of Islamic teachings, while interesting, somewhat detracts from the focus on the Christian worldview. Overall, a strong understanding of the use of parables within biblical contexts."
