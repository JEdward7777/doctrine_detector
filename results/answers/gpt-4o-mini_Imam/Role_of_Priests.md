## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Old Testament, priests had several key responsibilities that were central to the religious life of the Israelites. Here are the main duties:

1. **Offering Sacrifices:** Priests were responsible for performing sacrifices on behalf of the people, which included burnt offerings, sin offerings, and peace offerings, among others. This was a primary means of worship and atonement for sins.

2. **Conducting Rituals:** They conducted various rituals and ceremonies, including the observance of the festivals and the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), where they played a significant role in seeking forgiveness for the community.

3. **Maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple:** Priests were tasked with the care and maintenance of the Tabernacle (and later the Temple), ensuring it remained a holy place, and they performed duties related to the sanctuary.

4. **Teaching the Law:** They were responsible for teaching the Law of Moses to the people, guiding them in their religious and moral obligations, and ensuring that the community adhered to Godâ€™s commandments.

5. **Intercession:** Priests acted as intermediaries between God and the people. They prayed for the people, offered blessings, and sought God's favor on their behalf.

6. **Purification Rights:** They oversaw purification rituals for individuals and for objects that had become ritually impure, ensuring the community maintained spiritual cleanliness.

7. **Judicial Functions:** In some cases, priests had roles in resolving disputes and making judgments on matters of the Law.

These responsibilities highlight the priests' essential role in maintaining the spiritual health of the Israelite community and their relationship with God.
