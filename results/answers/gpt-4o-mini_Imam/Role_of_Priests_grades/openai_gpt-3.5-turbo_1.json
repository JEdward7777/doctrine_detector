The answer effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the various duties priests undertook, emphasizing their significance in offering sacrifices, conducting rituals, maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple, teaching the Law, interceding for the people, overseeing purification rites, and, in some cases, performing judicial functions. This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical role of priests within a Christian worldview. Great job!"
