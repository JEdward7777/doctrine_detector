It effectively addresses the concern of understanding the biblical role of priests by detailing their duties within the religious framework of the Israelite community. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly connecting these responsibilities to the priests' function as mediators between God and the people, emphasizing their crucial role in facilitating the relationship between the community and God. Overall, a well-rounded explanation with room for minor theological depth and clarity enhancement."
