However, the answer falls short in emphasizing the central aspect of proclaiming God's word with authority and accuracy. Additionally, the student should have explored more deeply the unique aspects of prophethood in Christianity, such as pointing towards the fulfillment of prophecies in Jesus Christ. Furthermore, it would have been beneficial to differentiate more clearly between the biblical view of prophets and the Islamic perspective."
