  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the biblical role of prophets, addressing key aspects such as communication of God's will, call to repentance, foretelling and forthtelling, intercessory role, and moral and spiritual leadership. However, there is room for improvement as the answer could have been more focused specifically on the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student effectively connects the Islamic perspective on prophets, which is insightful, but the answer lacks a clear emphasis on the main role of a prophet as speaking God's messages to the people and warning them to turn away from sin and obey God."
