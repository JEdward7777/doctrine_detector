The connection between these roles and their relevance to both biblical and Islamic traditions is also well-made.\n\nHowever, while the response does touch on the idea that prophets often warn people to turn away from sin and obey God, it would have been more directly aligned with the concern of understanding the biblical role of prophets if it had provided a more explicit explanation of this aspect. Nonetheless, the response still demonstrates a good grasp of the overall biblical concept of prophecy.\n\nThe comment: The response provides a thorough exploration of prophetic roles in the Bible, but could be improved by further emphasizing the warning aspect mentioned in the concern's answer."
