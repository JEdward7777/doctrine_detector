  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the biblical understanding of the role of prophets, covering various aspects such as communication of God's will, call to repentance, foretelling, intercessory role, and moral leadership. The student effectively connects the Islamic perspective on honoring biblical prophets as messengers of Allah. However, the response could have included more specific biblical examples or references to support the points made. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical role of prophets and their messages, with room for slight improvement in providing additional depth."
