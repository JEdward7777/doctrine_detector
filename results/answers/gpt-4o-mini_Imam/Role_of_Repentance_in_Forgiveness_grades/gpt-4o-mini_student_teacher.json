  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer that effectively connects repentance and forgiveness in the biblical context. They covered the definitions of repentance and forgiveness, highlighted the reciprocal relationship between the two, and included relevant biblical references. The student's response aligned well with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of sincere repentance for receiving God's forgiveness. However, the reference answer is more concise and directly focuses on the core connection between repentance and forgiveness according to Christian beliefs, which is why the grade is not higher. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic."
