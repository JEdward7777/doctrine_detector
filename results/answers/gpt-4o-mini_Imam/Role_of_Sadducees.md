## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The Sadducees were a significant group in ancient Jewish society, particularly during the Second Temple period. They primarily belonged to the priestly and aristocratic classes and held considerable power and influence. Their main responsibilities in the Jewish Temple system included:

1. **Temple Management**: The Sadducees were tasked with overseeing the operations of the Temple in Jerusalem. This included the administration of sacrifices and other religious rituals.

2. **Sacrificial System**: They played a central role in the sacrificial rites, as they were responsible for offering sacrifices on behalf of the people. This included daily offerings as well as special sacrifices during holidays and festivals.

3. **Interpretation of the Law**: Although they had different views from the Pharisees, the Sadducees were involved in the interpretation of the Torah. They adhered strictly to the written Law and rejected oral traditions, which shaped their approach to religious practices.

4. **Judicial Authority**: The Sadducees had judicial powers and were involved in legal matters, especially those related to the Temple and its activities. They served in the Sanhedrin, which was the supreme council and tribunal in Jewish law.

5. **Political Influence**: Due to their social status and connections, Sadducees often played a role in the political affairs of Judea. Their cooperation with Roman authorities ensured their influence and control over the Temple and its resources.

6. **High Priesthood**: Many high priests during the Second Temple period were Sadducees, and they directly oversaw the spiritual and administrative duties of the Temple.

The Sadducees ultimately had a major role in shaping the religious practices of their time, although their influence waned after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE when the Jewish religious landscape changed significantly.
