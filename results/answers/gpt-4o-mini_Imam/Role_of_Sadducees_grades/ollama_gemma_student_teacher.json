  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Sadducees' responsibilities in the Jewish Temple system. It accurately identifies key duties related to temple management, sacrifices, legal authority, and political influence. The inclusion of historical context and the eventual decline of the Sadducees' influence adds depth to the response. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the Sadducees' interpretation of the Torah and their unique theological beliefs, which are relevant to the specified concern about religious leadership in the time of Jesus."
