  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern of exploring the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus by mentioning the Sadducees' role in temple management and sacrificial system. However, it does not provide adequate information about their broader responsibilities, such as interpretation of the Law, judicial authority, and political influence. Additionally, it does not provide any specific insights or connections to the historical context of Jesus' time. The response is too brief and lacks depth, making it difficult to fully understand the Sadducees' significance in that era.\n\nTo improve this grade, I would suggest providing more details about the Sadducees' roles and responsibilities, as well as exploring how their influence impacted the religious landscape during Jesus' time."
