However, the response could have been improved by delving deeper into the theological significance of Scripture in the context of sharing the Gospel message, particularly emphasizing the authority and sufficiency of God's Word in conveying the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. Additionally, the comparison to Islamic teachings, while informative, slightly detracts from the clarity and focus of the Christian worldview being discussed."
