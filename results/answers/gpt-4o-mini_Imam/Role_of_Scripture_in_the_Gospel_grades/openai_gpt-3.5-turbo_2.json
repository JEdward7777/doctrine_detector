  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and detailed explanation of how Scripture is integrated into the communication of the Gospel based on biblical examples. It effectively demonstrates the significance of using Scripture in evangelism through examples such as the apostles, Jesus, and early Christian communities. The explanation is clear, supported by specific references, and aligns well with the concern of understanding the integration of Scripture in sharing the Gospel from a Christian perspective. Great job overall in addressing the concern within a Christian worldview."
