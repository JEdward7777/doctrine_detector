  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response largely agrees with the given answer, highlighting the significance of witnesses in the New Testament and their role in affirming Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection. The additional points made about the importance of eyewitness testimony, apostolic authority, and the work of the Holy Spirit add depth to the response.\n\nHowever, the given answer is more concise and focused on the call for Christians to share personal experiences of God's work in their lives, which is not fully explored in this response. To strengthen the connection to the concern, the response could be revised to emphasize how the biblical witness can inspire and empower contemporary Christians to share their own faith stories.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a solid foundation on the significance of witnesses in the New Testament, it could benefit from more explicit connections to the concern about Christian witness."
