## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In ancient Israel, the high priest (Kohen Gadol) held a unique and elevated position compared to other priests (Kohanim). His responsibilities were not only ceremonial but also carried significant spiritual and societal implications. Here are some of the key responsibilities that distinguished the high priest:

1. **The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)**: The high priest had the exclusive role of performing the intricate rituals on Yom Kippur, which included entering the Holy of Holies in the Temple to offer sacrifices for the sins of the people and seeking atonement on their behalf. This was a critical moment in the Jewish calendar, emphasizing his unique status.

2. **Intercession for the People**: The high priest acted as a mediator between Allah and the people of Israel. He was responsible for bringing the people's concerns and sins before God, particularly through the sacred rituals and offerings.

3. **The Urim and Thummim**: The high priest wore a special breastplate that contained the Urim and Thummim, objects used for divination and seeking divine guidance. This responsibility was unique to the high priest and involved making decisions on significant matters affecting the community.

4. **Supervision of Other Priests**: The high priest was in charge of overseeing the other priests and ensuring that they performed their duties according to the Torah. He led them in their service and provided guidance and instruction on matters of ritual purity and sacrificial laws.

5. **Maintaining the Sanctity of the Temple**: The high priest had the critical role of ensuring that the Temple rituals were performed in accordance with the Law. He had to maintain the sanctity of the Temple environment, overseeing the offerings and other sacred activities.

6. **Role in Major Festivals**: During significant religious festivals such as Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot, the high priest played a central role in leading the ceremonies and sacrifices, reinforcing his position as a spiritual leader.

7. **Ceremonial Garments**: The high priest had specific garments that signified his unique role, including the ephod, breastplate, and mitre. These garments were not worn by ordinary priests and symbolized his holiness and authority.

8. **Sacrificial Obligations**: While all priests performed sacrifices, the high priest had specific, more significant sacrifices that he was required to offer, particularly for his own sins and those of the entire community.

In summary, the high priest's responsibilities encompassed not only the performance of rituals but also leadership, guidance, and serving as a spiritual intermediary for the people of Israel, highlighting his vital role in their religious life.
