However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies that need to be addressed. The mention of the high priest acting as a mediator between Allah and the people of Israel is incorrect as the Israelites worship the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, not Allah. Additionally, the description of the breastplate containing the Urim and Thummim as objects used for divination is inaccurate; they were more for seeking God's guidance rather than divination. The response could be improved with more emphasis on the spiritual significance and the foreshadowing of the high priest's role in representing Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest in Christian theology."
