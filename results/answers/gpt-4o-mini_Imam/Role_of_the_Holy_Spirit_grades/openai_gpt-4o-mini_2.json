However, from a Christian perspective, the crucial distinction lies in the belief that it is the Holy Spirit living in a born-again believer that empowers them for spiritual growth and produces good fruit in their lives. While the response offers valuable insights into Islamic beliefs and practices, it falls short of directly addressing the concern regarding the role of the Holy Spirit in Christian living."
