## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic teachings, while I can provide insights on the role of the Messiah from a biblical perspective, it's important to highlight that Muslims have their own understanding of the Messiah, specifically in reference to Isa (Jesus) whom they regard as a prophet and messenger of Allah.

In the Christian tradition, the Messiah, often referred to as Jesus Christ, fulfills several roles according to the Bible, which can be summarized as follows:

1. **Savior and Redeemer**: Christians believe that Jesus is the Savior who redeems humanity from sin. This is primarily understood through His crucifixion and resurrection, which are seen as the fulfillment of prophecy for the atonement of sins (John 3:16).

2. **King**: Jesus is often referred to as the King in the New Testament. Revelation 19:16 calls Him "King of Kings and Lord of Lords," emphasizing His divine authority and kingship over all creation.

3. **Prophet**: Jesus is regarded as a prophet who brings God's message to the people. He preached about love, forgiveness, and repentance, fulfilling the role of delivering the Word of God (Luke 4:18-19).

4. **Healer**: The Gospels recount many instances where Jesus performs miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, and performing other signs and wonders. These acts demonstrate His compassion and power (Matthew 9:35).

5. **Teacher/Rabbi**: Jesus served as a teacher, providing guidance on moral and spiritual matters. His teachings, including parables, are at the heart of Christian ethics and belief (Matthew 5-7, the Sermon on the Mount).

6. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**: Christians believe that Jesus fulfills various Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, including those related to His birth, ministry, death, and resurrection. For example, passages in Isaiah are often cited in this context (Isaiah 7:14, Isaiah 53).

7. **Establisher of a New Covenant**: Jesus is perceived as the figure who establishes a new covenant between God and humanity. This is discussed in the context of the Last Supper, where He breaks bread and shares wine, symbolizing His body and blood (Luke 22:20).

From an Islamic perspective, Muslims respect Jesus as the Messiah (Al-Masih) and believe in his miraculous birth and many of his miracles. However, they do not accept the notions of his divinity, crucifixion, or role in atonement as understood in Christianity. Instead, they believe he was a prophet who delivered God's message to the Children of Israel and that he will return in the End Times to restore justice and defeat falsehood.
