  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is comprehensive and well-articulated. It provides a clear and concise explanation of the various roles that the Messiah fulfills according to the Bible, referencing specific passages and concepts. However, it would benefit from a more direct engagement with the provided reference answer, which suggests that the Messiah is a prophet, a priest, and a king, and would start the New Covenant with his people. The student's answer does touch on these aspects but could provide more explicit connection to the reference."
