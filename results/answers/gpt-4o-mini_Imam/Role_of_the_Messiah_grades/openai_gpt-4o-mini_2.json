It aligns well with the given answer that highlights the aspects of the Messiah as a prophet, priest, and king initiating the New Covenant. The explanation is clear, detailed, and offers insights that help believers understand Jesus's mission and authority from a Christian worldview. Great job in addressing the concern effectively."
