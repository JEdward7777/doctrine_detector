However, it is important to note that the instruction regarding manna is found in the Bible, not the Quran. Additionally, the emphasis on the Sabbath as a day of rest should be connected to God's command and example in resting on the seventh day of creation, rather than just as a lesson in the significance of the day. The response could benefit from a clearer focus on the biblical teachings regarding the Sabbath and the provision of manna."
