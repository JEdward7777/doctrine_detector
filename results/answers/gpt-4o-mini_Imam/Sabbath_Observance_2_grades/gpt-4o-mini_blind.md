## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt, the instruction regarding the gathering of manna is found in the Quran as well as in the Bible. According to these scriptures, God provided manna as sustenance for the Israelites.

Specifically, the Israelites were instructed to gather manna every day except for the Sabbath. They could collect a double portion of manna on the sixth day (Friday) to provide for the Sabbath (Saturday). This was to ensure that they would have enough food to eat on the Sabbath, during which they were commanded to rest and refrain from gathering food.

In Exodus 16:22-30, it is stated that on the sixth day, the people gathered twice as much manna, and Moses instructed them not to go out on the Sabbath to gather, emphasizing the importance of the day of rest. In this way, God taught the Israelites the significance of the Sabbath and provided for their needs in accordance with that sacred time.

This practice highlights the importance of both God's provision and the observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.

The answer provides a generally accurate description of how God instructed the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath. However, it is important to note that the instruction regarding manna is found in the Bible, not the Quran. Additionally, the emphasis on the Sabbath as a day of rest should be connected to God's command and example in resting on the seventh day of creation, rather than just as a lesson in the significance of the day. The response could benefit from a clearer focus on the biblical teachings regarding the Sabbath and the provision of manna.
