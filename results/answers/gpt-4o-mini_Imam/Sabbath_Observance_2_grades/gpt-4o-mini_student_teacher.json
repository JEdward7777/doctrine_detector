The inclusion of the Quran in relation to the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and the statement that the instructions are found in both the Quran and the Bible are inaccurate from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the answer lacked specific biblical references that are crucial in understanding the significance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands."
