## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt, the instruction regarding the gathering of manna is found in the Quran as well as in the Bible. According to these scriptures, God provided manna as sustenance for the Israelites.

Specifically, the Israelites were instructed to gather manna every day except for the Sabbath. They could collect a double portion of manna on the sixth day (Friday) to provide for the Sabbath (Saturday). This was to ensure that they would have enough food to eat on the Sabbath, during which they were commanded to rest and refrain from gathering food.

In Exodus 16:22-30, it is stated that on the sixth day, the people gathered twice as much manna, and Moses instructed them not to go out on the Sabbath to gather, emphasizing the importance of the day of rest. In this way, God taught the Israelites the significance of the Sabbath and provided for their needs in accordance with that sacred time.

This practice highlights the importance of both God's provision and the observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately states that the Israelites were instructed to gather twice as much manna the day before the Sabbath, which aligns with the correct answer provided. It also correctly identifies the significance of observing the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship, highlighting God's provision for the Israelites' needs during this sacred time.

However, the response could be improved by providing more context and detail about the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands. While it mentions that God taught the Israelites the significance of the Sabbath through this practice, a stronger emphasis on the biblical commandments regarding the Sabbath would strengthen the response.

Overall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the importance of observing the Sabbath, but could benefit from additional development and biblical support to make its points more convincing.
