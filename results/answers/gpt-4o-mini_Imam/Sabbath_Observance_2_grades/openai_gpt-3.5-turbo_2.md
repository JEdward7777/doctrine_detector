## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt, the instruction regarding the gathering of manna is found in the Quran as well as in the Bible. According to these scriptures, God provided manna as sustenance for the Israelites.

Specifically, the Israelites were instructed to gather manna every day except for the Sabbath. They could collect a double portion of manna on the sixth day (Friday) to provide for the Sabbath (Saturday). This was to ensure that they would have enough food to eat on the Sabbath, during which they were commanded to rest and refrain from gathering food.

In Exodus 16:22-30, it is stated that on the sixth day, the people gathered twice as much manna, and Moses instructed them not to go out on the Sabbath to gather, emphasizing the importance of the day of rest. In this way, God taught the Israelites the significance of the Sabbath and provided for their needs in accordance with that sacred time.

This practice highlights the importance of both God's provision and the observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.

Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands by emphasizing the provision of manna as sustenance and the instruction to gather twice the amount the day before. The connection between God's provision and the observance of Sabbath rest is clearly explained, aligning well with a Christian worldview. However, a deeper reflection on the spiritual significance of the Sabbath observance and its relationship to the Israelites' relationship with God could further enhance the response.
