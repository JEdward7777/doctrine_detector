However, it failed to address the specific requirements of keeping the Sabbath holy according to the commandments given to Moses. The student should have focused more on the biblical understanding and significance of the Sabbath rather than comparing it to Islamic practices. Additionally, there was a lack of depth in discussing the theological implications and meaning behind keeping the Sabbath holy according to the commandments."
