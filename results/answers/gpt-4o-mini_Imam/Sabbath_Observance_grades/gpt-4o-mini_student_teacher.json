  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant information about the concept of Sabbath and the importance of designated days for worship and rest in different religious traditions. However, the student's response did not directly address the Christian viewpoint on keeping the Sabbath holy according to the commandments given to Moses. Additionally, the focus on Islamic teachings, while informative, deviated from the Christian-specific worldview requested in the concern. The answer lacked a clear connection to the Christian understanding of Sabbath observance as outlined in the given reference answer."
