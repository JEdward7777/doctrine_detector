## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Jewish tradition, the Sabbath, or Shabbat, begins at sunset on Friday and lasts until nightfall on Saturday. The exact timing can vary based on geographical location and the time of year, as it is determined by the position of the sun. Traditionally, Shabbat is welcomed with special prayers and the lighting of candles just before sunset on Friday, and it concludes with the Havdalah ceremony, which marks the separation between the sacred time of Shabbat and the regular week. Observant Jews refrain from work and engage in rest, prayer, and family gatherings during this time.

Comment: This response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the timing of the Sabbath according to Jewish tradition, including the significance of starting at sunset on Friday and ending at nightfall on Saturday, as well as the observances associated with Shabbat. Good job overall. However, from a Christian perspective, it would have been beneficial to mention the biblical origins of the Sabbath and its importance in honoring God's commandment to rest on the seventh day.
