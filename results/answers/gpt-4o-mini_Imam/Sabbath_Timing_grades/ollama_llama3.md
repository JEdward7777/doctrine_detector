## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Jewish tradition, the Sabbath, or Shabbat, begins at sunset on Friday and lasts until nightfall on Saturday. The exact timing can vary based on geographical location and the time of year, as it is determined by the position of the sun. Traditionally, Shabbat is welcomed with special prayers and the lighting of candles just before sunset on Friday, and it concludes with the Havdalah ceremony, which marks the separation between the sacred time of Shabbat and the regular week. Observant Jews refrain from work and engage in rest, prayer, and family gatherings during this time.

Comment: The response partially addresses the concern by mentioning that the Sabbath begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday, which aligns with Biblical teaching (Genesis 2:3, Exodus 20:8-11). However, it does not provide specific details about the Jewish tradition of Shabbat, including the exact timing based on geographical location and time of year. Additionally, it fails to mention the significance of welcoming Shabbat with special prayers and lighting candles, as well as concluding it with the Havdalah ceremony. To better address this concern, a more detailed and accurate description of the Jewish tradition surrounding Shabbat would be necessary.
