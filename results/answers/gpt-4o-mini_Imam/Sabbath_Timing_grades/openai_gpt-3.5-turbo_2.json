However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to note that the Biblical teaching specifies that the Sabbath begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday, aligning with the creation account in Genesis where it says, \"And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the first day.\" This timeframe reflects God's established pattern of timekeeping and rest, emphasizing the significance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship to honor the Lord."
