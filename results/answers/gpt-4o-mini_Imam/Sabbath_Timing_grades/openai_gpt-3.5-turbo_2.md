## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Jewish tradition, the Sabbath, or Shabbat, begins at sunset on Friday and lasts until nightfall on Saturday. The exact timing can vary based on geographical location and the time of year, as it is determined by the position of the sun. Traditionally, Shabbat is welcomed with special prayers and the lighting of candles just before sunset on Friday, and it concludes with the Havdalah ceremony, which marks the separation between the sacred time of Shabbat and the regular week. Observant Jews refrain from work and engage in rest, prayer, and family gatherings during this time.

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the timeframe for the observance of the Sabbath based on Jewish tradition. However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to note that the Biblical teaching specifies that the Sabbath begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday, aligning with the creation account in Genesis where it says, "And there was evening, and there was morningâ€”the first day." This timeframe reflects God's established pattern of timekeeping and rest, emphasizing the significance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship to honor the Lord.
