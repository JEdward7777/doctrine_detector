However, from a Christian worldview, sacrificial love as demonstrated by Jesus goes beyond mere acts of kindness, compassion, and service to encompass the ultimate sacrifice of laying down one's life for others, as Jesus did on the cross. The response falls short in explicitly addressing the unique and central aspect of sacrificial love in Christianity, which is rooted in Jesus' atoning death for the forgiveness of sins."
