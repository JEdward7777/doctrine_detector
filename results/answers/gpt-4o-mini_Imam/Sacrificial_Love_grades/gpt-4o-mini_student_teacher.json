  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful exploration of sacrificial love from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing compassion, selflessness, forgiveness, and service. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the essence of God's love as demonstrated by Jesus through His ultimate sacrifice. While the student effectively discusses Islamic teachings on love and selflessness, the answer does not fully address the core Christian principle of sacrificial love exemplified by Jesus. Further integration of how Jesus' sacrificial love reflects God's love and how this should impact personal relationships would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
