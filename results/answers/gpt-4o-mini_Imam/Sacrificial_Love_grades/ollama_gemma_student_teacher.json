  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of sacrificial love as demonstrated by Jesus within the context of Islamic teachings. The essay clearly outlines various ways in which Islamic values and principles align with the idea of loving others sacrificially. However, it would have benefited from a more direct connection to the reference answer, specifically addressing how the Islamic perspective aligns with the Christian understanding of sacrificial love."
