While the essay effectively relates these principles to the Islamic faith, it could have more directly addressed the concern regarding understanding the essence of God's love and its reflection in personal relationships. A more explicit connection to the idea of God's sacrificial love, as exemplified by Jesus in Christianity, and how that should manifest in personal relationships would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
