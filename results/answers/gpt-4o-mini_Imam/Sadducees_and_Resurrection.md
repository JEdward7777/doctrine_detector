## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The Sadducees, a Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, held a distinctive belief regarding the resurrection of the dead. They did not believe in the resurrection, which is explicitly stated in the Gospels where Jesus dialogues with them (e.g., Matthew 22:23). The Sadducees also rejected other concepts such as the existence of angels and spirits, largely adhering to a more literal interpretation of the Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible).

In contrast, Christian teaching strongly affirms the resurrection of the dead, centering on the resurrection of Jesus Christ as a foundational event in Christianity. According to Christian doctrine, Jesusâ€™ resurrection is seen as a promise of eternal life for all believers, which is rooted in New Testament scriptures (e.g., 1 Corinthians 15:20-22).

Thus, the core contrast lies in the Sadducees' denial of any resurrection after death and their limited theological scope compared to Christianity's broader eschatological views, including both the resurrection of Christ and the hope of resurrection for believers. This divergence reflects fundamental differences in beliefs about life after death and the nature of God's revelation and promises.
