  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer explaining the beliefs of the Sadducees and contrasting it with Christian teaching on resurrection. They accurately highlighted the key differences and implications for faith. However, there was some extra detail and explanation beyond the reference answer, which is why the grade is slightly lower. Overall, a well-written response demonstrating a good understanding of the topic."
