  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe response effectively explores the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in Samson's story, highlighting how his adherence to the Nazirite vow linked him to God's power. The writer skillfully draws parallels between the biblical narrative and Islamic teachings, showcasing a deep understanding of both traditions.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the implications of Samson's story for modern-day Christians and Muslims. While the writer provides some insightful connections, the discussion feels somewhat surface-level. A more nuanced exploration of how these themes play out in contemporary contexts would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong and well-organized response that effectively explores the concern and demonstrates a high level of understanding and insight into both biblical and Islamic traditions."
