However, the inclusion of Islam as a comparison detracts from the clarity and focus of the response within a Christian worldview. The sanctification process should be explained and understood solely within the context of Christian theology, without drawing comparisons or parallels to other faith traditions. Additionally, the response could have emphasized more on the necessity of grace and faith in Christ for sanctification, which are fundamental aspects of Christian belief."
