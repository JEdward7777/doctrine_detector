  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the sanctification process for believers in Jesus, including key points such as initial sanctification, progressive sanctification, the role of the Holy Spirit, community and accountability, and striving towards perfection. However, the student strays from the Christian worldview by attempting to draw parallels between Christianity and Islam regarding sanctification. It is important to maintain a distinct Christian perspective when discussing theological concepts such as sanctification. The response lacks a clear emphasis on the central role of faith in the process of sanctification as outlined in the reference answer."
