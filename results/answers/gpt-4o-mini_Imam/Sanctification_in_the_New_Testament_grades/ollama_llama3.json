The author also recognizes the role of the Holy Spirit and the importance of community and accountability in this process.\n\nHowever, the response does not fully address the concern of recognizing the role of faith in the process of sanctification. While it is mentioned that believers are viewed as sanctified upon their faith in Jesus, the subsequent points focus more on the ongoing process of growth in holiness and spiritual maturity rather than explicitly highlighting the central role of faith.\n\nTo improve, the response could provide a clearer explanation of how faith plays a crucial part in this process, perhaps citing specific biblical passages that emphasize the importance of faith for sanctification."
