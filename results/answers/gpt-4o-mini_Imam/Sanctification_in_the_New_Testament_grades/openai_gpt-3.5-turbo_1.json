It goes into detail about the process of sanctification in the New Testament, highlighting the importance of faith, growth, the Holy Spirit, community, and the goal of spiritual maturity. The comparison with Islam adds depth to the discussion, showing a good understanding of similarities and differences in the two faith traditions. Well done!"
