It then builds upon this by discussing the ongoing journey of growth in holiness and spiritual maturity for believers, highlighting the importance of faith in Jesus throughout the process. The incorporation of key concepts such as progressive sanctification, the role of the Holy Spirit, community and accountability, and the goal of perfection align well with the concern raised and provide a comprehensive understanding of sanctification within a Christian worldview."
