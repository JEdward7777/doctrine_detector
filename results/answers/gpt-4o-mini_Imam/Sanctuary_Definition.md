## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Bible, the term "sanctuary" generally refers to a sacred or holy place dedicated to worship and the presence of God. In the Old Testament, the sanctuary often denotes the Tabernacle, which was a portable dwelling place for the Divine Presence among the Israelites during their Exodus from Egypt. The term also applies to the Temple in Jerusalem, especially the inner sanctum known as the Most Holy Place (or Holy of Holies), where the Ark of the Covenant was kept and where God's presence was believed to dwell.

The concept of a sanctuary extends to the idea of safety and refuge. In biblical times, cities of refuge were designated places where individuals could seek protection, particularly from retaliation in cases of manslaughter. This dual meaning of "sanctuary" reflects both the physical space of worship and the metaphorical space of divine protection and mercy.

While these interpretations come from the Judeo-Christian tradition, in Islamic understanding, the significance of a sacred place or sanctuary also exists, notably in regard to the Kaaba in Mecca, which holds great significance as a place for worship and the oneness of God (Tawhid). Each tradition places immense importance on the idea of sacred spaces where believers can connect with the divine.
