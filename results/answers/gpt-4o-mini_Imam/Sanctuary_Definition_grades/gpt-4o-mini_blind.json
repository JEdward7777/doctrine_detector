The mention of the different traditions (Judeo-Christian and Islamic) adds a broader perspective. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological significance of sanctuaries within the Bible and how they point to the ultimate sanctuary found in Christ. Additionally, while acknowledging other traditions is informative, it is essential to focus primarily on the Christian perspective when discussing biblical concepts."
