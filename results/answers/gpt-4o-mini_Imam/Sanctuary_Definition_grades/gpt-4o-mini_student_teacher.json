  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer explaining the meaning and significance of the term \"sanctuary\" in the Bible. They correctly outlined the concept of sanctuary as a sacred or holy place dedicated to worship and the presence of God, mentioning key locations like the Tabernacle and the Temple in Jerusalem. Additionally, they touched on the idea of sanctuary as a place of safety and refuge, including the concept of cities of refuge. The student also made a thoughtful comparison with Islamic understanding of sacred spaces. While their response was detailed and insightful, the grade is slightly lower than perfect as it contained some extraneous information not directly related to the Biblical understanding of sanctuary."
