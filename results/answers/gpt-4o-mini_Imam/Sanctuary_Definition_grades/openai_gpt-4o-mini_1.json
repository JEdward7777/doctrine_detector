It also touches upon the concept of sanctuary as a place of protection and refuge, mirroring the dual meaning found in the Bible. The inclusion of the term's significance in Islamic understanding adds a comparative perspective. The response could have been enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications and symbolism associated with the sanctuary in Christianity."
