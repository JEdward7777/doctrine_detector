In the Old Testament, particularly in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, God described the sanctuary as a dwelling place among His people, the Israelites. The sanctuary, known as the Tabernacle, was a portable structure that served as a holy space where God would meet with His people.

1. **Divine Presence**: God indicated that He would dwell among the Israelites (Exodus 25:8). The Tabernacle was a physical representation of God’s presence. The cloud by day and fire by night symbolized His glory resting in the sanctuary (Exodus 40:34-38).

2. **Covenant Relationship**: The sanctuary was central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It was where offerings and sacrifices were made, symbolizing atonement for sin and the people's commitment to God (Leviticus 1-7).

3. **Holiness**: The sanctuary was a holy place (Leviticus 16:16) where strict guidelines were established to maintain its sanctity. God’s holiness required that the people approach Him with reverence and purity.

4. **Worship and Fellowship**: The sanctuary facilitated worship and fellowship between God and His people. It was the place for communal worship, celebrations, and festivals, reinforcing the communal identity and faith of the Israelites (Deuteronomy 12:5-7).

5. **Priestly Mediation**: The sanctuary was served by priests who acted as mediators between God and the people. They performed sacrifices and officiated religious rituals, emphasizing the importance of a dedicated and holy lineage for approaching God's presence (Exodus 28-29).

In summary, the sanctuary in the Old Testament is a profound symbol of God’s desire to live in relationship with His people, embodying themes of holiness, covenant, and community worship.
