  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer outlining the various aspects of the sanctuary in relation to God and His people in the Old Testament. They covered key points such as divine presence, covenant relationship, holiness, worship, fellowship, and priestly mediation. The provided references from Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers support their explanation well. However, the concern specifically highlighted the importance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people, which the student addressed only partially. They could have emphasized more on the sanctuary being a safe place for the Israelites, as mentioned in the reference answer."
