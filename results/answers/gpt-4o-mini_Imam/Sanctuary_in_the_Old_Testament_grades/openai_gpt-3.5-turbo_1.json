The integration of relevant biblical references and themes such as divine presence, covenant relationship, holiness, worship, and priestly mediation demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian worldview and the sanctuary's importance in fostering a relationship with God. Great job in addressing the concern with a well-supported explanation."
