## [Answer](../Satan_s_Fate.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, the fate of Satan (Iblis) and his followers is clearly depicted in the Qur'an and Hadith. Satan, who refused to bow to Adam out of pride, was cast out of Paradise and became an avowed enemy to humanity. His goal is to lead people astray from the path of righteousness.

According to the Qur'an, Iblis and his followers (including those who align with him in disbelief) will ultimately face severe punishment in Hell (Jahannam). Several verses detail this fate. For instance, in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:168), it is stated that those who follow Satan will find themselves in a state of misery and regret. Surah Al-Aâ€™raf (7:36-38) also refers to the censure awaiting those who reject faith and follow the path of Iblis.

In Surah Al-Muddaththir (74:26-30), the description of Hell includes a mention of the punishments that await those who follow Iblis. It conveys that they will be cast into the fire and experience intense suffering.

Additionally, it is emphasized in various hadiths that on the Day of Judgment, Iblis will acknowledge his role in misleading humanity but will have no power to save himself or his followers from the consequences of their actions. The followers of Iblis will express regret and wish they had not listened to him.

Overall, the Islamic perspective is that the fate of Satan and his followers is one of eternal punishment, reflecting the consequences of rejecting God's guidance and leading others away from the truth.
