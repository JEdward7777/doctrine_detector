In the context of intercession, several Bible verses highlight the significance of praying for others, which can offer insights into this practice. Here are some key verses:

1. **1 Timothy 2:1-2**: "I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness."

2. **James 5:16**: "Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective."

3. **Job 42:10**: "After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before." This verse demonstrates the impact of intercession on others’ lives.

4. **Luke 22:32**: Jesus said to Peter, "But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail." This indicates the importance of praying for one another in times of trials.

5. **Romans 8:26-27**: "In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans."

These verses collectively illustrate the practice of interceding for others as a vital aspect of faith, encouraging believers to support one another through prayer. While the Bible is a different scripture than the Quran, both emphasize the importance of community and praying for one another. In Islam, the concept of making dua (supplication) for others is also highly regarded, showcasing the shared understanding of intercession and the importance of compassion within communities.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a solid overview of key Bible verses related to intercession and effectively highlighted the significance of praying for others based on these passages. The mention of the Quran and Islamic practices, while informative from a comparative religion perspective, was not necessary in answering the question focused on insights from the Bible. The student could have further deepened the analysis by exploring the theological implications and application of intercession within a Christian worldview.
