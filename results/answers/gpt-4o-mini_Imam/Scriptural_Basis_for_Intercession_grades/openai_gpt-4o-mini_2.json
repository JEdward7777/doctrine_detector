The student effectively incorporates key verses that highlight the importance of praying for others and draws connections between intercession and faith. However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern by encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. Additionally, the comparison with Islam, while informative, slightly detracts from the focus on the Christian perspective."
