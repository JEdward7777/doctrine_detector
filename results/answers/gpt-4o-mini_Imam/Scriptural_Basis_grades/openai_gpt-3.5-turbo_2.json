  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the theological concept of propitiation with relevant biblical references, specifically citing key verses that highlight Jesus as the propitiation for our sins. The analysis demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept within Christian theology and supports it with appropriate scriptural evidence. The explanation is concise and focused, addressing the concern of connecting the concept with biblical references for deeper understanding. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a bit more depth in the explanation or further explore the implications of propitiation in Christian belief."
