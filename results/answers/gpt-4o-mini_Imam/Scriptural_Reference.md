## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Bible, the concept of the 'world' often refers to the worldly values, systems, and behaviors that are contrary to the teachings of God and can draw believers away from their faith. Here are some key biblical passages that address this concept in relation to believers:

1. **John 15:18-19 (NIV)**: "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you." 
   - This passage highlights the distinction between believers and the world, emphasizing that those who follow Christ are set apart from worldly values.

2. **Romans 12:2 (NIV)**: "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."
   - Here, Paul encourages believers to resist conforming to worldly standards and instead seek transformation through God's guidance.

3. **1 John 2:15-17 (NIV)**: "Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. For everything in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—comes not from the Father but from the world. The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives forever."
   - This passage makes a clear distinction between love for the world and love for God, warning against the transient nature of worldly desires.

4. **James 4:4 (NIV)**: "You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God."
   - James admonishes believers to consider the implications of aligning themselves with worldly values and emphasizes loyalty to God.

5. **Colossians 3:2 (NIV)**: "Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth."
   - This verse encourages believers to focus on spiritual matters rather than being preoccupied with worldly concerns.

These passages collectively reflect a common theme in the Bible: the call for believers to maintain a distinct identity that is not rooted in the world’s values, instead prioritizing their relationship with God.
