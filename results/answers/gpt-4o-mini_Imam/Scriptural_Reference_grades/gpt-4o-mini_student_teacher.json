  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of key biblical passages addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers. They have effectively highlighted the importance of maintaining a distinct identity as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values. However, the student could improve their grade by incorporating the additional references provided in the teacher's answer to further enhance the breadth of biblical insight on this topic."
