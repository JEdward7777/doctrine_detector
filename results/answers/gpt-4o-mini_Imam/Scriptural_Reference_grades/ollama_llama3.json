The selected passages, such as John 15:18-19, Romans 12:2, 1 John 2:15-17, James 4:4, and Colossians 3:2, collectively convey a call for believers to prioritize their relationship with God and resist conformity to the world.\n\nWhile the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the biblical passages to the concern of navigating life as a believer in a world with ungodly values, it still provides a solid foundation for understanding this critical aspect of Christian living."
