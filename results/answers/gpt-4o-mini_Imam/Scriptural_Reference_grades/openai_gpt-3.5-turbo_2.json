It effectively utilized relevant passages such as John 15:18-19, Romans 12:2, 1 John 2:15-17, James 4:4, and Colossians 3:2 to support the discussion. The integration of these passages demonstrates a solid understanding of how Christians should navigate life in a world characterized by ungodly values. Great use of biblical references and interpretation."
