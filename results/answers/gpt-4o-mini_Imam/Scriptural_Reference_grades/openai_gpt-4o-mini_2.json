The references to specific Scriptures and their interpretations align well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a distinct identity separate from worldly values. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps provide a bit more discussion on how these passages specifically guide believers in interacting with and responding to ungodly values in the world."
