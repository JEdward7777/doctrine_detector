  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student correctly identifies some biblical passages related to the Day of Judgment, they incorrectly suggest that the concept is more prominently articulated in Islamic texts. This downplays the significance of the biblical teaching on judgment, which is foundational in Christian theology. The response lacks a clear emphasis on the uniqueness of Christian beliefs regarding judgment and could benefit from a stronger focus on the biblical perspective. Additionally, the comparison to Islamic teachings could be seen as minimizing the distinctiveness of Christian doctrine. More emphasis on the biblical passages and their implications for Christian faith would improve the grade."
