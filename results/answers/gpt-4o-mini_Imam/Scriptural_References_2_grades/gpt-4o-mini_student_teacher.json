  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation and cited relevant biblical passages to support the concept of the Day of Judgment. However, the student's answer did not directly align with the teacher's reference answer, which focused on specific passages. It would have been more effective if the student had included the given key passages along with the additional references. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept but falls short in directly addressing the concern of reinforcing scriptural basis as requested."
