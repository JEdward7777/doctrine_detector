## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The concept of the Day of Judgment is present in both the Bible and the Qur'an, although it is more prominently articulated in Islamic texts. In the Bible, various passages emphasize the idea of a final judgment where individuals will be held accountable for their actions. Here are a few passages that refer to this concept:

1. **Matthew 25:31-46**: This passage speaks about the Son of Man coming in His glory and separating the sheep from the goats based on their actions, notably their treatment of others. It highlights accountability and the consequences of one's deeds.

2. **2 Corinthians 5:10**: The Apostle Paul writes, “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.” This emphasizes the idea of personal judgment.

3. **Revelation 20:11-15**: This passage describes the Great White Throne Judgment, where the dead are judged according to their works as recorded in the books. This is a vivid depiction of ultimate accountability at the end of time.

4. **Ecclesiastes 12:14**: In this verse, it is stated, "For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil." It reinforces the idea that nothing escapes God's knowledge and judgment.

5. **Romans 14:10-12**: Here, Paul mentions that we will all stand before the judgment seat of God and that each of us will give an account of ourselves to God, showcasing the personal nature of judgment.

These passages reflect similar themes found in Islamic teachings about the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah), highlighting accountability, the weighing of deeds, and the eternal consequences that follow. In both religious traditions, the Day of Judgment serves as a powerful reminder of the moral and ethical responsibilities incumbent upon individuals.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response provides a thorough and accurate discussion of biblical passages related to judgment, citing five specific passages that emphasize accountability, personal responsibility, and ultimate consequences. The inclusion of these passages from various books (Matthew, Corinthians, Revelation, Ecclesiastes, and Romans) demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural basis for beliefs about judgment.

However, the response does not directly address the concern of deepening the understanding of scripture related to judgment or specifically addressing the key passages mentioned in the answer. While it does mention similar themes found in Islamic teachings about the Day of Judgment, this is not directly relevant to the concern at hand.

To improve, the response could have more explicitly connected the biblical passages cited to the concern of deepening the understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforced the scriptural basis for beliefs.
