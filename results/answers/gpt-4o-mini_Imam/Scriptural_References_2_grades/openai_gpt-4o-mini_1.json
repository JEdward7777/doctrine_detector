  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of key passages related to judgment in the Bible, demonstrating a strong understanding of the scriptural basis for beliefs about the Day of Judgment. The incorporation of additional passages and explanations contributes significantly to the depth of understanding and reinforces the scriptural basis for these beliefs. The response effectively addresses the concern by expanding upon the original answer and providing a well-rounded perspective on the concept of judgment. Great job overall!"
