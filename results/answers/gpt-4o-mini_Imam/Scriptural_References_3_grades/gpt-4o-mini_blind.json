  "grade_comment": "Grade: 35\n\nComment: The response does not accurately represent a Christian perspective on the verses in question. The student's interpretation from a Muslim perspective is not relevant to grading a Christian response. The importance of repentance, transformation, and the contrast between external righteousness and internal corruption should have been emphasized. The emphasis on sincerity and purity aligns with Christian teachings, but the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus Christ and the need for a heart transformation by the Holy Spirit were missed. The response lacks doctrinal correctness in explaining the nature of iniquity as presented in Matthew 23:27-28."
