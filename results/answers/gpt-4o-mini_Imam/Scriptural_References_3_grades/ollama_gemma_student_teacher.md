## Question [Scriptural References 3](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_3.md)
What do passages like Matthew 23:27-28 teach us about the nature of iniquity?

## Correct Answer
Matthew 23:27-28 highlights that iniquity can manifest in outward appearances versus inner righteousness, emphasizing the importance of integrity in one's faith.

## Stated Concern
This serves as a reminder for Christians to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
Matthew 23:27-28 states: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.”

From a Muslim perspective, these verses highlight a significant theme found in many religious texts: the importance of inner purity and sincerity. The imagery of whitewashed tombs serves to illustrate the contrast between outward appearance and inner reality. This resonates with the Islamic principles of *niyyah* (intention) and *ikhlaas* (sincerity). 

Iniquity, as presented in these verses, can be understood as a state where a person's actions do not align with their inner faith and integrity. It teaches us that it is not enough to merely appear righteous or to perform good deeds outwardly; one must cultivate genuineness and purity of heart.

Islam emphasizes that sincere worship and righteous actions must stem from a pure heart and intention, echoing the sentiment in these verses. Falsehood, hypocrisy, and insincerity are seen as forms of iniquity that can corrupt both the individual and the community.

In conclusion, Matthew 23:27-28 reflects the broader theological theme found in Islam—that one's faith and actions must be authentically aligned and that true righteousness is determined by the state of the heart and intentions, not merely by outward appearances.
