However, the perspective presented is from Islam and lacks direct application to a Christian worldview. While the concepts of inner purity and sincerity are universal, the response could have connected these themes more explicitly to the Christian call for genuine holiness and integrity. Further integration of Christian beliefs and teachings would strengthen the analysis."
