However, the analysis mainly focuses on Islamic principles and teachings rather than directly addressing the concern raised about pursuing genuine holiness in Christianity. The response effectively highlights the need for aligning faith with actions and the significance of sincerity, but it could have delved deeper into how Christians should heed the warning against outward righteousness devoid of inner integrity. More direct connections to Christian beliefs and practices would have strengthened the response."
