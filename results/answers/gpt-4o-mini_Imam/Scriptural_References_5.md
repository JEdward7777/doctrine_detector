## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the New Testament, there are several verses that indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades from a more neutral place for the dead to one associated with the unrighteous. Here are some key verses that reflect this change in perception:

1. **Luke 16:19-31** - This passage describes the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. In this parable, Hades is depicted as a place of torment for the rich man, who is separated from Lazarus, who is comforted in Abraham’s bosom. This suggests a division within Hades, indicating it is not a neutral realm but rather a place where the righteous and unrighteous experience contrasting fates.

2. **Matthew 11:23** - In this verse, Jesus mentions Capernaum saying, “And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades.” This statement suggests Hades is a place of disgrace or punishment, especially for those who do not repent.

3. **Revelation 20:13-14** - This passage describes the final judgment, where Hades is depicted as giving up the dead that were in it, and then Hades itself is thrown into the lake of fire. This indicates a transformation of Hades from its prior role into a location associated with ultimate judgment and condemnation.

4. **Acts 2:27, 31** - In Peter’s sermon at Pentecost, he cites Psalm 16 to affirm that God would not abandon Christ to Hades. This reinforces the idea that Hades is connected with death and separation from God but does not denote a final state for the righteous (in the case of Jesus).

These verses illustrate a development in the understanding of Hades in the New Testament as a place not merely to house the dead but as a realm that signifies judgment and separation based on one's righteousness or unrighteousness.
