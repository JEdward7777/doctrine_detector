  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the shift in understanding of Hades in the New Testament, supported by relevant verses. The connections made between each verse and the concept of Hades as a place associated with the unrighteous are well articulated and supported by sound reasoning. However, to enhance the answer, the student could have elaborated more on the historical and cultural context surrounding the belief in Hades during the time of the New Testament, providing a deeper understanding of the significance of this shift in perception. Nevertheless, the analysis and scriptural references demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic."
