  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the New Testament verses that indicate the shift in understanding of Hades from a neutral place to a location associated with the unrighteous. They cited relevant passages and explained how each one contributes to this shift. However, they could have more directly addressed the teacher's reference answer by specifically mentioning Luke 16:23 and Luke 23:43 as primary examples of this shift in understanding. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
