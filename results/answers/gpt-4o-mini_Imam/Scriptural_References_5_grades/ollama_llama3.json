  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the shift in understanding of Hades from neutral to associated with the unrighteous, citing four relevant verses from the New Testament. The explanation of each verse is clear and concise, showing a good grasp of the scriptural evidence.\n\nHowever, the response could have been more comprehensive by including more verses or exploring the implications of this shift for Christian eschatology in greater depth. Additionally, while the answer provided does mention some of the same verses, it only scratches the surface of the development in understanding Hades throughout the New Testament, and the response would have benefited from a more detailed analysis.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good foundation of biblical knowledge and provides a clear explanation of the shift in understanding Hades, but could have gone further to explore the topic in greater depth."
