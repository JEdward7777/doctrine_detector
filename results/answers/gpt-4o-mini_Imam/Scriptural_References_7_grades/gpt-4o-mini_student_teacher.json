  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student made a commendable effort in discussing the verses from both a Christian and Islamic perspective. However, the student's answer drifted too far from the focus on connecting biblical principles of humility and exaltation in the life of believers. The response included valuable insights but lacked a thorough analysis of the specific concern provided. The inclusion of an Islamic perspective, while enriching, could have been more succinct and directly related to the Christian worldview in addressing the given question."
