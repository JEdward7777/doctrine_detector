  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that effectively analyzes the verses from 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11 in the context of exaltation within the Christian faith. The student clearly demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological concepts and provides relevant supporting arguments from both the Christian and Islamic perspectives. The inclusion of parallels between the two faiths adds an interesting dimension to the discussion."
