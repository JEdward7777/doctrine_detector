  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and respectful answer that integrated Christian teachings on being blameless with a broader ethical perspective. They correctly referenced verses that support the concept of blamelessness and explained how they guide a Christian's life. The student also highlighted the importance of moral integrity, community influence, and self-reflection based on the scriptural references provided. The only improvement would be to directly reference the key verses mentioned by the teacher for a more direct alignment with the question."
