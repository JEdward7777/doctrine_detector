  "grade_comment": "I would rate this response a 95.\n\nThe student accurately identifies the book of Genesis as the source of the reference to God as \"Almighty\" in relation to Abraham. They correctly cite Genesis 17:1, where God reveals Himself to Abraham as \"El Shaddai,\" emphasizing His power and sovereignty in the context of the covenant. The explanation provided is clear and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical reference. Additionally, the offer for further questions shows willingness to engage with the topic beyond the initial response.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written and doctrinally sound answer that effectively addresses the question asked."
