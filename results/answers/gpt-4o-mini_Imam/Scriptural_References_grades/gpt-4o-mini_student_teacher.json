  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 95. The student not only correctly identified the book of the Bible (Genesis) and the specific reference (Genesis 17:1) but also provided additional context and explanation regarding the significance of God being referred to as \"Almighty\" in relation to Abraham. This depth of understanding and willingness to engage with the topic shows a good grasp of biblical knowledge and a desire to delve deeper into understanding Scripture and God's promises. However, the response could be improved by directly stating that Genesis is the book in which the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham is found, without the additional mentions of related subjects or questions."
