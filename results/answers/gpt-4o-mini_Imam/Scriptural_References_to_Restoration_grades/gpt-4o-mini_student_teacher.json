They demonstrated a solid understanding of finding scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey by selecting verses that highlight God's ability to restore, heal, and renew His people. The inclusion of verses like Psalm 23:3, Isaiah 61:1-3, Joel 2:25-26, Jeremiah 30:17, and 2 Corinthians 5:17 effectively conveyed the message of restoration and hope. The student's answer was well thought out, comprehensive, and aligned well with the concern provided. Great job!"
