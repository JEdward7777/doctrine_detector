  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student has provided a thorough explanation of the concept of a 'seared' conscience from an Islamic perspective, the answer lacks alignment with a Christian worldview, which is the specified concern for grading. The response should have focused on Christian beliefs and scriptures related to a seared conscience, providing insights from a biblical perspective. The student demonstrated good knowledge and critical thinking, but the response needed to be grounded in a Christian framework to address the concern effectively."
