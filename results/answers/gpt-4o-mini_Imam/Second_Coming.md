## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds is often interpreted in Christian theology as a reference to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. In a Muslim context, it's essential to acknowledge that Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered a prophet and the Messiah in Islam. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus will indeed return before the Day of Judgment, where he will play a crucial role in establishing justice and upholding the truth.

For believers, Jesus' return carries significant implications:

1. **Symbol of Hope and Justice:** His return is seen as a time when justice will be restored, and believers can have hope that oppression and falsehood will be defeated.

2. **Affirmation of Faith:** Believers are encouraged to maintain their faith and practice righteousness in anticipation of this significant event. It serves as a reminder to stay steadfast in their beliefs and actions.

3. **Call to Unity:** Jesus’ return can be perceived as a unifying event for believers, emphasizing common faith and values in the worship of one God. It highlights the importance of brotherhood and sisterhood among Muslims and people of faith.

4. **Preparation for Accountability:** The return of Jesus reminds believers of the transient nature of this world and the reality of the hereafter. It encourages self-reflection, repentance, and preparation for their own accountability before God.

In summary, while the specifics may differ between Christian and Islamic interpretations, the return of Jesus as a significant event is universally regarded as a moment for hope, unity, and moral vigilance for believers in both faith traditions.
