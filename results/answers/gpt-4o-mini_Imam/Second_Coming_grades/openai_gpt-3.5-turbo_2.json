It effectively highlights the significance of Jesus' return in terms of hope, justice, faith, unity, and accountability, demonstrating a strong understanding of the implications within a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly tie the concept of Jesus' return as the 'Son of Man' back to Christian eschatology and the broader theological framework of His role in the Second Coming."
