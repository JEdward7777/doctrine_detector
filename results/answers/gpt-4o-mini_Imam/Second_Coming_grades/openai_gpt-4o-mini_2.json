It effectively addresses the concern by capturing the essence of Christian hope and eschatology related to the Second Coming of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.' The analysis is well-rounded and demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological significance of this event to believers in both faith traditions. Great job!"
