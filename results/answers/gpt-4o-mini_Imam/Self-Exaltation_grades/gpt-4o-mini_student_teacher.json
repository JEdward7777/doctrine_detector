  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings, drawing parallels with Islamic teachings. However, the answer contains excessive focus on similarities with Islamic perspectives rather than exclusively addressing the biblical teachings. While the response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride, it lacks conciseness and clarity in solely discussing the biblical perspective, leading to a slightly lower grade."
