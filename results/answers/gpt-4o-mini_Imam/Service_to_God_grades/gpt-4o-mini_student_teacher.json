  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student addressed the concern by providing actionable ways for Christians to serve God in their ministry, including spreading the Gospel, engaging in acts of service, prayer and worship, teaching and discipleship, social justice, and healthcare/education. The student's response was comprehensive and insightful, connecting the concept of serving God to various practical applications within Christian ministry. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the core biblical principles mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Furthermore, while the student made an effort to bridge similarities between Christianity and Islam, a more focused Christian-specific approach would have enhanced the response."
