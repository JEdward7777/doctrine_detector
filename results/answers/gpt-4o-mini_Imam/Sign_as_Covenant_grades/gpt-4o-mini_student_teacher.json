  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough comparison between the Biblical and Islamic perspectives on divine mercy and covenants, which shows a good understanding of the topic. However, the student deviated from the Christian-specific worldview by primarily focusing on the Islamic perspective rather than emphasizing the significance of the rainbow as a sign of God's covenant in Genesis, as instructed. The answer would have been stronger if it had stayed more focused on the Christian interpretation of the rainbow as a symbol of God's promise and faithfulness."
