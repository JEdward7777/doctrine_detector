In the context of the Qur'an, the concept of a covenant is also recognized, although the specific story of Noah and the rainbow as a sign of God's promise is more elaborated in the Bible, notably in the book of Genesis.

In Genesis 9:12-17, after the flood, God establishes a covenant with Noah and his descendants, promising never to destroy the earth by flood again. The rainbow is presented as a sign of this covenant. When God sees the rainbow in the clouds, it serves as a reminder of His promise to humanity. This sign not only symbolizes God's mercy and grace but also signifies a divine reassurance that He will not allow such destruction to happen again.

From an Islamic perspective, while we may not find the exact narrative of the rainbow in the Qur'an, the overarching themes of divine mercy, the importance of covenants (known as "ahd" in Arabic), and God's promises to His creations are present. Allah's mercy is a core belief in Islam, and the story of Noah (Nuh) is acknowledged, highlighting both the consequences of disbelief and the mercy extended to the faithful.

In summary, the rainbow in the Biblical context serves as a powerful symbol of God's mercy and His unwavering promise to humanity, reminding us of His faithfulness and the hope which follows trials. Muslims value the lesson of faith and God's promises, reflecting on the importance of obedience to His commands and the mercy He offers to those who believe.
