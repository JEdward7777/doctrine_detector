  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The response provides a thorough and well-articulated explanation of the significance of altars in ancient Israelite worship. It correctly highlights the various roles that altars played in facilitating divine encounter, sacrifice, covenant remembrance, community gathering, cultural expression, and instruction in the law. The answer effectively connects these aspects to the religious, communal, and cultural dimensions of Israelite faith. It would have been even stronger with a clearer emphasis on the importance of sacrificial aspects for atonement and divine favor. Additionally, integrating scriptural references or examples of altars from the Old Testament could have enriched the response. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated."
