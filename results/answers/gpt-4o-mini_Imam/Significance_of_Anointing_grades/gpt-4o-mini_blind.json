  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is an excellent response that demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of anointing in the Old Testament context of priests, kings, and prophets. The student effectively highlights the key aspects such as divine selection, empowerment by the Holy Spirit, purity, covenantal significance, and the foreshadowing of Christ as the ultimate Anointed One. The use of relevant scriptural references adds depth to the explanation. Well done."
