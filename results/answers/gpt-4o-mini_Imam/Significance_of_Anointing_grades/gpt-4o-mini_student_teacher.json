  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-explained analysis of the significance of anointing in the context of Old Testament priests, kings, and prophets. They accurately cover various aspects such as divine selection and authority, empowerment by the Holy Spirit, symbol of purity and holiness, covenantal significance, and foreshadowing of the Messiah. The student effectively illustrates the importance of anointing in biblical leadership roles with biblical references and theological insights. The only minor improvement would be to directly address the teacher's reference answer to show a clearer alignment with the specified concern."
