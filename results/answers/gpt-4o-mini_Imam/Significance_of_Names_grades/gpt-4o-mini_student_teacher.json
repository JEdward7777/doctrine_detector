  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student effectively discusses various aspects related to the significance of 'Shaddai' being translated as a title rather than a name, they missed the primary point of emphasizing God's attributes and personal relationship. The student made an insightful connection with Islamic theology, but they could have delved deeper into the distinct Christian understanding of God's character and relational aspect. Overall, it shows a good understanding but lacks emphasis on the key concern provided."
