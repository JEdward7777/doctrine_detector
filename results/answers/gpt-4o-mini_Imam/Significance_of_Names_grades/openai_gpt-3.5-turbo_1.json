  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does a good job of exploring the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title in emphasizing God's attributes of omnipotence and strength, aligning well with the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. The analysis also effectively draws parallels with Islamic theology, showcasing a broader understanding of interfaith perspectives. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included a more explicit connection to Christian-specific beliefs and teachings, rather than focusing solely on similarities with Islam. Additionally, integrating scriptural references or quotations could have further enriched the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
