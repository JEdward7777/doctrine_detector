  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive exploration of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title in relation to God's attributes and relational aspect. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how this translation choice emphasizes God's power and sovereignty, which are essential aspects of His character. Additionally, the response draws parallels and distinctions between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on God's nature, enriching the discussion. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more explicit references to Christian Scripture or theology to strengthen the Christian-specific worldview in the explanation."
