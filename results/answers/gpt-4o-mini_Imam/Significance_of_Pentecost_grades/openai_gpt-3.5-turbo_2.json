It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how the Holy Spirit played a crucial role in this event and its impact on the early Christian Church. The integration of Biblical references further strengthens the argument and demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview. The response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of the Holy Spirit's empowerment in the lives of believers, but overall, it offers a comprehensive and insightful perspective."
