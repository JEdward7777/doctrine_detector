The student demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context and effectively connects it to the socio-political dynamics of that era. The answer is well-supported, coherent, and aligns with a Christian worldview by acknowledging the role of tetrarchs like Herod Antipas in biblical events. Great job overall."
