  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The response provides a detailed explanation of the role of signs and miracles in Islamic theology, which is insightful. However, the question specifically asked about the Christian perspective on signs and miracles as seen in Jesus and the apostles, not in Islam. The grade is lower because the response does not directly address the Christian worldview regarding signs and miracles, thus missing the doctrinal accuracy required in the context of the question posed."
