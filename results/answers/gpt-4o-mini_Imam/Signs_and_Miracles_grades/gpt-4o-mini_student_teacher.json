  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the role of signs and miracles in affirming the truth of God's message within Islamic theology. However, the answer lacks the specific Christian perspective requested in the concern, focusing solely on the Islamic view. The student did not address the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate Christian theological perspectives on the significance of signs and miracles in confirming God's message as exemplified in the acts of Jesus and the apostles."
