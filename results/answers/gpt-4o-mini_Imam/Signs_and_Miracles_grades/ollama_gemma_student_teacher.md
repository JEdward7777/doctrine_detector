In Islamic theology, signs and miracles serve a significant function in affirming the truth of God's message and the authenticity of His messengers. The concept of miracles, known as "mu'jizat" in Arabic, is often associated with the prophets, including Jesus (Isa) and the apostles (Hawariyyun), as special manifestations of God's power meant to validate their prophethood and divine message.

1. **Affirmation of Prophethood**: Miracles act as evidence of the divine authority behind a prophet. In the case of Jesus, the Quran acknowledges his ability to perform miracles—healing the sick, raising the dead, and other extraordinary acts—as a means of demonstrating his prophetic mission. The Quran mentions these miracles in Surah Al-Imran (3:49) and Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:110), emphasizing that they were performed by God's permission.

2. **Call to Faith**: Miracles can serve to draw people's attention to the message being delivered. They often provoke reflection, inviting individuals to consider the implications of the signs they witness. This is evident in the accounts of Jesus's miracles, which prompted many to follow him and believe in the message he brought.

3. **Support and Comfort for Believers**: For the followers of the prophets, witnessing miracles can strengthen their faith. The apostles, as companions of Jesus, witnessed his miraculous acts firsthand, solidifying their commitment to the message. In challenging times, these signs provided reassurance of divine support.

4. **The Nature of Miraculous Signs**: In Islam, it is understood that miracles are not just spectacular events; they are purposeful. They convey clear lessons, enhance understanding, and reaffirm the oneness (Tawhid) and power of God. Each miracle is a reminder of God’s sovereignty over creation and His ability to intervene in the natural order.

5. **Limitations of Miracles**: While miracles play a crucial role, Islam teaches that faith ultimately comes from conviction in the heart rather than mere witnessing of signs. The Quran mentions that even with the occurrence of miracles, some individuals may remain disbelievers, highlighting that the acceptance of faith is a personal journey rooted in one's relationship with God.

In summary, signs and miracles in the context of Jesus and the apostles serve as critical tools in affirming the truthfulness of God's message, inviting reflection, providing assurance to believers, and demonstrating the divine nature of prophethood. However, they are meant to complement faith rather than serve as the sole basis for belief.
