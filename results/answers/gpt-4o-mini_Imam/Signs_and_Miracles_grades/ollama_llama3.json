  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. It provides a clear overview of the significance of miracles in Islamic theology, highlighting their role in affirming prophethood, calling to faith, supporting believers, and conveying divine lessons. The text also touches on the limitations of miracles, emphasizing that faith ultimately comes from conviction in the heart.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the response could be improved:\n\n* While the response provides a good overview of Islamic theology regarding miracles, it would benefit from more explicit connections to the concern about the relationship between faith and signs. For example, the text could further explore how the apostles' witnessing of Jesus's miracles might have impacted their own faith.\n* The response could also delve deeper into the implications of the limitations of miracles for our understanding of God's revelation and our faith in Him.\n\nOverall, I would say that this response is well-written and effectively addresses the concern, but could benefit from a bit more depth and nuance."
