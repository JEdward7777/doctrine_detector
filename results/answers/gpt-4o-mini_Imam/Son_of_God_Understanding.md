## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the term "Son of God" when referring to Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) is understood in a fundamentally different context compared to Christian theology. In Islam, Allah (God) is unique and incomparable, and the concept of God having a son is not consistent with Islamic teachings. The Quran emphasizes the absolute oneness of God (Tawhid) and rejects any division of God's nature or any form of literal parentage.

Islam respects Jesus as one of the great prophets and messengers of God, but it does not accept the notion of His divinity or His being the son of God. The Quran explicitly states that Allah does not have a son. In Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112), it is affirmed that:

> "Say, He is Allah, [who is] One, 
> Allah, the Eternal Refuge. 
> He neither begets nor is born, 
> Nor is there to Him any equivalent." (Quran 112:1-4)

Thus, in the Islamic perspective, Jesus' relationship with God is that of a revered prophet who submitted to God's will, not as a divine son in any literal sense. Muslims believe that Jesus was born miraculously to the Virgin Mary (Maryam), and he performed miracles by God's permission, but he is a servant and messenger of Allah, rather than a divine figure.

This perspective is central to Islamic theology, which seeks to maintain the strict monotheistic framework that characterizes the faith.
