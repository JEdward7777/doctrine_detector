  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student accurately explains the Islamic perspective on the term \"Son of God\" concerning Jesus and highlights the rejection of any notion of Jesus being the literal son of God in Islamic theology. The student correctly references Quranic verses to support their points. However, the student could enhance their answer by discussing the Christian perspective on the term \"Son of God\" and how it signifies Jesus' unique divine nature and relationship with God the Father within Christian doctrine. This addition would provide a more comprehensive comparison between Islamic and Christian beliefs on this topic."
