  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus as the \"Son of God,\" the answer does not address the concern of understanding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God from a Christian worldview. The Christian perspective acknowledges Jesus as fully God and part of the Holy Trinity, sharing the same divine nature as God the Father. The student's response, although informative, does not align with the specific concern provided."
