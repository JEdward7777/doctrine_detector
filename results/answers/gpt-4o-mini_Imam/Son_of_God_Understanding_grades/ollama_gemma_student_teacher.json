  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on the term \"Son of God\" and its implications for Jesus' relationship with God the Father. It accurately highlights the central tenet of Islam, Tawhid (monotheism), and explains how it differs from Christian theology. The student provides clear textual evidence from the Quran to support their claims, and their overall presentation is well-reasoned and articulate. However, the answer does not address the Christian specific worldview as requested in the prompt."
