  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus as not being the literal Son of God and emphasizes the oneness of God in Islam. However, it does not directly address the concern regarding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God from a Christian worldview. The response focuses more on contrasting Islamic beliefs with Christian theology rather than addressing the specific concern provided."
