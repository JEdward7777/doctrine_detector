However, from a Christian worldview, the response does not address the concern of understanding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God. The Christian belief is that Jesus is fully God and shares the same nature as God the Father, which was not acknowledged or addressed in the response. So, while the Islamic perspective was well presented, it did not engage with the specific concern from a Christian worldview."
