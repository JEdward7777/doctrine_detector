  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation comparing the distinctions between the title 'Son of God' for Jesus and 'sons of God' for believers from an Islamic perspective. The response effectively highlights the differences in nature, context, unity of God, and roles of Jesus and believers in both Christianity and Islam. However, there was a lack of direct comparison or contrast with the Christian view specified in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and provided valuable insights, but could improve by directly addressing the Christian perspective in relation to the question."
