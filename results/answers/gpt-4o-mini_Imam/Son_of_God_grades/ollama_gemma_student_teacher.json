  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theological distinctions between the titles 'Son of God' and 'sons of God' within both Christianity and Islam. The response clearly articulates the Islamic perspective on Jesus being a prophet but not divine, and the rejection of the concept of divine sonship. Additionally, the student provides a well-reasoned explanation of the metaphorical use of 'sons of God' for believers in Islam. Overall, this is a well-written and informative response."
