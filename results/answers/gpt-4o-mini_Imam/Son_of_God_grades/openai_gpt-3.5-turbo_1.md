# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) differs significantly from the term 'sons of God' used for believers. Here are key distinctions:

1. **Nature of Jesus**: In Christianity, Jesus is referred to as the 'Son of God' to signify his divine nature and unique relationship with God. This title suggests a literal interpretation of divine sonship. In Islam, however, Jesus is regarded as a prophet and messenger of God but not divine himself. The Quran clearly emphasizes the oneness of God (Tawhid) and rejects any notions of God having a son. 

2. **Context of Believers**: In the Quran and Islamic teachings, the term 'sons of God' can refer to believers metaphorically, illustrating their close relationship with God, who is seen as a nurturing and guiding figure. This is a spiritual designation rather than a literal physical relationship. Believers are described as ‘ servants’ or ‘worshippers’ of God, highlighting their servitude and submission to God rather than implying any divine lineage.

3. **Unity of God**: The fundamental principle in Islam is the absolute oneness of God (Allah). The concept of God having a son contradicts this core belief and is viewed as a serious theological error. The Quran states, "Say, 'He is Allah, [Who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent.'" (Quran 112:1-4). Thus, while believers are called to recognize their role and relationship with Allah, it remains within the context of monotheism.

4. **Roles of Jesus and Believers**: In Islamic theology, Jesus is one of the greatest prophets and was born miraculously to the Virgin Mary (Maryam), but he is not considered divine and has no role as God's son in a literal sense. Believers, on the other hand, are seen as having a communal and faithful relationship with Allah, striving for piety and righteousness as part of the Muslim Ummah.

In summary, the title 'Son of God' as it applies to Jesus in Christianity construes a specific, divine relationship that Islam firmly rejects, while the term 'sons of God' for believers is a metaphorical expression of their spiritual connection to the Creator, emphasizing servitude and worship within the framework of complete monotheism.
