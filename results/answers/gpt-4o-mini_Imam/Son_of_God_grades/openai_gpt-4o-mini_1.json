  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and detailed explanation of the differences between the Christian understanding of the term 'Son of God' as applied to Jesus and the broader concept of 'sons of God' for believers. The use of Islamic beliefs to contrast and clarify these distinctions is effective in addressing the concern of avoiding confusion in theological discussions. The response is well-structured, insightful, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview. Well done!"
