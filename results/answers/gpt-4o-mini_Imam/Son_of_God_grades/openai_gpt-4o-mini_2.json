The Christian worldview is upheld by emphasizing the unique divinity of Jesus as God's only Son, while also acknowledging the metaphorical usage of 'sons of God' for believers. This understanding contributes to a clear distinction between the two concepts, which is crucial for maintaining theological accuracy in dialogue. Great job in presenting the Christian perspective in a thoughtful and respectful manner."
