  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the various interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6:1-4, showcasing a deep understanding of biblical interpretation and its significance in understanding scripture passages. The inclusion of different theological perspectives adds depth and context to the discussion. The response could benefit from a clearer thesis statement to tie the various interpretations together, but overall, it demonstrates a strong grasp of the importance of biblical interpretation in deriving meaning from biblical texts."
