  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the process of becoming a saint in Christianity, including the importance of faith, moral living, miracles, and the canonization process. However, the student did not clearly emphasize the central role of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of holiness, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student's response would benefit from emphasizing that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ's saving work, rather than solely focusing on their own deeds and virtues."
