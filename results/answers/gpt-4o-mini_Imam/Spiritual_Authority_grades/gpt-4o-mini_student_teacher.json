  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized explanation of the differences between spiritual authorities and earthly authorities in a Biblical context. They demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and outlined key distinctions clearly. However, the answer did not directly address the Biblical teaching referenced in Ephesians 6:12, which should have been the focus according to the concern provided. The student's answer from an Islamic perspective also does not align perfectly with the Christian worldview being assessed. Additional focus on the Biblical passage and aligning the response more closely with Christian teachings would have improved the grade."
