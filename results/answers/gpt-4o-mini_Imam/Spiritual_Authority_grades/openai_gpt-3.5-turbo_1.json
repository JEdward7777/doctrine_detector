  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-explained comparison between spiritual and earthly authorities within a Biblical context, addressing their nature, focus, duration, relationship with the faithful, and ultimate accountability. It effectively recognizes the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority and their implications in a Christian's life. The integration of Ephesians 6:12 as a reference point adds depth to the explanation and aligns well with a Christian worldview. Great job in presenting a comprehensive analysis from a Christian perspective."
