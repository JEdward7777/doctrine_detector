It aligns with the Christian concern of remaining vigilant against spiritual deceit that leads one away from the truth of God's sovereignty. The connection is made effectively between the concept of demons leading to idolatry in Islamic belief and the importance for Christians to guard against similar deceptions. The response could be strengthened by explicitly highlighting the importance of holding firmly to the truth of God's sovereignty as revealed through Jesus Christ."
