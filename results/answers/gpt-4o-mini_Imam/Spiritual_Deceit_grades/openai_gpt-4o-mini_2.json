The explanation of how demons deceive people into idolatry aligns well with the Christian worldview of recognizing the supremacy of Yahweh as the one true God. The emphasis on reliance on the guidance of the Qur'an and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad may not directly resonate with a Christian worldview, but the overall understanding of spiritual deception and staying true to the sovereignty of God is well articulated."
