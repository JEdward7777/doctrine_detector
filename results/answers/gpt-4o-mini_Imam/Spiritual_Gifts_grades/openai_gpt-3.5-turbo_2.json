The insights on empowerment for service, diversity and unity, responsibility, God's sovereignty, encouragement of community, and moral living were well articulated and aligned with the concern of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and obedience to the Holy Spirit. The integration of Islamic beliefs on talents and skills as gifts from Allah for community benefit further enriched the analysis. Overall, the response effectively addressed the concern within a Christian worldview while acknowledging similarities with Islamic perspectives."
