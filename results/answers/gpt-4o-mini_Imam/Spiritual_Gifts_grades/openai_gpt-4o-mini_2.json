It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. The integration of Islamic perspectives on talents and service, while informative, could have been more explicitly connected to the Christian worldview in addressing the concern."
