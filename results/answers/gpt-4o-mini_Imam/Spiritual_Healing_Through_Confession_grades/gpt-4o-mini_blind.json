  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student made valid points regarding the importance of confessing sins for fostering accountability, building community, receiving support, encouraging forgiveness, and experiencing spiritual healing, there are significant doctrinal discrepancies in the explanation provided. The response as a whole presents a perspective from Islam rather than a Christian-specific worldview as requested, failing to align with Christian beliefs on confession, forgiveness, and spiritual healing. The student should focus on incorporating Christian teachings and references in their response to align with the requested perspective."
