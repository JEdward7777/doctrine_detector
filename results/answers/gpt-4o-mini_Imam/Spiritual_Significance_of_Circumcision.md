## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The phrase "circumcision of the heart" in a Christian context symbolizes the spiritual transformation and purification of an individual's heart and soul. It draws from the biblical concept found in several passages, notably in the Old Testament (e.g., Deuteronomy 30:6) and the New Testament (e.g., Romans 2:29). 

In these scriptures, "circumcision" is used metaphorically to signify an inner change rather than merely an external ritual. Just as physical circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and the Israelites, the circumcision of the heart represents a commitment to God that involves a deep, internal dedication and the desire to live in accordance with His will. It indicates repentance, the removal of sinful inclinations, and the embrace of a sincere faith, leading to a life characterized by love, compassion, and obedience to God's commandments.

Thus, in a Christian belief system, it emphasizes that true spirituality and connection with God go beyond external rituals and are rooted in the condition of one's heart and spirit.
