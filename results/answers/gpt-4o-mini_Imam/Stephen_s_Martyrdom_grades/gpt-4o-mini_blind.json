  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough analysis of the significance of the stoning of Stephen in the early Christian church. The student effectively outlines key themes such as martyrdom, persecution, sectarian conflict, and the impact on the early church. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a good understanding of the historical and theological implications of this event. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the spiritual significance of Stephen's martyrdom and the connection to Christ's own suffering. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references or doctrinal insights could further strengthen the response. Overall, a solid analysis with room for deeper theological reflection."
