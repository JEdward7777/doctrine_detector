  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough and detailed analysis of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church, touching on key themes such as martyrdom, persecution, sectarian conflict, and the impact on the early church. The student effectively connects these themes to the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively interprets the events in the context of faith and fidelity to Christ. Great job!"
