## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery is mentioned in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament. In the book of Leviticus (20:10) and Deuteronomy (22:22), it is stated that both parties involved in adultery should be put to death. This correlates with the ancient laws given to the Israelites, which were intended to uphold community morality and social order.

From a theological perspective, stoning and similar penalties were rooted in a context where the covenant relationship between God and the Israelites was paramount. The severe penalties were meant to reflect the seriousness of breaking God's commandments and the importance of maintaining purity within the community.

However, the New Testament introduces a different perspective on justice and mercy. In the story of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11), Jesus encounters a situation where the Pharisees bring a woman accused of adultery before Him, seeking to test Him regarding the application of the law. Jesus responds by saying, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." This moment emphasizes personal accountability and the concept of mercy, as He then tells the woman, "Neither do I condemn you. Go now and leave your life of sin."

This episode illustrates the balance of justice and mercy in God's character. While the law prescribed a specific punishment, Jesus acknowledged human fallibility and highlighted the importance of compassion and forgiveness. This reflects a shift towards understanding divine justice not merely as punitive but as restorative, seeking to bring individuals back into right relationship with God.

In Islam, similar themes are found, as the Quran and Hadith emphasize justice and mercy, encouraging forgiveness and repentance over harsh punishments. Ultimately, both scriptures stress the importance of accountability while simultaneously providing avenues for mercy and reconciliation.
