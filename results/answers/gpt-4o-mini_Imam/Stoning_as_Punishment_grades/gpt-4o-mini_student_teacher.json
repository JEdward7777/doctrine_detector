  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough explanation of the practice of stoning in the Bible, highlighted the shift in perspective from the Old Testament to the New Testament regarding justice and mercy, and made a relevant comparison with Islamic perspectives. They have shown a good understanding of the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. However, there could be a slight deduction for not explicitly linking the reflection of God's justice and mercy to the concern provided. Overall, the student has presented a well-reasoned and insightful response with appropriate references to scripture."
