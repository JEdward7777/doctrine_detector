  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response displays a solid understanding of the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments, particularly in the context of stoning as a punishment for adultery. The student effectively contrasts the Old Testament perspective on stoning with the New Testament teachings of Jesus, emphasizing the shift towards mercy and forgiveness. The integration of relevant biblical verses and theological perspectives demonstrates a thorough grasp of the topic. The response could have been further enhanced by delving into the theological implications of God's justice and mercy in greater depth."
