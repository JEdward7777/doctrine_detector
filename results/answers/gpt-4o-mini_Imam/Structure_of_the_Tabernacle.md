## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The tabernacle, as described in the biblical tradition, particularly in the Book of Exodus, was divided into two main sections: the **Holy Place** and the **Most Holy Place** (also known as the Holy of Holies).

1. **Holy Place**: This section was the first chamber of the tabernacle. It contained three important items:
   - **The Altar of Incense**: This was used for burning incense, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God.
   - **The Table of Showbread**: This table held the showbread, which consisted of twelve loaves representing the twelve tribes of Israel, replaced regularly to signify God’s provision.
   - **The Menorah (Lampstand)**: This provided light in the Holy Place, symbolizing the light of God’s presence.

2. **Most Holy Place (Holy of Holies)**: This was the innermost chamber of the tabernacle, separated by a veil. It contained one primary item:
   - **The Ark of the Covenant**: This sacred object held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, a pot of manna, and Aaron's rod that budded. The Ark represented the presence of God among the Israelites and was covered by the Mercy Seat, where God’s glory would dwell.

These sections served crucial roles in the worship and religious practices of the Israelites, emphasizing the holiness of God and the importance of approaching Him with reverence and in accordance with His commandments.
