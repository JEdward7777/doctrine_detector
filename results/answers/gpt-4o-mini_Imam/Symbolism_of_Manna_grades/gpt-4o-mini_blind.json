From a Christian perspective, manna is specifically associated with Yahweh's provision for the Israelites in the Old Testament. The response could have further emphasized the biblical significance of manna as a foreshadowing of Christ as the ultimate provision and sustenance for believers. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to include references to relevant Bible verses to support the discussion."
