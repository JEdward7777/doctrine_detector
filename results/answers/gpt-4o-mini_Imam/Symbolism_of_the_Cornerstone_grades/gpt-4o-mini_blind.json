The student effectively draws parallels between the foundational role of a cornerstone in a physical building and Jesus' significance in guiding his followers towards monotheism and righteous living. However, the answer could have been improved by more explicitly highlighting Jesus' unique role as the Son of God and Savior in Christianity. It is important to maintain doctrinal correctness when discussing Jesus in a Christian-specific worldview. Additionally, reinforcing key Christian beliefs such as Jesus' sacrificial death for the redemption of humanity would have strengthened the answer."
