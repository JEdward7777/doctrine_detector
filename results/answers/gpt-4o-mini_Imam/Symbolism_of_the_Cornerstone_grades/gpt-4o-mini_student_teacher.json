  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student did a commendable job in drawing parallels between the metaphor of the cornerstone and Jesus within an Islamic context, there are some key aspects that they missed. The primary concern, which was aligning believers' lives with Christ's teachings, was not explicitly addressed in the response. The focus remained primarily on explaining Jesus's role in Islam rather than illustrating the relationship between Jesus and his followers in guiding their lives.\n\nAdditionally, the teacher's reference answer highlighted that Jesus is both the source of strength for believers and the reference point for their lives and faith, which was not clearly emphasized in the student's response. This core aspect of the relationship between Jesus and his followers was not effectively conveyed in the student's explanation.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the metaphor of the cornerstone within an Islamic context, but fell slightly short in directly addressing the concern regarding aligning believers' lives with Christ's teachings."
