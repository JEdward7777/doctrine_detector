  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of exploring the metaphor of the cornerstone in relation to Jesus and his role as a prophet in Islam. It provides a thoughtful analysis of how Jesus can be seen as a foundation for faith, guidance, connection to a larger community, symbol of hope and redemption, and testimony of faith. The response also effectively highlights the importance of Jesus's teachings and example in guiding believers towards a deeper understanding of faith and submission to God's will.\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is in directly addressing the concern about understanding this relationship helping believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example. While the response does touch on this issue, it could be more explicit in explaining how Jesus's role as the cornerstone can help believers live out their faith in a way that is consistent with his teachings.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides thoughtful insights into the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in Islamic theology."
