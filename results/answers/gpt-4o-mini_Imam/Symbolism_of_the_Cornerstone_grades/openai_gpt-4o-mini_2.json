The student effectively connects the significance of Jesus as a messenger and leader guiding his followers towards faith and righteous living. The points made align well with the concern provided, demonstrating how understanding this relationship can help believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example. However, it could be strengthened by incorporating more explicit references to how Christ's teachings and example specifically impact believers' lives in practice within an Islamic framework."
