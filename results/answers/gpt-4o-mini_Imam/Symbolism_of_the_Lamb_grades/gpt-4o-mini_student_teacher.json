They effectively connect the symbolism of innocence and substitution with the sacrificial system in the Old Testament and the ultimate atonement through Christ as the \"Lamb of God.\" The reference to Islamic context, while informative, slightly deviates from the Christian-specific focus of the question. Overall, a strong understanding and application of Christian worldview in interpreting the symbolism of the lamb in sacrifices."
