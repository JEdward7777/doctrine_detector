However, the student could have focused more directly on the specific purpose stated in the reference answer of being a permanent place of worship for the Israelites to pray and offer sacrifices to God. Nonetheless, they demonstrated a solid grasp of the significance of Solomon's Temple in the context of Old Testament worship from a Christian perspective."
