It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the connection between the geographical location of the Temple Mount and the symbolism of Zion, showcasing a Christian specific worldview through its emphasis on the divine presence of God in Jerusalem. The response could be enhanced by incorporating more direct references to biblical scriptures to strengthen the Christian perspective further."
