## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The concept of the temple as God's dwelling is significant in both the Old and New Testaments, though it is expressed in different ways and contexts.

### Old Testament

In the Old Testament, the temple is literally understood as a physical structure where God's presence resides. 

1. **The Tabernacle**: Initially, during the time of Moses, God's dwelling among His people was represented by the Tabernacle, a portable sanctuary (Exodus 26). This structure was designed according to divine specifications and served as the center of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness.

2. **Solomon's Temple**: Later, King Solomon built the first permanent temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6-7). This temple was considered the house of God, a sacred place where His presence would dwell. The completion of the temple marked a crucial moment in Israel's history, as it signified the culmination of the Exodus and the establishment of a central place for worship (1 Kings 8:10-13). The temple contained the Holy of Holies, the innermost sanctuary where the Ark of the Covenant resided, symbolizing God's throne on earth.

3. **God's Presence and Glory**: The Old Testament emphasizes God's glory filling the temple (1 Kings 8:11), indicating His active presence among His people. Prophets spoke of the temple as central to Israel's identity and relationship with God, as seen in verses like Psalm 132:13-14, where it reflects God's choice of Zion as His dwelling place.

### New Testament

In the New Testament, the concept of the temple undergoes a transformative shift.

1. **Jesus as the Temple**: In the Gospel of John (John 1:14), it is stated, "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us." The Greek term used here, "σκηνόω" (skenóō), can mean "to pitch a tent," linking to the idea of a dwelling place. Jesus refers to His body as the temple in John 2:19-21, indicating that He embodies God's presence fully.

2. **The Believers as the Temple**: The New Testament further expands the concept of the temple to encompass the community of believers. In 1 Corinthians 3:16, Paul tells the early Christians, "Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst?" This emphasizes the idea that the presence of God is not confined to a physical location but dwells within the hearts of believers.

3. **The Church as the New Temple**: In Ephesians 2:19-22, Paul writes about the church being built together as a dwelling in which God lives by His Spirit. This illustrates a communal aspect of God's presence being among His people, reshaping the understanding of the temple to a spiritual edifice rather than a physical structure.

### Conclusion

The Old Testament presents the temple as a sacred space where God dwells among His people in a physical sense. In contrast, the New Testament transitions this concept to express God's presence in the person of Jesus and among the community of believers. Both testaments highlight the central theme of God desiring to dwell with humanity, ultimately shaping the understanding of His relationship with His creation through different epochs.
