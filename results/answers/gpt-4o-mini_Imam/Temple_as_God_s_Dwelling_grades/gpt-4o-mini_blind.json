  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-structured explanation of how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is expressed in both the Old and New Testaments. It effectively highlights key points such as the Tabernacle, Solomon's Temple, Jesus as the Temple, believers as the Temple, and the Church as the New Temple. The integration of relevant scriptural references enhances the clarity and depth of the explanation. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more direct references to doctrinal teachings or theological implications related to the concept of the temple in each testament."
