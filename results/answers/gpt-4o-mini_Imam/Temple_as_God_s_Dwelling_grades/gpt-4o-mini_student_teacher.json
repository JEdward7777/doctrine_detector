  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively explored the theological implications of God dwelling among His people in both the Old and New Testaments. They covered key points from both testaments and connected them to the concept of God's presence. However, the student's answer could be improved by directly addressing the teacher's specified concern more explicitly and incorporating more references to the specific passage provided in the teacher's answer."
