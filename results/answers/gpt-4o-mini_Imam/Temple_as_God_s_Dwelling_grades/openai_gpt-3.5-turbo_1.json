  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people from both the Old and New Testaments. It effectively explores the shift in understanding from a physical temple to Jesus and believers being the dwelling place of God. The explanation is clear, well-supported with scriptural references, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. Minor improvements could include further elaboration on the transformative nature of God's presence shifting from the physical to the spiritual and its impact on the relationship between God and humanity."
