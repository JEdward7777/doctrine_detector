## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islam, Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) is regarded as a prophet and messenger of God, though not as the Son of God or part of a divine trinity as held in Christianity. The story of Jesus' temptation is recognized in Christian theology, particularly in the New Testament, where he is tested by Satan after fasting for 40 days in the wilderness.

While the specific details of Jesusâ€™ response to temptation as narrated in the Bible are not directly covered in the Quran, Islamic teachings do emphasize the notion of resistance to temptation and reliance on God's guidance. 

In the Gospel accounts, Jesus responds to each of Satan's temptations by quoting scriptures from the Torah, demonstrating his deep connection to God's word. For example:
1. When tempted to turn stones into bread, he responds that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.
2. In response to being asked to throw himself from the pinnacle of the temple to prove his divinity, he states that one must not put God to the test.
3. Lastly, when offered all the kingdoms of the world in exchange for worshipping Satan, he firmly insists that one should worship the Lord God and serve Him only.

These interactions highlight Jesus' reliance on divine scripture and his steadfastness in faith, which are qualities highly esteemed in Islam as well. The broader Islamic understanding stresses that all prophets, including Jesus, exemplified submission to God's will and offered guidance to humanity on living a life that pleases God. 

In essence, while the specific narratives may differ, the emphasis on resisting temptation and adhering to God's commands is a shared theme in both Islamic and Christian teachings.
