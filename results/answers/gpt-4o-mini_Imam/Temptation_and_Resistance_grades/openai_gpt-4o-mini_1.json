  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively explains Jesus' resistance to temptation in both Christian and Islamic perspectives, emphasizing his obedience and reliance on God. The student accurately connects the significance of Jesus' actions as a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The only minor critique is that more direct references to Christian scripture could have been included to further strengthen the evaluation."
