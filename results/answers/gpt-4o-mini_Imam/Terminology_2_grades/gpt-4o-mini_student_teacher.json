  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer by detailing multiple terms used in Christian communities to refer to the Lord's Supper, demonstrating a solid understanding of the various theological perspectives and traditions within Christianity. The inclusion of key terms such as Eucharist, Holy Communion, The Lord's Supper, Mass, Sacrament of the Altar, Divine Liturgy, and The Breaking of Bread shows a thorough grasp of the diversity in terminology surrounding this sacred practice. The response could have been enhanced by including a shorter, more focused list of terms as provided in the reference answer, but overall, the student has shown a strong knowledge of the topic."
