While the terms listed are relevant to Islamic practices, it would have been beneficial for the student to also address the question by considering alternative terms within a Christian context, as the original question was asking for alternatives to describe a deacon specifically. Additionally, a more thorough exploration of the roles and responsibilities of a deacon in Christianity would have enhanced the answer."
