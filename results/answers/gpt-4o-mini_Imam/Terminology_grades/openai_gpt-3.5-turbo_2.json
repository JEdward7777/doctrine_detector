  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the ways service roles are identified within a Muslim context in comparison to a Christian context. It correctly identifies specific terms within Islamic practices that reflect qualities of service and leadership similar to those of a deacon in a Christian church. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern raised and provides relevant information to address it. Some additional elaboration or examples could further strengthen the response."
