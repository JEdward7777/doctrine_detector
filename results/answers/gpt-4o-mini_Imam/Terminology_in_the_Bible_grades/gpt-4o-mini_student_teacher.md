## [Answer](../Terminology_in_the_Bible.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of the Bible, three terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people are "Hebrews," "Israelites," and "Jews." 

1. **Hebrews**: This term is often used to refer to the descendants of Abraham and is generally associated with the early ancestors of the Israelites.

2. **Israelites**: This term specifically refers to the descendants of Jacob, who was also known as Israel. The Israelites are the twelve tribes that stem from Jacob's sons.

3. **Jews**: This term is derived from "Judah," one of the twelve tribes. Over time, it came to refer more broadly to the members of the Jewish faith and the people of Judah, particularly after the Babylonian exile.

While these terms have distinct historical and cultural contexts, they are often used to describe the same group of people chosen by God in the biblical narrative.
