  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation from an Islamic perspective on why testing God is discouraged, referencing core beliefs, Qur'anic guidance, historical context, and the importance of reflection and trust in Allah. The answer effectively demonstrates an understanding of the principle and emphasizes the importance of humility and faith in relation to God. However, the specific concern highlighted by the teacher in the reference answer - regarding making God perform a miracle for us and taking advantage of His mercy - was not directly addressed by the student. Though the response is insightful and well-structured, there could have been a clearer alignment with the specified concern for a perfect score."
