  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough comparison of testing and temptation in both Islamic and biblical contexts, aligning more closely with Islamic teachings but acknowledging the biblical perspective. The differences between testing and temptation are clearly explained, illustrating their distinct roles in spiritual life. The response effectively addresses the concern of differentiating between testing and temptation for spiritual discernment. However, it could have further emphasized the biblical perspective on testing and temptation and incorporated more direct references to relevant biblical passages for a more comprehensive analysis."
