However, since the question specifically asked for the command Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven within a Christian context, the response could have focused more on the Christian perspective without delving extensively into Islamic beliefs. Additionally, while mentioning the Qur'an and the finality of Muhammad's prophethood can be relevant in interfaith discussions, it could be seen as slightly detracting from the central focus of the question."
