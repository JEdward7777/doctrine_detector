## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but Muslims do not view him as divine. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was not crucified but was raised to heaven by God.

In the Christian context, before ascending to heaven, Jesus commanded His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe everything He had commanded (Matthew 28:19-20). This passage is often referred to as the Great Commission.

While we acknowledge this in the context of our discussions with Christians, in Islam, the emphasis is on the teachings of the Qur'an and the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the last messenger of God.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response accurately contrasts the beliefs of Islam and Christianity regarding Jesus and the Great Commission. However, since the question specifically asked for the command Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven within a Christian context, the response could have focused more on the Christian perspective without delving extensively into Islamic beliefs. Additionally, while mentioning the Qur'an and the finality of Muhammad's prophethood can be relevant in interfaith discussions, it could be seen as slightly detracting from the central focus of the question.
