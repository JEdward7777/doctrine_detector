However, the answer is not entirely consistent with the Christian specific worldview as it includes information relevant to Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and the finality of Muhammad's prophethood. The inclusion of these extra details is somewhat irrelevant to the question from a Christian perspective and may potentially confuse readers."
