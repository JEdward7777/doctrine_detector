## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but Muslims do not view him as divine. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was not crucified but was raised to heaven by God.

In the Christian context, before ascending to heaven, Jesus commanded His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe everything He had commanded (Matthew 28:19-20). This passage is often referred to as the Great Commission.

While we acknowledge this in the context of our discussions with Christians, in Islam, the emphasis is on the teachings of the Qur'an and the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the last messenger of God.

**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** 
The student's answer correctly identifies the command given by Jesus to His disciples before ascending to heaven, referencing the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20. However, the answer is not entirely consistent with the Christian specific worldview as it includes information relevant to Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and the finality of Muhammad's prophethood. The inclusion of these extra details is somewhat irrelevant to the question from a Christian perspective and may potentially confuse readers.
