## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but Muslims do not view him as divine. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was not crucified but was raised to heaven by God.

In the Christian context, before ascending to heaven, Jesus commanded His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe everything He had commanded (Matthew 28:19-20). This passage is often referred to as the Great Commission.

While we acknowledge this in the context of our discussions with Christians, in Islam, the emphasis is on the teachings of the Qur'an and the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the last messenger of God.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 60.

While the response correctly references the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20, it falls short in fully understanding the mission of discipleship as commanded by Jesus. The original passage mentions making "disciples of all nations" and teaching them to observe everything He had commanded, whereas the response only mentions obeying everything He had commanded.

Additionally, the response could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the Great Commission relates to the broader mission of spreading the Gospel. It's a good start, but it feels somewhat superficial.

To improve, I would suggest expanding on what it means to "make disciples" and how this commission is connected to the overall message of Christianity. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concern at hand.
