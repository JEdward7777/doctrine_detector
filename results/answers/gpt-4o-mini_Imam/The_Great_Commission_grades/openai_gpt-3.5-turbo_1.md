## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but Muslims do not view him as divine. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was not crucified but was raised to heaven by God.

In the Christian context, before ascending to heaven, Jesus commanded His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe everything He had commanded (Matthew 28:19-20). This passage is often referred to as the Great Commission.

While we acknowledge this in the context of our discussions with Christians, in Islam, the emphasis is on the teachings of the Qur'an and the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the last messenger of God.

70.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1.md)
Grade: 70

Comment: The response accurately connects the command of Jesus to His disciples to make disciples of all nations, baptize them, and teach obedience to His commands with the Great Commission mentioned in Matthew 28:19-20. The grade is lower due to a lack of depth in exploring the significance of discipleship in the Christian faith and how it relates to the mission of spreading the gospel. Expanding on the importance of disciple-making and its role in fulfilling the Great Commission from a Christian perspective would have enhanced the response.
