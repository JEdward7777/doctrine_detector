## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered a prophet and messenger of God, but Muslims do not view him as divine. According to Islamic belief, Jesus was not crucified but was raised to heaven by God.

In the Christian context, before ascending to heaven, Jesus commanded His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe everything He had commanded (Matthew 28:19-20). This passage is often referred to as the Great Commission.

While we acknowledge this in the context of our discussions with Christians, in Islam, the emphasis is on the teachings of the Qur'an and the finality of the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the last messenger of God.
