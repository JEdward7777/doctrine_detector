The focus should have been on a biblical understanding of God's judgment in relation to mercy, rather than attempting to harmonize Islamic beliefs with the Christian text. The response could have been greatly improved by delving deeper into the specific implications of James 2:13 for Christians and how it relates to God's judgment."
