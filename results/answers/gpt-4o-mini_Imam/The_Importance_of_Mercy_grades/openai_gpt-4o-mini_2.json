  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively draws parallels between the Christian principle of mercy in James 2:13 and Islamic teachings on mercy, demonstrating a thoughtful understanding of the importance of mercy in both faith traditions. The connection to spiritual life and conduct is addressed well. The response could have further emphasized the unique Christian perspective on mercy and its significance in light of Christ's sacrifice, which would have strengthened the Christian-specific worldview aspect."
