## [Answer](../The_Messiah.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Christianity, "Jesus" and "Christ" represent two aspects of the figure central to the faith.

1. **Jesus**: This is the name given to the historical figure who lived in first-century Judea and is regarded by Christians as the Son of God and the Messiah. His Hebrew name was "Yeshua" (יֵשׁוּעַ) or "Joshua," which means "Yahweh is salvation." In Islam, Jesus is known as "Isa" (عيسى) and is recognized as a prophet and messenger of God, but not in the same divine or messianic sense as in Christianity.

2. **Christ**: This title comes from the Greek word "Christos," which translates the Hebrew term "Mashiach" (Messiah), meaning "the anointed one." In Christian belief, Jesus is called the Christ because he is seen as the fulfillment of the messianic prophecies found in the Hebrew scriptures, marking him as the anointed one sent by God.

Therefore, when combined, "Jesus Christ" signifies Jesus as the chosen one sent by God, and in Christianity, it denotes his role as the redeemer of humanity. In Islam, Jesus is still highly respected as a prophet but does not hold the same status as the Christ in Christian theology, as Muslims believe that the final prophet was Muhammad (peace be upon him).
