It effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on Jesus's identity as the Messiah and its implications within Christian belief. The response could be further enhanced by more explicitly connecting the concept of Jesus as the Messiah to his role as the redeemer of humanity, as well as by highlighting the salvific aspect of his messianic mission in Christianity."
