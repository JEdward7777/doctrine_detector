  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of prayer in Islam and effectively highlighted the differences between praying to Allah and talking to a false god. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the proper approach to prayer and effectively distinguishes it from false practices. However, the student could have integrated more explicitly Christian perspectives or scriptures to provide a broader Christian worldview on the topic."
