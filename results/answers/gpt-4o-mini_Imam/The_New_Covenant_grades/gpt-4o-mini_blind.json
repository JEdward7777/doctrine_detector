However, the answer focuses more on the Islamic viewpoint and lacks depth in explaining the significance and implications of God writing His law on the hearts within the context of the New Covenant specifically. More emphasis on the biblical foundation and the transformative nature of this relationship in Christianity would have strengthened the answer."
