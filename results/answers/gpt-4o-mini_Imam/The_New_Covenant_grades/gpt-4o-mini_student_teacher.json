  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer strays from the Christian-specific focus of the question and instead delves into Islamic perspectives, failing to address the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant from a Christian worldview. The answer lacks clarity and depth in connecting the concept of God writing His law on people's hearts to the transformative relationship emphasized in the New Covenant. The student should focus more on the Christian understanding and implications of this concept."
