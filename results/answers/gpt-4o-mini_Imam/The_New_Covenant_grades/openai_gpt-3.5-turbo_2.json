The mention of Islamic perspectives is respectfully done, showcasing similarities in the internalization of God's guidance. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant within Christianity specifically, highlighting the shift from external to internal obedience through the fulfillment of the law in Christ."
