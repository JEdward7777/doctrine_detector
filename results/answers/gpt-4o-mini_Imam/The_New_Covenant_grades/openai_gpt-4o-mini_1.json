The understanding of internalizing God's laws and fostering a transformative relationship with Him is well articulated. The reference to the Old Testament roots of this concept and its evolution into the principles of the New Covenant could have been more explicit to fully address the concern raised. Nonetheless, the response effectively demonstrates how this idea aligns with the Christian worldview."
