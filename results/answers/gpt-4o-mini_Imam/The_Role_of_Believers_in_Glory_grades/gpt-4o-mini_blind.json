The explanation lacks specific references to key New Testament passages beyond Romans 8:17 and does not sufficiently emphasize the significance of believers' union with Christ in terms of sharing in His glory and divinity. Additionally, the Islamic perspective provided at the end could potentially confuse the reader in understanding the Christian belief. A more thorough analysis and focus on Christian doctrines related to glorification with references to additional relevant Bible verses would improve the response."
