They accurately explain the spiritual union between Christ and believers and the ultimate fulfillment of salvation through transformation and resurrection. However, the answer could benefit from a more specific elaboration on the nature of the transformation and glory received by believers. Additionally, the student correctly acknowledges the difference in understanding salvation and glorification between Christianity and Islam."
