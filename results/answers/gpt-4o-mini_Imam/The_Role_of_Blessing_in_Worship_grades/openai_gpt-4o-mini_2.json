The explanation effectively connects the practices of blessing and praising with their spiritual dimensions and emphasizes their importance in fostering a believer's relationship with Allah and the Prophet Muhammad. The response could be enhanced by directly addressing the Christian concern to further relate the Islamic concepts to the context of blessings and worship in Christianity."
