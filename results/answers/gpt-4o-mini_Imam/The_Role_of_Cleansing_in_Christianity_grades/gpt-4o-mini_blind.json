  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of the concept of cleansing in the Bible, touching on the importance of ritual purity in the Old Testament and the spiritual cleansing through faith in Jesus Christ in the New Testament. However, the answer lacked depth in exploring the theological significance of cleansing in relation to sin and redemption in the New Testament specifically. Additionally, the response deviated from the Christian worldview by focusing too much on Islamic teachings rather than providing a thorough analysis from a Christian perspective."
