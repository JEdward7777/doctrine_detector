  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the concept of 'cleansing' in both the Old and New Testaments, touching on the significance of ritual purity in the Old Testament and the transformational aspect of faith in the New Testament. However, the response lacked a clear connection to the specified concern of understanding the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings to deepen appreciation for Christ's redemptive work. The student also highlighted Islamic teachings, which, while informative, diverted from the Christian-specific worldview requested. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic was demonstrated, but a clearer focus on the specified concern and a more exclusive Christian perspective would have strengthened the response."
