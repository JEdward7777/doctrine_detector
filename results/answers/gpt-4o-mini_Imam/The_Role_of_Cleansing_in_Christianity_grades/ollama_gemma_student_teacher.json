  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible and New Testament teachings on sin and redemption. \n\nThe student provides a clear explanation of the Old Testament concept of cleansing as primarily focusing on ritual purity, while the New Testament emphasizes spiritual transformation and forgiveness through faith in Jesus Christ. \n\nThe inclusion of references to specific biblical passages (1 John 1:7 and Acts 2:38) strengthens the student's argument. The comparison of the Christian concept of cleansing with Islamic teachings on purification and redemption demonstrates an additional depth of understanding."
