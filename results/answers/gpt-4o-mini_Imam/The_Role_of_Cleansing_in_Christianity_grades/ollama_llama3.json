The response provides a clear overview of the biblical context, including relevant passages, and shows a good understanding of the significance of Christ's redemptive work.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern and exploring how this understanding deepens one's appreciation for Christ's redemptive work. While the response does touch on this point, it is somewhat implicit and could be further developed to make a stronger connection between the two testaments and Christ's sacrifice.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical context and shows an attempt to address the concern by highlighting the evolution of the concept of cleansing from Old Testament practices to New Testament teachings. To take this response to the next level, it would be beneficial to more explicitly explore how understanding this relationship deepens one's appreciation for Christ's redemptive work, such as by highlighting specific examples or biblical passages that illustrate this point."
