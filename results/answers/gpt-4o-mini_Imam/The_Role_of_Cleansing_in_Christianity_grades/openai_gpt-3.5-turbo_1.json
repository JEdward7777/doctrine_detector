It effectively highlights the significance of Christ's redemptive work in cleansing believers from sin. The discussion on the evolution of the concept of cleansing from ritual practices to inner transformation through faith in Jesus is well articulated. The integration of Islamic teachings on spiritual cleansing adds a valuable comparative perspective. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique Christian perspective on the role of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for sin and the centrality of His redemptive work in the concept of cleansing."
