  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the Islamic perspective on divine selection, purpose, responsibility, trials, exemplary character, service to humanity, and diversity in God's messengers. It effectively highlights the belief in God's ultimate authority and wisdom in choosing leaders. The only consideration for the grade deduction is the lack of a direct reference to Christian teachings or Scriptures to analyze the concept of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders within the Christian community. Incorporating specific Christian beliefs or passages could further enhance the response with a Christian worldview perspective."
