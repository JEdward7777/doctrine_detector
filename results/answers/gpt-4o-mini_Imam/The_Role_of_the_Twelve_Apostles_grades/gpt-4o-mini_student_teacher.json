However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the key aspect highlighted in the reference answer, which is that the apostles were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and tasked with continuing His teachings after His ascension. The student should have emphasized this central point more strongly to align closely with the Christian belief that the apostles were specifically chosen by Jesus for a unique and crucial role in spreading His message."
