It acknowledges their importance as chosen representatives of Jesus, witnesses to his miracles and teachings, foundation of the early Church, diverse backgrounds for reaching various social groups, their martyrdom and legacy, and symbolism of authority within Christianity. The response also effectively relates Islamic teachings on the importance of Jesus and his disciples. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include more explicit references to relevant biblical passages or Christian theological concepts to further strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
