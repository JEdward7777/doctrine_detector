# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Christian theology, the concept of the "spirit of antichrist" is mentioned in the New Testament, specifically in the letters of John. In 1 John 2:18, it states, "Children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour." This suggests that the term "antichrist" refers not only to a specific figure who will come in the future but also to a spirit or attitude that exists in the world, opposing the teachings of Christ and promoting falsehood.

1 John 4:3 elaborates further, saying, "And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already." This indicates that any belief or ideology that denies the divinity of Jesus or opposes the core teachings of Christianity can be associated with the spirit of antichrist.

From a Muslim perspective, we recognize that the concept of antichrist (often referred to as "Dajjal" in Islamic eschatology) represents significant opposition to the truth of God. Muslims believe that Dajjal will appear in the end times, presenting falsehoods and misleading people. While the terminology and specifics may differ between Christianity and Islam, both traditions acknowledge the existence of forces that oppose divine truth and seek to lead people astray.

In summary, the Biblical understanding of the spirit of antichrist discusses the presence of deceptive, opposing influences in the world, while Muslims also believe in a figure who will challenge and mislead believers in the end times.
