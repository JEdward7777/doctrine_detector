2. **The Almighty** - This title appears explicitly in various translations of the Bible, notably in the book of Revelation and in other scriptures, emphasizing God's supreme power over all creation.

3. **Lord of Hosts** - This title, found frequently in the Old Testament (especially in the writings of the prophets), signifies God's authority over all heavenly forces and armies.
