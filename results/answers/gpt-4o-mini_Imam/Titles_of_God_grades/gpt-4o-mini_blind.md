In the Bible, several titles and names are used for God that convey the idea of His omnipotence and sovereignty. Some of the key titles that refer to God as 'Almighty' include:

1. **El Shaddai** - This Hebrew name translates to "God Almighty" and emphasizes God's power and sufficiency.

2. **The Almighty** - This title appears explicitly in various translations of the Bible, notably in the book of Revelation and in other scriptures, emphasizing God's supreme power over all creation.

3. **Lord of Hosts** - This title, found frequently in the Old Testament (especially in the writings of the prophets), signifies God's authority over all heavenly forces and armies.

4. **God of Hosts** - Similar to "Lord of Hosts," it signifies God's command over the armies of heaven and His ultimate authority.

5. **The Most High** - Often used to convey God's supreme position over all things, this title underscores His sovereignty and power.
