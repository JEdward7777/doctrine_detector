  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that convey God's omnipotence and sovereignty. However, the student missed some of the specific titles mentioned in the reference answer, such as 'Almighty God' and 'Lord Almighty'. While the student's answer demonstrated a good understanding of the concept, a more precise alignment with the reference answer would have enhanced the response."
