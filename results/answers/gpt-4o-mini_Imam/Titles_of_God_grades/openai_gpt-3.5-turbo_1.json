  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of titles for God that convey His omnipotence and sovereignty, expanding on the initial answer by including additional titles and further explanation. The mention of El Shaddai, The Almighty, Lord of Hosts, God of Hosts, and The Most High enriches the understanding of God's character as the ultimate authority and power. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how recognizing these titles enhances our understanding of God's character. Great job in elaborating on the initial answer with relevant and insightful information."
