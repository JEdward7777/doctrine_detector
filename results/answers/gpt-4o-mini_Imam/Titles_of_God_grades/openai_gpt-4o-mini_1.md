1. **El Shaddai** - This Hebrew name translates to "God Almighty" and emphasizes God's power and sufficiency.

2. **The Almighty** - This title appears explicitly in various translations of the Bible, notably in the book of Revelation and in other scriptures, emphasizing God's supreme power over all creation.

3. **Lord of Hosts** - This title, found frequently in the Old Testament (especially in the writings of the prophets), signifies God's authority over all heavenly forces and armies.

4. **God of Hosts** - Similar to "Lord of Hosts," it signifies God's command over the armies of heaven and His ultimate authority.
