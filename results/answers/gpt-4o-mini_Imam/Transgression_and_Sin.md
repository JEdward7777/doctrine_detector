## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic teachings, transgression is closely linked to the concepts of sin and disobedience, all of which revolve around the idea of violating divine commands or moral guidelines established by Allah.

1. **Sin (Dhanb)**: In Islam, a sin refers to any act that goes against the commandments of Allah or the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Sins can be classified into major sins (kabair) and minor sins (saghair), with major sins carrying heavier consequences. Committing a sin reflects a departure from the path of righteousness and leads to spiritual harm.

2. **Disobedience (Ma'siya)**: Disobedience refers to the act of not adhering to Allah's commands. It is often seen as a specific form of sin, where an individual knowingly goes against clear instructions, such as engaging in prohibited actions (haram). Disobedience stems from one's free will and often leads to feelings of guilt and remorse, prompting the need for repentance (tawbah).

3. **Transgression (Tughyan or I'tidaa)**: Transgression can be interpreted as an extreme form of disobedience, where an individual not only disobeys but goes beyond the limits set by Allah. This concept can also encompass broader actions that harm others or oneself, reflecting a disregard for moral and ethical boundaries. In this sense, transgression is a violation not only of divine laws but also of social justice and personal responsibility.

In summary, transgression can be seen as a serious extension of sin and disobedience, indicating a failure to recognize and respect the limits set by Allah. Muslims are encouraged to seek forgiveness and strive for righteousness by adhering to the teachings of the Qur'an and Sunnah, thus avoiding transgression and its consequences in both this life and the Hereafter. Seeking guidance through prayer, reflection, and the company of the righteous can help individuals stay on the path of obedience and away from transgression.
