The definitions provided are clear and demonstrate an understanding of the concepts. However, in the context of a Christian worldview, the explanation would need to emphasize the role of Christ as the ultimate solution for sin and disobedience. Additionally, incorporating the idea of grace, redemption, and forgiveness through Jesus Christ would have strengthened the answer from a Christian perspective."
