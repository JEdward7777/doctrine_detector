  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response successfully addresses the concern about understanding the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple. The writer provides several key points that explain why the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle, including the need for a permanent place of worship, fulfillment of God's promise, increased population and complexity, and historical context.\n\nThe response is well-organized and easy to follow, with each point building on the previous one to provide a clear and coherent explanation. The writer also uses relevant biblical references, such as King Solomon and the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem, to support their argument.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. For example, some of the points could be further developed or supported with more specific examples or scriptural evidence. Additionally, the summary at the end could be expanded to provide a clearer overview of the main points.\n\nOverall, I would say that this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides a clear explanation of the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple."
