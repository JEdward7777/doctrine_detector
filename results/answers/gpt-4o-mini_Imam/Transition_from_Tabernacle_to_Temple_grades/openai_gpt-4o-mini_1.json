It addresses the concern by discussing multiple key points such as the need for a permanent place of worship, fulfillment of God's promise, increased population and complexity, and historical context. The explanation is detailed and demonstrates a solid grasp of the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple from a Christian worldview."
