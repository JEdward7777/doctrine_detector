The student effectively conveys the essence of the term across languages, emphasizing God's power and sovereignty. However, to improve the answer, the student could include a brief mention of the significance of the term within Christian theology and its historical context. Additionally, ensuring consistency in the format of language translations throughout the response would enhance clarity."
