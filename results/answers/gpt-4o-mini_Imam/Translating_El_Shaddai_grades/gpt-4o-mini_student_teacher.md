The term "El Shaddai" is a Hebrew phrase that is often translated as "God Almighty" in many English Bible translations. This term, which appears in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament, conveys the idea of God's omnipotence and sufficiency.

When translating "El Shaddai" into other languages, the rendering may vary slightly based on cultural and linguistic contexts, but the essence of the term generally remains consistent. Here are a few translations in different languages based on common Bible translations:

1. **Spanish**: "El Shaddai" is often translated as "Dios Todopoderoso."
2. **French**: In French translations, it is typically rendered as "Dieu Tout-Puissant."
3. **German**: The phrase is often translated as "Gott der Allmächtige."
4. **Italian**: In Italian, it is commonly translated as "Dio Onnipotente."
5. **Arabic**: In Arabic translations of the Bible, it is rendered as "الله القدير" (Allah Al-Qadeer), meaning "God the All-Powerful."
6. **Portuguese**: In Portuguese, it is often translated as "Deus Todo-Poderoso."

These translations emphasize God's power and sovereignty, similar to the original Hebrew meaning. If you have a specific language in mind or wish to know more about a particular translation, please feel free to ask!

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of translations for "El Shaddai" in various languages, emphasizing the consistency of conveying God's power and sovereignty. However, the student could improve the accuracy by considering the reference answer provided by the teacher, which suggests translating it as 'God Almighty' or keeping it as 'Shaddai' when necessary for phonetic reasons. This would help ensure a more accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages.
