It correctly highlights the essence of the term as conveying God's omnipotence and sufficiency. \n\nHowever, the reference answer suggests a simpler approach for some languages, and the student's answer could have included this option. Additionally, the student could have elaborated on the variations in spelling across languages based on phonetics.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept and its translation challenges across cultures."
