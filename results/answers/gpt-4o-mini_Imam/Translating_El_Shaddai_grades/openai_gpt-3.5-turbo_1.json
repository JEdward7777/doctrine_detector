However, the concern about ensuring accuracy in representing God's name across cultures and languages could have been addressed more directly. It would have been beneficial to emphasize the importance of maintaining the significance and reverence of God's name in translations, even if the phonetics may vary. Overall, while informative, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of accurately translating divine names in different languages."
