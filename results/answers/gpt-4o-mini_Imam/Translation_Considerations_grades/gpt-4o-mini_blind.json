The explanation is clear and thorough, demonstrating an understanding of the importance of these terms. However, to enhance the Christian worldview perspective, the answer could have emphasized more the theological centrality of these terms within the context of God's redemptive plan and the fulfillment of prophecy through Jesus Christ. Additionally, connecting these terms to the broader narrative of salvation history in the Bible would have further strengthened the argument."
