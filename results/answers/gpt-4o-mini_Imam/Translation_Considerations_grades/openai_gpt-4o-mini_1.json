It effectively demonstrates how these terms carry significant spiritual and cultural meanings, aligning well with the concern of conveying the original text's significance. The only area for improvement could be to further elaborate on how these terms specifically connect to Biblical heritage and teachings in a Christian context, but overall, the response is comprehensive and insightful."
