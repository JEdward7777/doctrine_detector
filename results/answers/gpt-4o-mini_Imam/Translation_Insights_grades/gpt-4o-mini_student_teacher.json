  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as a 70. The student provides insight into Islamic concepts and translations related to the phrase \"image of God\" and makes meaningful connections to Islamic theology. However, the student's response does not directly address the significance of the suggested translations provided in the reference answer from a Christian perspective. The student could improve their answer by explicitly comparing and contrasting the Islamic translations with the Christian translations provided in the reference answer to highlight the differing theological implications."
