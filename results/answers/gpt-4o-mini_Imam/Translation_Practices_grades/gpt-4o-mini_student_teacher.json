  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer that effectively addresses the concern of maintaining reverence for God's name in Bible translations. They skillfully connected the historical Jewish tradition of avoiding pronunciation of the tetragrammaton with the use of \"LORD\" in translations for respect and clarity. The only slight deviation from the reference answer is the focus on conveying the authority and majesty of God's name in addition to the fear of mispronunciation. Overall, an excellent response demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
