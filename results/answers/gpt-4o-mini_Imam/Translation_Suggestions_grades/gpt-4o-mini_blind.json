  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid response by offering alternative translations that capture the essence of being zealous in a biblical context. The choices of words such as fervent, devoted, passionate, eager, ardent, fervid, and enthusiastic are appropriate and align well with the meaning of zeal in a religious setting. The explanation provided is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the depth of commitment and fervor associated with being zealous. Good job overall."
