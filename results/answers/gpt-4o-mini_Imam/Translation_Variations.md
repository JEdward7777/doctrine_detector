The term "covenant faithfulness" in a theological context, especially within Islam, refers to the steadfastness and loyalty that God shows toward His covenant with humanity, as well as the expectation that believers uphold their part of that covenant. While the phrase is more common in Christian theology, we can explore alternative translations or phrases that capture similar meanings in an Islamic context:

1. **Divine Loyalty** - This emphasizes God's unwavering commitment to His creation and His promises.
2. **Pledge of Faith** - This highlights the importance of fulfilling promises made, whether by God to humanity or by individuals to God.
3. **Commitment to the Covenant** - This reflects the mutual agreement between God and His followers, stressing the importance of dedication.
4. **Faithful Promise** - This phrase would convey the idea of Godâ€™s reliability in keeping His promises and the expectation of believers to trust in this fidelity.
5. **Covenantal Integrity** - This focuses on maintaining wholeness and truthfulness in the relationship established through God's covenant.
6. **Loyalty to God's Commands** - This phrase shifts the focus to the believer's side of the covenant, stressing adherence to divine guidance.

Each of these alternatives underscores the themes of loyalty, commitment, and faithfulness that are with regard to the relationship between God and His followers. In Islam, such concepts are often reflected in the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, where the emphasis is on fulfilling one's obligations and maintaining a sincere relationship with God.
