The suggested phrases capture key aspects of God's commitment and believers' responsibilities. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to Islamic theology and scripture to strengthen the argument and relevance within an Islamic framework. Additionally, tying the alternatives more directly to the specific teachings and concepts within Islam would enhance the overall coherence and depth of the analysis."
