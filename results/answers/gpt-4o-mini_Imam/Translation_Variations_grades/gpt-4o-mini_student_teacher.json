  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has made a commendable effort in exploring alternative translations for 'covenant faithfulness' within an Islamic context, highlighting key aspects of loyalty, commitment, and faithfulness. The suggested translations effectively convey similar meanings to the original term and show a deep consideration of the relationship between God and believers. While the student's response may have been further enriched by directly addressing the Christian perspective and incorporating more specific biblical references, the exploration of Islamic interpretations adds depth to the discussion."
