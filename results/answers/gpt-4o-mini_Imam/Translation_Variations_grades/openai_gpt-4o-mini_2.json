The explanations for each alternative translation are clear and demonstrate a foundational understanding of theological concepts. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more direct references to Islamic teachings or scriptures to further illustrate the parallels between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on covenant faithfulness."
