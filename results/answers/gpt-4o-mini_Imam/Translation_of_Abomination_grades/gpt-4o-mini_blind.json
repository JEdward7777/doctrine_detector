The inclusion of Arabic equivalents and the emphasis on maintaining the severity and contextual meaning of the term are commendable. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on how the term is used in specific biblical contexts and how it relates to God's holiness and righteousness. Additionally, tying in the concept of repentance and redemption through Christ could enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
