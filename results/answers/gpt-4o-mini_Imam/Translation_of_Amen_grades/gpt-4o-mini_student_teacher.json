  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nThe student provided a well-thought-out response exploring potential translations of \"truly\" in various languages and contexts, demonstrating an effort to understand the importance of accurate biblical translation. While the student's answer was comprehensive and insightful, the teacher's reference answer of \"'Yes, I tell you sincerely' or 'What I am telling you is true.'\" is more closely aligned with the specific phrase used by Jesus and may be considered a more accurate translation based on a Christian worldview. The student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing and incorporating this reference translation to strengthen their response."
