  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively explores the meaning of the term \"ark\" in different Biblical contexts, highlighting its significance in stories like Noah's Ark and the Ark of the Covenant. It acknowledges the importance of accurate translation to ensure proper interpretation of scripture and provides detailed examples to support the explanation. The only minor improvement could be a bit more explicit connection to the concern raised, but overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
