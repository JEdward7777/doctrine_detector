  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on spiritual rebirth and provides a well-reasoned explanation of how the concept of \"begotten\" does not apply in Islamic theology. The response accurately highlights the emphasis on *Tawbah* and *Imaan* in Islamic spiritual rebirth and draws a meaningful analogy between this process and a metaphorical renewal of faith and character. The student's clear explanation and consistent reference to relevant Islamic sources contribute to the overall strength of the answer."
