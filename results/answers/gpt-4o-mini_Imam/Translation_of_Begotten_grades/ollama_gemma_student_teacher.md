## [Answer](../Translation_of_Begotten.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, the concept of "begotten" is not used in the same way it might be understood in some other religious contexts, particularly in relation to the nature of God or the relationship between God and Jesus. In Islam, God (Allah) is described as unique and is not considered to have a son or to beget in the human sense. The Qur'an emphasizes the oneness and transcendence of God, as stated in Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112), which declares:

> "Say, 'He is Allah, [Who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent.'"

When discussing spiritual rebirth in Islam, the focus is on the concept of *Tawbah* (repentance) and *Imaan* (faith). Spiritual rebirth in a Muslim context refers to a profound transformation that occurs when a person sincerely repents from sin, reforms their behavior, and renews their commitment to following the guidance of Allah as revealed in the Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

The idea of renewal or rebirth in this sense can be seen as a metaphorical reawakening of one's faith and moral character, akin to a new beginning in one's spiritual journey. This rebirth is often associated with regaining a clear understanding of one's purpose, reinforcing connections to Allah through prayers, and striving to embody the values and ethics in Islam.

Therefore, rather than a literal interpretation associated with the term "begotten," Muslims understand spiritual rebirth as a guiding journey back to faith, righteousness, and a closer relationship with Allah, marked by good deeds, repentance, and striving for personal growth and obedience to divine commandments.
