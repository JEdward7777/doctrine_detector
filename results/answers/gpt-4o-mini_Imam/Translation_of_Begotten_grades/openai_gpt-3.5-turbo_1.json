However, the response could strengthen its focus on directly addressing the concern of clarifying the spiritual implications of being \"begotten\" for believers within the context of Islamic theology. It would be beneficial to provide a more explicit connection to how the concept of spiritual rebirth in Islam differs from the Christian perspective presented in the initial answer."
