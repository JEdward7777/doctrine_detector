However, it does not directly address the concern raised about clarifying the spiritual implications of being \"begotten\" for believers from a Christian perspective. The answer could have been improved by drawing a parallel between the concept of spiritual rebirth in Islam and in Christianity, specifically discussing the unique Christian belief in Jesus as the begotten Son of God and the significance of this relationship for Christian believers."
