However, the response does not directly address the concern of clarifying the spiritual implications of being 'begotten' for believers in an Islamic context. It would have been beneficial to specifically discuss how the Christian concept of being spiritually born again in Christ contrasts with the Islamic understanding of God's uniqueness and transcendence without begetting."
