  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided accurate translations of the term \"church\" in a Muslim context, but did not address the concern of accurately representing the inclusive nature of the church in translations. The translations given do not emphasize the idea of the church as a gathering of all believers, but rather focus on the physical place of worship. To improve their answer, the student should have included translations that reflect the church as a community of believers coming together rather than just a physical location for worship."
