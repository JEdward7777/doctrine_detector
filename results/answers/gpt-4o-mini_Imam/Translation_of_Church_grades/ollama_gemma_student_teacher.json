  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer provides accurate translations for the term \"church\" that reflect its meaning in a Muslim context. However, it could have benefited from including additional suggestions that better capture the inclusive nature of the church. The reference answer provided suggests alternatives like \"gathering together,\" \"assembly,\" or \"congregation,\" which emphasizes the broader and inclusive nature of the church. Including such options would have strengthened the student's response."
