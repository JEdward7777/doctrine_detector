  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides accurate translations of the term \"church\" in a Muslim context, taking into consideration the inclusive nature of the church by suggesting translations that refer to all believers rather than a small group. The translations provided accurately reflect the significance of the church as a place of worship for Christians. The concern regarding accurate representation of the church's inclusive nature in translations is effectively addressed with appropriate suggestions."
