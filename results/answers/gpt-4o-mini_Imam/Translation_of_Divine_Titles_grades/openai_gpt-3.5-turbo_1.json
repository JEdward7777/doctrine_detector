The translations suggested are respectful and attempt to convey the concept of divine sovereignty. However, there is a missed opportunity to emphasize the significance of God's titles and presence in Scripture within a Christian worldview. More emphasis on specifically Christian theological nuances and the importance of accurately reflecting God's nature in translations could have further enriched the response."
