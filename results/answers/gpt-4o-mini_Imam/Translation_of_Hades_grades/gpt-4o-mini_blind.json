However, the answer deviated significantly from the question, focusing on Islamic beliefs rather than providing translations that align with their biblical meanings. The emphasis should have been on the biblical definitions of \"Hades\" and \"Sheol,\" and how these terms are understood within a Christian worldview. Additionally, the response did not incorporate key Christian theological concepts such as judgment, salvation, or resurrection, which are fundamental to understanding the biblical meanings of these terms."
