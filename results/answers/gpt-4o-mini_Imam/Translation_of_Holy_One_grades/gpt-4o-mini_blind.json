The translations provided accurately convey the sanctity and significance of the term within a religious context. However, it would have been helpful to include a Christian perspective on the term \"Holy One\" and its significance within Christian theology. Additionally, citing specific biblical references or theological nuances associated with the term could have further enhanced the answer. Overall, a well-researched and informative response."
