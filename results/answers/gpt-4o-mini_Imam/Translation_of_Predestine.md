## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In an Islamic context, the term "predestined" often corresponds to the Arabic word "qadar" (قدر), which refers to the divine decree or predestination. Here are some suggested translations and related terms:

1. **Qadar (قدر)** - This is the most direct term, referring to God's knowledge and decree of all that happens.
2. **Taqdir (تقدير)** - This can be translated as predestination or divine measurement, encompassing God's plan and destiny for creation.
3. **Muqaddar (مقدّر)** - This term specifically refers to what has been decreed or predetermined by Allah.
4. **Kada wa Qadar (قضاء و قدر)** - This phrase is often used together to refer to the overarching concept of divine will and predestination.
5. **Predestination** - While this English term captures the essence, the theological implications may vary across different faith traditions.

It's important to note that in Islam, belief in qadar is a fundamental aspect of faith, encompassing the belief that Allah has knowledge of all events and that everything occurs according to His will and wisdom.
