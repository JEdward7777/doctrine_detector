  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"predestined\" within an Islamic context, offering multiple suggested translations and related terms. The inclusion of key Arabic terms such as \"Qadar\" and \"Taqdir\" demonstrates a good understanding of the concept. The answer also appropriately highlights the significance of belief in predestination in Islam. However, to improve the grade, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications and differences compared to the Christian perspective on predestination."
