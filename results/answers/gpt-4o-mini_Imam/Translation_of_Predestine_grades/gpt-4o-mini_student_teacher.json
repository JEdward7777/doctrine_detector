  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided valuable information about how the term \"predestined\" is understood in an Islamic context, offering translations and related terms in Arabic. However, the student did not specifically address biblical translations related to predestination as requested. The student's answer would have been stronger if they had included translations that are more directly related to the Christian understanding of predestination."
