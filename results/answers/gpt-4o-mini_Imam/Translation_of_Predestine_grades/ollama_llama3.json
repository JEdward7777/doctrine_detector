The original answer's translations (\"decided long ago\", \"planned ahead of time\", or \"decided beforehand\") do not accurately reflect the Islamic concept of qadar or its significance in the faith.\n\nTo achieve an accurate understanding of biblical translations related to predestination, it is essential to delve deeper into the theological context and nuances of each term. The provided response merely scratches the surface, failing to engage with the fundamental aspects of Islamic belief and the concepts surrounding qadar."
