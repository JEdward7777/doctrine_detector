  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic concept of predestination and offers translations and related terms in Arabic.

To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to include a comparison with Christian beliefs on predestination and accurately address biblical translations to meet the concern more directly."
