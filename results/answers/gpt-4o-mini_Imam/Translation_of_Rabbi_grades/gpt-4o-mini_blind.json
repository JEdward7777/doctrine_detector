  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 85.\n\nThe answer provides a comprehensive overview of the considerations that should be made when translating the term 'Rabbi' into various languages. The student demonstrates an understanding of the contextual, cultural, religious, linguistic, and historical aspects that are important in this translation process. The response is well-organized and covers a wide range of relevant points.\n\nHowever, to improve the grade, the student could have elaborated more on the doctrinal differences between the roles of a Rabbi, Imam, and Sheikh, emphasizing the distinct theological foundations of Judaism and Islam. Additionally, emphasizing the theological significance of the term 'Rabbi' within the Christian worldview could have further enriched the answer from a Christian perspective."
