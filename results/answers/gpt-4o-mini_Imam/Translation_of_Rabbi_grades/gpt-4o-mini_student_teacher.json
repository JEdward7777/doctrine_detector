  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that covers various important considerations when translating the term 'Rabbi' into different languages. They demonstrated a good understanding of the contextual, cultural, religious, and linguistic aspects involved in the translation process. However, the response did not explicitly address the concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. While the answer provided valuable insights into translation considerations, it fell short of directly connecting these considerations to ensuring an accurate representation of Jesus as more than just a schoolteacher."
