  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of important considerations for translating the term 'Rabbi' while maintaining accuracy and respect for Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith. It addresses the concern raised regarding the accurate representation of Jesus' teaching role well, highlighting the need to avoid implying Jesus was merely a schoolteacher. The response incorporates Christian worldview principles by emphasizing the significance and uniqueness of Jesus as a teacher, aligning with the concern provided. The only potential area for improvement would be to explicitly tie in Christian theological perspectives or scriptural references related to Jesus' teaching ministry to further strengthen the Christian-specific worldview aspect. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding and application of Christian principles within the context of translation considerations."
