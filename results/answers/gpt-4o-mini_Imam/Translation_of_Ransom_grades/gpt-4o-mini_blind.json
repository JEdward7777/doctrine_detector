The student appropriately addresses the importance of considering cultural nuances when translating such terms. The only area for improvement would be to include a reference to the Christian perspective of ransom as seen in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ for the redemption of humanity. This addition would have enhanced the answer from a Christian worldview standpoint."
