  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of how the term 'ransom' is translated in various languages, highlighting the common understanding of making payment for release. The emphasis on considering cultural context and nuances in translation is commendable. However, to enhance the grade further, connecting this understanding of ransom as a payment for release to theological significance within Christian doctrine would have made the response stronger in addressing the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts."
