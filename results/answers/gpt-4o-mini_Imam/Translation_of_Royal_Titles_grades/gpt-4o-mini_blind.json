However, the answer could be improved by incorporating a Christian perspective on royalty and honor, highlighting biblical principles of respect and submission to authority. Additionally, some languages, especially those with Christian historical influences, may have specific terms or cultural practices related to addressing royalty that could have been included for a more holistic perspective."
