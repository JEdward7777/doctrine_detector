However, the concern specified ensuring accuracy and respect in translations in the context of biblical teachings. The reference answer from the teacher suggests translating as 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' focusing on maintaining respect while addressing rulers. While the student's answer is informative and well-researched, it lacks a direct connection to biblical teachings or emphasis on maintaining a respectful tone in translations, which is essential in the context of biblical principles."
