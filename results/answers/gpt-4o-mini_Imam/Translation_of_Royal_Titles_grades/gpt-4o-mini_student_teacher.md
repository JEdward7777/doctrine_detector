The phrase "Your Majesty," used to address kings, queens, or royal figures, can be translated into various languages, reflecting the cultural and linguistic nuances of addressing royalty. Here are a few translations:

1. **Arabic:** جلالتك (Jalālatuk) - used for addressing kings and queens.
2. **Spanish:** Su Majestad - commonly used in Spanish-speaking countries.
3. **French:** Votre Majesté - the formal way to address royalty in French.
4. **German:** Seine/ Ihre Majestät - "Seine" for kings (his) and "Ihre" for queens (her).
5. **Italian:** Sua Maestà - used in Italy.
6. **Russian:** Его/Её Величество (Yego/Yeyo Velichestvo) - "His/Her Majesty."
7. **Chinese (Mandarin):** 陛下 (Bìxià) - used to address emperors or empresses.

These translations maintain the sense of respect and honor appropriate for speaking to someone of royal status. Each language has its own context and historical background that shapes these forms of address.

Comment: 
The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for "Your Majesty" in different languages, demonstrating a good understanding of cultural and linguistic nuances. However, the concern specified ensuring accuracy and respect in translations in the context of biblical teachings. The reference answer from the teacher suggests translating as 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' focusing on maintaining respect while addressing rulers. While the student's answer is informative and well-researched, it lacks a direct connection to biblical teachings or emphasis on maintaining a respectful tone in translations, which is essential in the context of biblical principles.
