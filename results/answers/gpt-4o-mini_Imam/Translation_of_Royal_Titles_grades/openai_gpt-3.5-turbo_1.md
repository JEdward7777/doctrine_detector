1. **Arabic:** جلالتك (Jalālatuk) - used for addressing kings and queens.
2. **Spanish:** Su Majestad - commonly used in Spanish-speaking countries.
3. **French:** Votre Majesté - the formal way to address royalty in French.
4. **German:** Seine/ Ihre Majestät - "Seine" for kings (his) and "Ihre" for queens (her).
5. **Italian:** Sua Maestà - used in Italy.
6. **Russian:** Его/Её Величество (Yego/Yeyo Velichestvo) - "His/Her Majesty."
7. **Chinese (Mandarin):** 陛下 (Bìxià) - used to address emperors or empresses.

These translations maintain the sense of respect and honor appropriate for speaking to someone of royal status. Each language has its own context and historical background that shapes these forms of address.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for "Your Majesty" in different languages, demonstrating a good understanding of how cultural nuances impact forms of address. The emphasis on maintaining respect and honor in addressing royalty aligns well with biblical teachings on honoring authority figures. However, it could have been improved by explicitly connecting the translations to biblical principles of respect and honor towards rulers.
