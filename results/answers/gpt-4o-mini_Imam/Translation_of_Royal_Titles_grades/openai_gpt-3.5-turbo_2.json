  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and accurate list of translations for the phrase \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, demonstrating cultural respect and honor towards royalty. The concern regarding accurate and respectful translations aligns well with the context of biblical teachings that emphasize showing respect to authority figures. The response could be improved by explicitly connecting these translations to biblical teachings on honoring authority, but overall, it offers a comprehensive and well-informed perspective from a Christian worldview."
