The phrase "Your Majesty," used to address kings, queens, or royal figures, can be translated into various languages, reflecting the cultural and linguistic nuances of addressing royalty. Here are a few translations:

1. **Arabic:** جلالتك (Jalālatuk) - used for addressing kings and queens.
2. **Spanish:** Su Majestad - commonly used in Spanish-speaking countries.
3. **French:** Votre Majesté - the formal way to address royalty in French.
4. **German:** Seine/ Ihre Majestät - "Seine" for kings (his) and "Ihre" for queens (her).
5. **Italian:** Sua Maestà - used in Italy.
6. **Russian:** Его/Её Величество (Yego/Yeyo Velichestvo) - "His/Her Majesty."
7. **Chinese (Mandarin):** 陛下 (Bìxià) - used to address emperors or empresses.

These translations maintain the sense of respect and honor appropriate for speaking to someone of royal status. Each language has its own context and historical background that shapes these forms of address.
