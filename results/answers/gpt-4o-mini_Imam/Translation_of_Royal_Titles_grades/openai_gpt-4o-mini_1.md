1. **Arabic:** جلالتك (Jalālatuk) - used for addressing kings and queens.
2. **Spanish:** Su Majestad - commonly used in Spanish-speaking countries.
3. **French:** Votre Majesté - the formal way to address royalty in French.
4. **German:** Seine/ Ihre Majestät - "Seine" for kings (his) and "Ihre" for queens (her).
