  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, showcasing cultural and linguistic nuances in addressing royalty. It demonstrates a respectful approach to translations of titles, which aligns with biblical teachings on honoring authority and showing respect to leaders. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly connect the importance of respectful translations to Christian values, but overall, the response is accurate and thoughtful."
