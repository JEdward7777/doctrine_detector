  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful explanation of how the term 'saints' can be translated in the context of Islamic teachings, emphasizing the Arabic term \"\u0623\u0648\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0621\" (Awliya) and the concept of closeness to Allah. However, the answer does not directly address the question of recommending a way to translate the term 'saints'. Additionally, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to note the doctrinal differences in the understanding of saints between Islam and Christianity. The response could benefit from clearer relevance to the specific question and a more thorough examination of the term 'saints' in light of Christian beliefs."
