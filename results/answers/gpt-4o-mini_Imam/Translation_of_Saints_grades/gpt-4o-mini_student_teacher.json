  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not address the specific concern provided in the prompt regarding the use of inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Christ without referencing specific Christian groups. The student's response focuses on Islamic teachings and terminology, which is not relevant to the question asked. Additionally, the student does not provide a recommended way to translate the term 'saints' in a Christian context. The answer lacks relevance and does not align with the Christian specific worldview required in this scenario."
