  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concern for inclusive language. They provide a accurate translation of the Islamic term 'saints' and explain its conceptual differences from other religious traditions. The response is well-written and demonstrates research and sensitivity to the Islamic perspective. However, it would benefit from including additional examples or references to support the translation and conceptual understanding of sainthood in Islam."
