The concern is not fully addressed, as the response still uses language that is specific to Christianity (\"holy ones,\" \"holy people,\" and \"holy believers in Jesus\"). Additionally, the response does not demonstrate a thorough understanding of Islamic teachings or traditions regarding saints (Awliya). To improve, the response could have focused on exploring the concept of Awliya within Islamic teachings without referencing Christian-specific language."
