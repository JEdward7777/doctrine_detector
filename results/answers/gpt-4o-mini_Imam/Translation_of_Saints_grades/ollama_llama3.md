## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Islamic teachings, the term 'saints' can be translated to Arabic as "أولياء" (Awliya), which refers to those who are close to Allah and are recognized for their piety and righteousness. These individuals may not be saints in the same sense as in other religious traditions, but they are often revered for their strong faith, moral integrity, and significant contributions to the community.

It is important to approach this term with the understanding that in Islam, all believers are encouraged to strive for righteousness and closeness to Allah, and the concept of sainthood differs from some other faiths. Instead, we focus on the qualities that make one beloved to Allah, such as devotion, humility, and service to others.

Grade: 40

Comment: While the response does attempt to engage with the concept of "saints" from an Islamic perspective, it falls short in terms of accurately representing all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The concern is not fully addressed, as the response still uses language that is specific to Christianity ("holy ones," "holy people," and "holy believers in Jesus"). Additionally, the response does not demonstrate a thorough understanding of Islamic teachings or traditions regarding saints (Awliya). To improve, the response could have focused on exploring the concept of Awliya within Islamic teachings without referencing Christian-specific language.
