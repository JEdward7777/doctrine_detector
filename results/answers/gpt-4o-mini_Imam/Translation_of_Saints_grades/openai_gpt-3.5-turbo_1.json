  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the term 'saints' within Islamic teachings and emphasizes the qualities that are valued in Islam. The mention of striving for righteousness and closeness to Allah aligns with Christian values of moral integrity and devotion to God. The response effectively bridges the understanding between Islamic and Christian perspectives on the concept of saints, focusing on common principles rather than differences. The only minor concern is that the response could have explicitly mentioned the term 'saints' in the Arabic translation to connect it more directly with the concept in Islam."
