  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 60.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed exploration of translating the term 'sanctuary' in a Muslim context, they miss the specific concern of ensuring the accurate translation of Biblical terms. The student does not address the importance of maintaining the original meaning of 'sanctuary' as a holy and sacred place in the Bible. Additionally, the response focuses more on cultural and contextual considerations in a Muslim context rather than the specific concern of maintaining the original Biblical meaning. The student does not sufficiently engage with the Christian-specific worldview in addressing the translation of 'sanctuary'.\n\nIn order to improve their grade, the student should have included more emphasis on understanding and preserving the theological significance of 'sanctuary' as portrayed in the Bible when translating it in modern texts."
