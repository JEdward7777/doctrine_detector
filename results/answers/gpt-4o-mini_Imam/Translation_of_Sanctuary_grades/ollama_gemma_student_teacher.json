  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concern and provides thoughtful and relevant considerations for translating the term \"sanctuary\" in a Muslim context. The student acknowledges the cultural and religious significance of the term, as well as the importance of context and sensitivity when translating it. The inclusion of suggestions for using classical Arabic terms and consulting scholarly sources demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the subject matter. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on how to reconcile the translation of \"sanctuary\" in a Muslim context with its biblical definition."
