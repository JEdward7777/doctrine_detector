The concern specified was ensuring proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms to maintain their original meaning. While this response does address that concern, it only scratches the surface of considering how different cultures and religious contexts might interpret \"sanctuary\". A more comprehensive approach would involve exploring how other faiths, including Islam, understand and use the term \"sanctuary\", which is not fully addressed in this response."
