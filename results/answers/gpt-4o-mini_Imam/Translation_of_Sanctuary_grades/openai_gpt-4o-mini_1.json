The emphasis on maintaining accuracy and respect in translation is commendable. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of maintaining the original biblical definition of 'sanctuary' when translating it in different contexts. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of translation principles within a Christian worldview."
