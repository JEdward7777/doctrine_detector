It addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of accuracy and reverence in translations, aligning well with a Christian worldview focused on preserving the integrity of sacred terminology. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly tie in the translation of 'sanctuary' in the Muslim context with the responsibility of maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms, to strengthen the connection between the two perspectives."
