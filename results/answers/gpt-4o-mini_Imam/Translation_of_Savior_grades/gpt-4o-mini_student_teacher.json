  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70.\n\nThe student provides a detailed and well-thought-out response focusing on the implications of the term 'Savior' in Islamic theology. They effectively highlight important aspects such as Divine Mercy, spiritual salvation, deliverance from oppression, community support, and trust in Allah. \n\nHowever, the student strayed from the initial question, which asked about the implications of translating the term 'Savior' as 'the One who saves' or 'who rescues from enemies'. They focused more on the broader theological implications within Islam rather than specifically addressing the translation nuances. \n\nWhile the content is insightful and well-articulated, the answer would have been stronger if it directly addressed the prescribed concern."
