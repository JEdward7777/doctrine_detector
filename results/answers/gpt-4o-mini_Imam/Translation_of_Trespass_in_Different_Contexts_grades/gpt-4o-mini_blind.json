  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured explanation of the implications of translating 'trespass' as 'sin' or 'breaking the rule' within an Islamic context. They have effectively discussed the concepts of sin, trespass, and breaking the rule, and have linked them to community dynamics with clarity. The answer is informative and demonstrates an understanding of Islamic teachings on interpersonal relationships. However, the response could have been strengthened by incorporating more specific references to Islamic scriptures or teachings to support the points made, which would have enhanced doctrinal correctness."
