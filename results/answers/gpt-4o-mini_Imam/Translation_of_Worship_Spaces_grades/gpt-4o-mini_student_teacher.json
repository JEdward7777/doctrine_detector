  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: While the student made a thoughtful attempt at providing a contemporary translation for \"house of Yahweh\" by considering the Islamic perspective, there are concerns regarding accuracy and maintaining the theological significance of the original phrase. The student should focus more on conveying the presence of Yahweh in the translation, as suggested in the reference answer. Additionally, the emphasis on fostering interfaith dialogue, while admirable, detracts from the primary concern of accurately conveying the meaning and importance of worship spaces in the translation."
