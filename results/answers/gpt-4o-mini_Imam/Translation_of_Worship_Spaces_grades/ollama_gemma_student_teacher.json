  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the original meaning of \"house of Yahweh\" and its relevance to contemporary audiences. The comparison between the concepts of worship in Islam and Judaism is insightful, and the emphasis on interfaith dialogue is commendable. While the suggested translation of \"House of Allah\" is appropriate for Muslim audiences, it might not fully capture the uniqueness of the original phrase within Christianity. Nonetheless, the overall approach and clarity of the response justify a high grade."
