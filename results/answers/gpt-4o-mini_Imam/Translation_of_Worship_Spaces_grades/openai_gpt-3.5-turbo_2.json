The suggested translation as \"House of Allah\" for a Muslim audience is well reasoned and respects the sacredness of the original phrase. However, the response could further emphasize the importance of accurately conveying the significance of worship spaces without potentially diluting the original meaning. Integrating more specific references to the Christian understanding of Yahweh's presence in His temple could strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
