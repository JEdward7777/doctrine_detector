In a biblical context, the phrase "You must call his name" can be found in various translations and could be expressed differently depending on the specific version of the Bible. A few alternative translations or paraphrases might include:

1. "You shall name him"
2. "You are to give him the name"
3. "You will call his name"
4. "You will name him"
5. "You should designate his name"

Different translations of the Bible may use different wording based on their translation philosophy, whether formal equivalence (word-for-word) or dynamic equivalence (thought-for-thought). It is important to look at the context in which this phrase appears, as it often relates to significant figures in biblical narratives, such as the naming of Jesus or other prophetic figures. For instance, the phrase is notably found in Matthew 1:21, regarding the naming of Jesus.
