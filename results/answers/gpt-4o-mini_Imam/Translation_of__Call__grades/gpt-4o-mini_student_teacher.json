  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90. The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response, demonstrating a good understanding of the nuances of biblical language and translation variations. They offered a variety of alternative translations and explained the significance of context in interpreting biblical phrases. Additionally, they referenced a specific biblical verse (Matthew 1:21) to illustrate their point. The only minor improvement could be providing a more direct and concise translation similar to the given answer, such as 'you must name him,' without additional paraphrasing. Overall, it was a well-informed and well-rounded answer."
