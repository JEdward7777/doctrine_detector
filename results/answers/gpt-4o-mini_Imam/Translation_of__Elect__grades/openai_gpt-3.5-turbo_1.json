The explanation effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God, drawing on specific examples and discussing the nuances between older and modern translations. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more direct biblical references or examples to strengthen the argument further."
