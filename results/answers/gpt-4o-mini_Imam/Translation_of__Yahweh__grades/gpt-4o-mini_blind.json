It covers reverence, tradition, theological considerations, and linguistic clarity effectively. The only improvement would be to emphasize more explicitly that the use of \"LORD\" is also rooted in a desire to avoid potentially mispronouncing the sacred name of God, as this is a significant factor in the decision."
