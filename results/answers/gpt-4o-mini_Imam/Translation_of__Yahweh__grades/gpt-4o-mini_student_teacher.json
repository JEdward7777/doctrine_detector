  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-detailed explanation of the reasons behind churches preferring \"LORD\" over \"Yahweh\" in translations. They have effectively highlighted aspects of reverence, tradition, theological considerations, and linguistic clarity. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of maintaining traditional translation practices in line with the original Hebrew text for congregational accessibility, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and informative response."
