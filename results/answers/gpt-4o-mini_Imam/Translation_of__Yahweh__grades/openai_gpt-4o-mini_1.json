  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned explanation for why some churches prefer using 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' based on tradition, reverence, and theological considerations. It effectively addresses the concern about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices by highlighting the significance of maintaining respect for the original Hebrew text while also making it accessible to congregations. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on this issue."
