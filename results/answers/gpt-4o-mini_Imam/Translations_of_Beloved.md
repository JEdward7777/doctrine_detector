The term "beloved" can be translated into Arabic and other languages with various nuances that convey affection, endearment, and deep emotional attachment, particularly within the context of love. Here are some suggestions for translations:

1. **حبيبي (Habibi)** - This is a common Arabic term meaning "my beloved" or "my dear," often used among friends and family to express affection.

2. **عزيزي (Azizi)** - Translates to "my dear" and implies a sense of cherished connection.

3. **محبوب (Mahboub)** - This means "beloved" or "one who is loved," often used in a more romantic context.

4. **شخص عزيز (Shakhs Aziz)** - This translates to "dear person" and conveys a sense of closeness.

5. **طرحة (Tahrirah)** - In poetic contexts, this term can refer to a beloved one, often used in literature and romantic expressions.

In a more spiritual context, particularly in relation to the love of Allah or prophets, you might also consider terms like:

6. **صديق (Sadiq)** - While it means "friend," it can also convey a deep love rooted in companionship.

7. **محبة (Mawhabah)** - This refers to "love" or "affection" in a more abstract sense and is often used in discussing divine love.

8. **أحباء (Ahibba)** - This is the plural form meaning "lovers" or "friends" and conveys a sense of collective love.

When selecting a term, consider the specific context in which you want to express "beloved," whether it's romantic, familial, or spiritual, as each term carries its own connotations and depth of meaning.
