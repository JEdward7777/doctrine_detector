  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive list of translation suggestions for the term \"beloved\" in different contexts, including both romantic and spiritual connotations. The student demonstrates an understanding of the nuances and cultural implications of each translation option. However, to improve the grade, it would be beneficial to include a brief explanation of how the chosen Arabic terms specifically reflect the context of love to deepen the analysis and tie it back to the concept of \"beloved\" more explicitly."
