  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed comparison between worshiping God in the Islamic context and worshiping false gods, highlighting key differences in beliefs, sources of guidance, and purposes. While the answer demonstrates understanding of the topic, it lacks integration of a Christian worldview perspective and does not directly address the concern provided. A stronger connection to the Christian faith and the distinction between worship of the one true God and worship of false gods as exemplified by Biblical teachings would have improved the answer."
