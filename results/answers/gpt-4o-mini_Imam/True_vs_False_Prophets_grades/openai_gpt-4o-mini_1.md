## [Answer](../True_vs_False_Prophets.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
Distinguishing between a true prophet of God and a false prophet is a significant matter in Islam and requires careful consideration of various criteria. Here are some fundamental points to keep in mind:

1. **Adherence to Monotheism (Tawhid)**: A true prophet will always emphasize the oneness of God (Allah) and call people to worship Him alone. If someoneâ€™s teachings lead to polytheism or divert worship away from Allah, they should be viewed with suspicion.

2. **Alignment with Previous Revelations**: A true prophet's message will be consistent with the core teachings of previous prophets and scriptures, especially the Qur'an. The Qur'an itself acknowledges previous prophets such as Moses, Jesus, and Abraham (peace be upon them). If someone claims prophethood and contradicts what has already been revealed, they may not be a true prophet.

3. **Moral Character**: The character of a prophet is essential. True prophets exemplify high moral standards, honesty, and integrity. Their life will reflect the values they preach. In Islam, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is described as Al-Amin (the trustworthy), and his character is often the yardstick by which others are measured.

4. **Fulfillment of Prophecies**: A true prophet may make predictions or statements that come to pass as part of their divine mission. However, one must exercise caution, as not all statements of potential prophecies are definitive evidence of prophethood. 

5. **Miracles as Signs**: While not a requirement, true prophets may be given miracles or signs as evidence of their prophethood. However, the focus should remain on the message rather than merely the miraculous events.

6. **Impact of the Message**: The guidance provided by a prophet should lead to positive change and upliftment in the lives of individuals and communities, fostering justice, compassion, and morality.

7. **Community Recognition**: Historically, true prophets are acknowledged by their communities over time, despite facing initial resistance or disbelief.

8. **Consistency of Message**: The teachings of a true prophet will remain steadfast and unchanging, even in the face of challenges, while false prophets might change their messages based on societal shifts or personal gain.

In conclusion, one must approach the subject of prophecy with a critical mind, relying on Islamic teachings and principles. Consulting knowledgeable scholars and seeking community consensus can also provide guidance when grappling with claims of prophecy. Ultimately, sincere reflection, prayer, and seeking knowledge from reliable sources can help discern the truth.
