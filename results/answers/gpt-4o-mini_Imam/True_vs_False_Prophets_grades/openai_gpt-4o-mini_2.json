The emphasis on relying on Islamic teachings and principles, consulting scholars, and seeking community consensus aligns well with a Christian worldview that values discernment and seeking guidance from God's Word. However, the response could have explicitly referenced Jesus Christ as the ultimate standard for prophetic legitimacy in the context of a Christian-specific worldview."
