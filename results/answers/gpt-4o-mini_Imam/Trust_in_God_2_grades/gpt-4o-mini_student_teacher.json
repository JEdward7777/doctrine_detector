  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while informative about the differences between Islamic and Christian views on Jesus, does not directly address the foundation of Christian faith in relation to trust. The core Christian teaching of trusting in Jesus as the Son of God who died for our sins is not clearly articulated in the student's answer. The focus should have been on explaining the specific Christian belief of trust in Jesus according to the reference answer provided."
