  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided by the Muslim Imam accurately contrasts the Islamic view of Jesus with the Christian view presented in the given answer regarding trust in Jesus. The emphasis on Islamic beliefs about Jesus as a prophet and the importance of trust in God alone aligns with the concern, highlighting differing foundational beliefs between Islam and Christianity. However, the grade is lower as the response does not fully engage with the Christian perspective on trust in Jesus, particularly in terms of His divinity, death, and resurrection as central to Christian faith."
