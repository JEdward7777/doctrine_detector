The response should have delved deeper into the concept of trust in Jesus within a Christian worldview, emphasizing the inseparable link between trust, belief in Jesus as the Son of God, His sacrificial death, and salvation through Him. More emphasis on the centrality of trust in the deity of Jesus and His salvific work in Christian faith would have been beneficial for a more comprehensive comparison in light of the concern provided."
