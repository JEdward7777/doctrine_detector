  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful comparison between having hope in God versus merely wishing for something from a Muslim perspective. They effectively highlighted the importance of faith, action, acceptance of divine will, sustenance, and community in relation to hope. However, the student's response focused more on the Islamic perspective rather than a Christian worldview, which was the specified concern in this grading scenario. To improve the grade, the student should have tailored their explanation to a Christian perspective, referencing Biblical principles and teachings on hope, rather than solely focusing on Islamic beliefs."
