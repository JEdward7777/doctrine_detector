  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and comprehensive explanation from a Muslim perspective on the concept of hope in God versus mere wishing. It effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the distinctions between hope as a confident expectation rooted in faith and wishful thinking lacking a foundation in trust and action. The response is well-structured, clear, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic within a Muslim worldview."
