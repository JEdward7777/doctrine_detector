  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 60. \n\nWhile the student provides a thorough explanation of love within an Islamic context, they fail to directly address the question, which specifically asks about how different forms of love, such as brotherly love and romantic love, fit into the biblical definition of love. The student acknowledges their focus on Islamic teachings, but to fully answer the question, they could have made an effort to compare and contrast Islamic perspectives on love with biblical perspectives. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, the absence of Jesus Christ as the central figure in understanding love is a significant oversight. The response could have also benefited from referencing biblical verses or teachings about different forms of love to strengthen the connection to the question."
