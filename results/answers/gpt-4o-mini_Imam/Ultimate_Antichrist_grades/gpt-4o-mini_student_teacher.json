  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer discussing the identification of the ultimate antichrist with the Beast in Revelation 13 and even included information on the Dajjal from Islamic eschatology. However, the student could have focused more directly on the specific identification of the Beast as the ultimate antichrist in the Christian tradition, aligning more closely with the provided reference answer. Despite this slight deviation, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and engaged with relevant theological parallels."
