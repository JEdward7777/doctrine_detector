It shows awareness of eschatological figures and their significance in helping Christians prepare for challenges they may face in their faith. The mention of the Dajjal in Islamic eschatology adds a comparative insight, although the emphasis remains on the Christian perspective throughout the response. A well-rounded understanding of eschatological figures within a Christian worldview."
