## [Answer](../Ultimate_Antichrist.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Christian tradition, the ultimate antichrist is often identified with the figure known as the "Beast" in the Book of Revelation, specifically Revelation 13. This figure is depicted as a symbol of opposition to Christ and is associated with deception, persecution, and chaos. The term "antichrist" itself is not explicitly used in Revelation, but it refers to a spirit of opposition to Christ that can manifest in various forms.

In Islamic eschatology, there is a figure known as the Dajjal, who is sometimes compared to the antichrist in Christian theology. The Dajjal is described as a deceiver who will appear before the Day of Judgment, leading people astray and claiming divinity. Muslims believe that Isa (Jesus) will return to confront him.

It's important to note that interpretations of these figures vary widely within both traditions, and there are rich theological discussions surrounding them.
