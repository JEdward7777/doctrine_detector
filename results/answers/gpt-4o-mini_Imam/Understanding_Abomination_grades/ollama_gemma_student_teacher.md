In a Muslim context, itâ€™s important to recognize that we believe in many of the same prophets and figures found in the Bible, including their teachings. However, the Quran provides guidance on what is considered pleasing to God (Allah) and what is not.

In the Bible, various actions are identified as abominations to God. Some examples include:

1. **Idolatry**: Worshiping idols or foreign gods is viewed as a significant transgression. In both the Bible and Quran, this is condemned as it goes against the tenet of monotheism.

2. **Homosexual Practices**: Certain passages in the Bible explicitly speak against homosexual acts. This is viewed as contrary to the natural order established by God.

3. **Divination and Sorcery**: Practices like witchcraft, fortune-telling, and other forms of divination are deemed abominable, as they contravene trust in God's plan.

4. **Dishonesty and Deceit**: Engaging in falsehood, deceit, and corrupt practices is condemned. This includes practices like fraudulent business dealings.

5. **Child Sacrifice**: Any act of sacrificing children or participating in such rituals is considered profoundly abhorrent.

6. **Consuming Certain Foods**: There are dietary laws that specify which foods are permissible and which are abominable, often referring to the consumption of certain animals like pigs.

7. **Injustice and Oppression**: Social injustices such as exploitation of the poor or corrupt legal practices are denounced.

Although these examples come from the Biblical context, in Islam, similar principles apply concerning actions that are deemed sinful or against the will of Allah. Muslims are encouraged to follow the guidance of the Quran and Hadith to lead a life aligned with His commands, emphasizing justice, honesty, monotheism, and compassion.
