  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation of the consequences of adultery according to the Bible. They effectively highlighted the moral, spiritual, community, social, emotional, relational, and eternal consequences associated with adultery, supported by relevant Biblical references. The emphasis on repentance, forgiveness, and God's mercy was also appropriately included. Overall, this response aligns well with a Christian worldview and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. Great job!"
