  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that addresses the moral, spiritual, community, social, emotional, relational, and eternal consequences of adultery as outlined in the Bible. The student effectively references relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments to support their points. However, the student could have focused more on the impact of adultery specifically on marriage and spirituality as per the concern provided. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful response from a Christian worldview."
