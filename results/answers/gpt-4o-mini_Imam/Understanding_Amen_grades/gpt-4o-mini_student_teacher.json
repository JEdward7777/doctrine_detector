  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides some relevant information about the term \"amen\" and its usage in prayers, there is a significant concern from a Christian perspective. The response focuses more on the Islamic context and the belief in Allah, rather than addressing the significance of prayer within a Christian practice. To improve the grade, the student could have integrated Christian teachings and beliefs related to prayer and how the term \"amen\" is used within that specific context."
