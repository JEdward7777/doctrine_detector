It accurately explains that the term signifies affirmation and agreement, and provides a theological foundation for its use in prayer. However, the answer is primarily focused on the Muslim context, which does not fully address the concern related to Christian practice. Including a brief explanation of its significance in Christian traditions would strengthen the overall response."
