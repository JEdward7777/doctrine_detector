  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the significance of the term \"amen\" in a Muslim context, emphasizing its role in expressing agreement with prayers and a desire for them to be fulfilled by Allah. However, the concern specified that understanding the significance of prayer in Christian practice is needed, which was not directly addressed in the response. Therefore, while the explanation is informative and well-written, it does not fully align with the Christian worldview regarding prayer."
