  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a clear and concise definition of the phrase \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context.\n* References relevant biblical passages to support the claim.\n* Acknowledges the differing interpretations of the concept among Christian denominations.\n* Offers a well-rounded explanation of the relationship between divine sovereignty and individual responsibility in salvation.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Lacks emphasis on the role of faith as a necessary component of salvation.\n* Does not delve into the theological debates surrounding predestination and its implications.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could strengthen their response by elaborating on the role of faith alongside divine appointment in receiving eternal life.\n* They could also address the concern of divine selection and grace by clarifying how God's love and grace remain available to all, regardless of predestination.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of \"appointed to eternal life\" from a Christian perspective. However, incorporating the mentioned areas of improvement would elevate the quality of the response to a higher level."
