  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and well-explained differentiation between believing in something and believing someone within the context of religious belief, particularly in Islam. The explanation is coherent and accurately reflects the nuances of faith and trust. However, to improve the response, the student could have further emphasized the importance of discernment and discerning the veracity of both beliefs, especially when it comes to beliefs in someone like a prophet. Additionally, tying in the concept of faith (Iman) and how it relates to these beliefs would strengthen the theological depth of the response."
