## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the biblical context, particularly within the narratives of the New Testament, the phrase "His name is called John" refers specifically to the name given to John the Baptist, a significant figure who is known for his role in preparing the way for Jesus (known as Isa in Islam). The naming of John is noteworthy for several reasons:

1. **Divine Instruction**: In the Gospel of Luke (1:13), an angel tells Zechariah, John the Baptist's father, that his son should be named John. This signifies that the name was chosen by divine will, which is a common practice in biblical contexts where names indicate purpose or character.

2. **Meaning of the Name**: The name "John" (which means "Yahweh is gracious") reflects the theme of God's grace and mercy that permeates the birth and ministry of John the Baptist. It can represent the blessings that accompany his role as a prophet.

3. **Significance of Naming**: In biblical times, names held significant meaning and were often seen as prophetic or indicative of a person's destiny. For instance, the act of naming John symbolizes his unique mission to call people to repentance and prepare their hearts for the coming of Jesus.

In summary, "His name is called John" signifies not only a particular individual but also carries deeper implications about God's plan, grace, and the prophetic mission assigned to John the Baptist within the Christian tradition. While Muslims honor Jesus and John the Baptist, recognizing their importance as prophets, they interpret their roles within the context of Islamic beliefs.
