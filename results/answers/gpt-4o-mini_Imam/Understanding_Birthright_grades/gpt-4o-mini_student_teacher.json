  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed analysis of the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob, covering aspects such as loss of birthright for Esau and acquisition of it for Jacob, as well as the broader spiritual significance and legacy consequences. However, the inclusion of Islamic teachings in the discussion deviated from the Christian-specific worldview requested in the concern. Additionally, the student's answer lacked a clear focus on the spiritual consequences within a Christian context as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. The response would have been stronger with a more explicit connection to the spiritual implications from a Christian perspective."
