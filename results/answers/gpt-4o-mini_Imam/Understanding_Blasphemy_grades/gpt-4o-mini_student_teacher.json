  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response exploring the Islamic perspective on blasphemy and speaking ill of others, drawing parallels with the Christian understanding. However, the concern specifically asked for a Christian worldview on the biblical implications of blasphemy, which the student did not fully address. While the student made some connections between the two faiths, a more direct application of Christian teachings on blasphemy would have been more appropriate."
