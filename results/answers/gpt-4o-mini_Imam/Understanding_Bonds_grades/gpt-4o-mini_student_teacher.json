  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of 'bonds' in a religious context. However, the answer primarily focused on Islamic teachings and did not sufficiently address the Biblical concept of 'bonds' and its implications for our spiritual obligations and relationship with God. The student could have strengthened their answer by including more examples and references from the Bible to support their points."
