The integration of relevant Biblical and Quranic references, as well as the discussion on how these bonds create a sense of community in both traditions, enriches the analysis. However, there could be a deeper exploration of the specific implications and consequences of failing to honor these commitments in both religious contexts to further strengthen the comparison."
