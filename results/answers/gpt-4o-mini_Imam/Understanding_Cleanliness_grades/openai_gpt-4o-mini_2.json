It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how the concepts of 'clean' and 'unclean' symbolize moral purity and guide believers in their personal and communal lives. The integration of key theological principles from both traditions enriches the analysis and showcases a strong understanding of the topic. Great job!"
