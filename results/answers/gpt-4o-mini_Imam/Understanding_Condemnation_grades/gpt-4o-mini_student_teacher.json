  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the verses from 1 John and Romans, highlighting the contrast between condemnation and grace in the Christian life. They correctly identified the themes of self-condemnation, God's understanding, judgment, condemnation through sin, and the free gift of justification through Jesus Christ. However, the student missed explicitly connecting the teaching that through Christ there is no condemnation for those who believe in Him, which is the key message in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to focus on emphasizing the central teachings of the Bible passages when addressing theological concepts in the future."
