  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the contrast between condemnation and grace through the references to 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16, effectively highlighting the Christian perspective on judgment, sin, and redemption. The student effectively connects the passages to the broader theological context and acknowledges the importance of seeking forgiveness and recognizing God's mercy. The response could have benefited from a deeper exploration of how salvation through Christ specifically addresses the issue of condemnation and offers a pathway to grace."
