## [Answer](../Understanding_Condemnation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the New Testament of the Bible, passages such as 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16 discuss concepts that relate to condemnation and judgment.

1. **1 John 3:20** states: "For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things." This verse suggests that human self-condemnation can occur when one feels guilty or sinful. However, it emphasizes that God understands our true nature and intentions better than we do ourselves, implying that His mercy and understanding surpass our personal feelings of worthiness or guilt.

2. **Romans 5:16** says: "And the gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned. For the judgment which came from one offense resulted in condemnation, but the free gift which came from many offenses resulted in justification." Here, the passage contrasts the concept of judgment that leads to condemnation due to Adam's sin with the grace offered through Jesus Christ, which leads to justification and forgiveness. It suggests that while sin leads to condemnation, God's grace provides an opportunity for redemption and reconciliation.

In a broader theological context, these verses work together to describe the dual aspects of humanity's condition: the reality of sin that brings about condemnation and the promise of grace that leads to forgiveness and a restored relationship with God. In Islam, similar themes exist regarding sin, repentance, and God's mercy. In both faiths, there is an emphasis on the importance of seeking forgiveness and understanding that Godâ€™s mercy is greater than human failings.
