However, the answer is slightly off in the comparison between Christian and Islamic teachings. While it is beneficial to draw similarities between religions, in discussing the consequences of cursing others specifically in the Christian context, referencing Islamic teachings was unnecessary and could potentially confuse the reader in a Christian-specific discussion. Additionally, it would have been more beneficial to delve deeper into the theological significance and implications of cursing others within the Christian perspective."
