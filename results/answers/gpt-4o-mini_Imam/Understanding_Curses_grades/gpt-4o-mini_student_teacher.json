However, the response could be improved by focusing more directly on the spiritual implications of cursing as emphasized in James 3:10, without delving too much into comparisons with Islam. The connection to the broader context of the power of the tongue and the importance of love and compassion in Christian teachings is well-addressed but could be more explicitly tied back to the specified concern."
