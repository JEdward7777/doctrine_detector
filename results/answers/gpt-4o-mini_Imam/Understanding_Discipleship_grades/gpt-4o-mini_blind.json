However, it lacks depth in explaining the centrality of repentance and surrender to Jesus as Lord in discipleship. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives, while informative, could lead to confusion or misrepresentation of core Christian doctrines in a response specifically focusing on Christian beliefs. It would have been more beneficial to delve deeper into biblical references and the significance of being born again in Christ for a more comprehensive understanding of discipleship as viewed through a Christian worldview."
