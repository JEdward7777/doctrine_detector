They made good use of relevant Bible verses to support their points. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the inherent righteousness and justice of God's judgment compared to human judgment, as emphasized in the reference answer. Additionally, the mention of the Islamic context at the end was not directly relevant to the question at hand, which slightly detracts from the overall focus of the response."
