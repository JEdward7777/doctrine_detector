## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Bible, God's judgment is portrayed as just, righteous, and all-knowing. Several passages illustrate this concept. For example, in Romans 2:6-8, it is stated that God "will repay each person according to what they have done." This emphasizes the idea that God's judgment is based on complete knowledge of human actions, intentions, and circumstances.

Additionally, Psalm 96:13 speaks of the Lord coming to judge the earth, highlighting that His judgment is not only for individuals but encompasses the entire creation. God's judgment is also described as final and unchangeable, as seen in Hebrews 9:27, which states, "it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment."

In contrast, human judgment is often flawed and influenced by personal biases, limited understanding, and imperfect perspectives. The Bible warns against this in Matthew 7:1-2, where it says, "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged." Human judgment can lead to misconceptions and unfairness due to our limited knowledge and capacity to discern the truth.

Moreover, God's judgment is deeply intertwined with mercy and grace, as illustrated in the New Testament, particularly with the concept of repentance and forgiveness. For example, in John 3:17, it states that God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. This highlights that while God has the authority to judge, His ultimate desire is for reconciliation and salvation.

In summary, God's judgment is based on complete knowledge and righteousness, while human judgment is often flawed and subjective. In the Islamic context, we also recognize that judgment belongs to Allah alone, who is all-knowledgable and just, and we are encouraged to avoid hastily judging others without understanding their circumstances.
