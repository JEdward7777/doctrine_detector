  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. It provides clear biblical examples to support its claims, including passages from Romans, Psalm, Hebrews, Matthew, and John. The response also acknowledges the importance of mercy and grace in God's judgment, as seen in the concept of repentance and forgiveness.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have delved deeper into the implications of God's perfect judgment on our understanding of human morality and ethics. Additionally, while the Islamic context is mentioned briefly, it feels somewhat tacked on and could be more integrated with the main argument.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides clear biblical support for its claims."
