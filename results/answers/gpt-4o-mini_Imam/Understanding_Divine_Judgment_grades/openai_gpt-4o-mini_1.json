  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment by citing relevant biblical passages and explaining the implications of each. The explanation provided aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the righteousness and justice of God's judgment contrasted with the limitations and biases of human judgment. The student could further strengthen the response by providing more specific examples or elaborating on the consequences of flawed human judgment in contrast to God's perfect judgment."
