## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, the term 'divine nature' refers to the attributes and characteristics of Allah (God). These attributes define His essence and are fundamental to understanding who He is. Here are some key aspects of divine nature in Islam:

1. **Oneness (Tawhid)**: The foremost characteristic of Allah is His oneness. He is unique and there is no entity comparable to Him. This concept of Tawhid emphasizes that He has no partners, associates, or equals.

2. **Eternality**: Allah is eternal and exists beyond time and space. He is not bound by the constraints of creation and has no beginning or end.

3. **All-Knowing (Al-â€˜Aleem)**: Allah possesses complete and perfect knowledge. He knows everything that has happened, is happening, and will happen.

4. **All-Powerful (Al-Qadeer)**: Allah is omnipotent; He has the power to do anything and everything that is consistent with His nature. There are no limits to His abilities.

5. **Merciful (Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim)**: Allah is inherently merciful and compassionate. His mercy encompasses all of creation, and He provides guidance and forgiveness to those who sincerely seek it.

6. **Just (Al-Adl)**: Allah is perfectly just. He does not tolerate injustice and will hold individuals accountable for their actions on the Day of Judgment.

7. **Transcendence**: Allah is beyond human comprehension and experience. His nature cannot be fully understood or interpreted by human faculties.

8. **Immanence**: While Allah is transcendent, He is also close to His creations. He is aware of everything and is present with His creation through His knowledge.

These characteristics are derived from the Qur'an and the Hadith (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). They serve as the foundation for a Muslim's understanding of God and guide them in developing a relationship with Him through worship, prayer, and living a life in accordance with His teachings.
