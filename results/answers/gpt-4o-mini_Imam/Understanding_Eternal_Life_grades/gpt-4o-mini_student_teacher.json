  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 90.\n\nThe student did an excellent job in explaining the biblical teachings on inheriting eternal life. They covered key aspects such as faith in Jesus, obedience to God's commands, the balance between grace and works, and the importance of living a life of faith. They provided relevant scripture references and connected them to Christian beliefs effectively. The only minor aspect to consider is that the student could have directly addressed the concern raised by stating explicitly that obeying God's laws and having faith in Him are essential for inheriting eternal life, similar to the reference answer. Nevertheless, overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
