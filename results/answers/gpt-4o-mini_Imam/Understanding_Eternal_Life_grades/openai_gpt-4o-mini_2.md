## [Answer](../Understanding_Eternal_Life.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The Bible teaches about inheriting eternal life primarily through the teachings of Jesus and the writings of the New Testament. According to Christian beliefs, eternal life is a gift from God that can be attained through faith in Jesus Christ.

1. **Faith in Jesus**: Jesus emphasized the importance of believing in Him for eternal life. For instance, in the Gospel of John, Jesus states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16).

2. **Obedience to God's Commands**: In the Gospels, Jesus also highlights that eternal life is connected to following God's commandments. In the parable of the rich young ruler, when asked what he must do to inherit eternal life, Jesus replies by discussing the importance of keeping the commandments (Mark 10:17-21).

3. **Grace and Works**: The New Testament teaches that eternal life is ultimately a gift of God's grace, not something that can be earned by works alone. The Apostle Paul emphasizes this in Ephesians 2:8-9, where he writes, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast."

4. **Living a Life of Faith**: The teachings of Jesus and the apostles encourage believers to live out their faith through love, service, and good works as a response to Godâ€™s grace, which reflects their commitment and relationship with Him.

In summary, the Bible teaches that eternal life is inherited through faith in Jesus Christ, adherence to God's commands, and a life transformed by grace. This understanding emphasizes a relationship with God rather than a mere checklist of actions.
