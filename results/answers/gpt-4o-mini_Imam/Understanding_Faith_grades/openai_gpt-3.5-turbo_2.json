It fails to emphasize the core Christian belief that faith in Jesus involves accepting Him as the Son of God who provides salvation through His sacrifice on the cross. While the explanation of faith in Jesus within an Islamic context is informative, it does not address the concern of understanding the specifically Christian understanding of faith in Jesus."
