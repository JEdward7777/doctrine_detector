  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed explanation of what the term 'faithless' implies within the context of Islam, highlighting the significance of faith in a believer's relationship with Allah. However, the answer could be improved by directly addressing the concern of recognizing the significance of faith in moral conduct. The response focuses more on the theological aspects of faith rather than emphasizing how the term 'faithless' relates to moral behavior. Integrating this aspect would enhance the connection between faith and moral conduct, aligning better with the specified concern provided."
