  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that clearly articulates the biblical definition of a fool in relation to belief and obedience to God. The student provides clear examples from Proverbs and Psalm 14 to support their claims, and they also connect the biblical understanding of foolishness with the importance of faith and obedience in both Christianity and Islam. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical text and its application to personal faith and behavior."
