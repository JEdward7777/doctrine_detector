  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and accurate overview of how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles affected their relationships in the early church. The inclusion of key points such as cultural and religious identity, the role of the apostles, the Jerusalem Council, theological developments, and ongoing tensions demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. The explanation is clear and supported by relevant biblical references. The only improvement could be to further expand on specific biblical passages or examples to strengthen the argument even more. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
