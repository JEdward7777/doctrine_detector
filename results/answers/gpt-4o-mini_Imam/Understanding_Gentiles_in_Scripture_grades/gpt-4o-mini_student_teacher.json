They demonstrated a strong understanding of how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles impacted their relationships, highlighted key events such as the Jerusalem Council and the roles of Peter and Paul, and discussed ongoing tensions within the early Christian community. Additionally, the student integrated Christian teachings and theological developments to support their analysis. The answer aligned closely with the reference answer but provided additional depth and insights, earning a high grade."
