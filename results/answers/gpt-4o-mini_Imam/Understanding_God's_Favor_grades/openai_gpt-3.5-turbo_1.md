# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Christian tradition, particularly as described in the New Testament, Jesus is depicted as demonstrating favor with God and men in several key ways. Here are some examples based on the theological context of the Bible:

1. **Obedience and Faithfulness**: Jesus is portrayed as deeply obedient to God's will. This is evident in his prayers, teachings, and actions. For instance, in the Gospel of Luke (2:49-52), it is mentioned that after losing him for a time, Mary and Joseph found Jesus in the temple, and the passage concludes by stating that Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man.

2. **Compassion and Love**: Jesus showed great compassion towards others, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and caring for the marginalized. His acts of kindness and love toward people from all walks of life helped him gain favor among the masses. 

3. **Teaching and Wisdom**: Jesus' teachings were marked by wisdom and authority, as seen in the Sermon on the Mount and his parables. His ability to connect with people and challenge societal norms won him a significant following.

4. **Miracles**: The miraculous deeds attributed to Jesus, such as healing the sick and raising the dead, served as demonstrations of his divine authority and compassion, further enhancing his favor with people.

5. **Humility and Service**: Jesus exhibited humility, serving others rather than seeking power for himself. His washing of the disciples' feet (John 13) is a prime example of his servant leadership.

From a Muslim perspective, we honor Jesus (known as 'Isa in Islam) as a prophet and messenger of God. We believe he was righteous, delivered Godâ€™s message, and performed miracles by God's permission. Although Muslims do not share the same understanding of his divinity or role in salvation as Christians do, we also recognize the importance of his character and the favor he held in the sight of God as a steadfast servant.
