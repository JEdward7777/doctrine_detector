  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the concept of God calling individuals by name from a comparative religious perspective between Christianity and Islam. However, the answer lacks a strong emphasis on the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals, which was a specific concern raised in the question. Additionally, the student did not directly address the idea of God specifically choosing and appointing individuals for His purpose, as presented in the reference answer. Further elaboration on these points would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview."
