  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical concept of being called by name and its significance in both Christian and Islamic traditions. The inclusion of references to Quranic verses and Islamic perspectives adds depth and demonstrates the student's ability to draw connections between different religious traditions. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific implications of being called by name, particularly in the context of fulfilling God's purpose."
