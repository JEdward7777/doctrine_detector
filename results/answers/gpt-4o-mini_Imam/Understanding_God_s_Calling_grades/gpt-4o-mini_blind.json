  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of being \"called\" by God in a Christian context, highlighting key aspects such as spiritual awakening, vocation, service, community, and discernment. The answer is clear, comprehensive, and respectful of Christian beliefs. One suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the importance of God's sovereignty in the calling process, as it is ultimately God who initiates and directs the calling of individuals."
