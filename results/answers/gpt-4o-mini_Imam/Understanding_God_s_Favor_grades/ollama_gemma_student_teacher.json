They provide relevant examples from the New Testament to support their claims. \n\nThe inclusion of a brief acknowledgment of the Islamic perspective adds an extra dimension to the response, demonstrating awareness of different faith traditions and their perspectives on Jesus. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific qualities or actions that led to Jesus being favored by God and others. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the student's examples to the idea of Jesus growing in favor with both God and men."
