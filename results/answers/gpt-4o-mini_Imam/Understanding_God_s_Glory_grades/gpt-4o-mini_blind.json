  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This answer provides a solid comparison between God's glory as portrayed in the Bible and worldly sources of glory. The student effectively highlights key differences in the source, nature, purpose, eternal significance, and manifestation of God's glory versus worldly glory. The explanation is clear, well-structured, and aligns with a Christian worldview. However, the reference to being Muslim in the concluding paragraph deviates from the Christian-specific focus of the question, which affects the overall cohesion of the response."
