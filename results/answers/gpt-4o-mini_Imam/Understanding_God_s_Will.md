## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
Seeking God's will in our everyday decisions involves striving to align our thoughts, actions, and choices with the teachings of Islam and the guidance provided by the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This process is deeply rooted in the belief that Allah's wisdom is greater than our own and that He knows what is best for us.

Here are some key aspects of what it means to seek God's will:

1. **Prayer and Supplication (Dua)**: Engaging in regular prayer, particularly performing Salah (the five daily prayers), and making heartfelt supplications can help us connect with Allah. Asking Him for guidance in our decisions is a fundamental practice. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) recommended a special prayer called Salat al-Istikhara, a prayer for guidance in making the right choice.

2. **Consulting the Quran and Sunnah**: Before making decisions, Muslims are encouraged to look for guidance in the Quran and the Hadith. These texts provide foundational principles and moral frameworks that can be applied to various situations in life.

3. **Seeking Knowledge and Wisdom**: Educating oneself about Islamic teachings and seeking advice from knowledgeable individuals can help ensure that our decisions are in line with Islamic values. Consulting with family, scholars, or trusted friends can provide additional perspectives.

4. **Self-Reflection**: Taking time to reflect on one’s intentions and the potential impact of a decision can provide clarity. It is important to be honest with oneself about why one is making a particular choice and to evaluate it against Islamic ethics.

5. **Trusting Allah (Tawakkul)**: After making a decision, it’s important to place trust in Allah and accept His plan. This means understanding that while one may strive to make pious and ethical choices, the outcome is ultimately in Allah’s hands.

6. **Aligning with Morality and Ethics**: Seeking God's will also means ensuring that our choices are morally sound and do not harm others. This alignment with ethical behavior is central to being a good Muslim.

7. **Recognizing Signs and Circumstances**: Sometimes, Allah may provide signs or circumstances that indicate a particular path forward. Being attentive to events in our lives can help discern the best course of action.

In essence, seeking God's will is not about controlling every outcome but rather about fostering a mindset and way of living that seeks to fulfill Allah’s purpose for us, creating peace of mind and direction in our daily lives.
