  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "This response provides a thorough explanation of seeking God's will from an Islamic perspective. However, the grading is based on a Christian worldview. \n\nGrade: 70\n\nComment: The response effectively captures the Islamic perspective on seeking God's will in everyday decisions, emphasizing prayer, consulting religious texts, seeking knowledge, reflecting on intentions, trusting in Allah, aligning with morality, and recognizing signs. From a Christian worldview, while some principles may align with seeking God's will (such as prayer, seeking wisdom, aligning with ethical behavior), there are doctrinal differences between Islam and Christianity that affect the understanding and approach to seeking God's will. Additionally, the mention of the specific practices in Islam, like Salah and Salat al-Istikhara, would need to be evaluated differently from a Christian doctrinal standpoint."
