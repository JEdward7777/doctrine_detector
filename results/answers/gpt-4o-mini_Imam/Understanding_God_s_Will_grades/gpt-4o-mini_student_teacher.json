  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and articulate explanation of seeking God's will in everyday decisions from an Islamic perspective, incorporating various key aspects such as prayer, consulting texts, seeking knowledge, self-reflection, trust in Allah, moral alignment, and recognizing signs. However, the answer focused on Islamic beliefs and practices rather than aligning with a Christian worldview. To score higher, the student should have reflected on seeking God's will through understanding His desires and aligning with His revealed will in Scripture from a Christian perspective."
