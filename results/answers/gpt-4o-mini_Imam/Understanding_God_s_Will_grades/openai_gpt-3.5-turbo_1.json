  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of seeking God's will within an Islamic context, emphasizing prayer, consulting scriptures, seeking knowledge, self-reflection, trust in Allah, ethical alignment, and recognition of signs. While the content aligns closely with the given answer and addresses the concern by acknowledging the struggles and uncertainties individuals may face, it is important to note that the response is from an Islamic perspective rather than a Christian perspective. From a Christian worldview, seeking God's will involves aligning with His Word, prayer, seeking the Holy Spirit's guidance, and living according to biblical principles. The response would have received a higher grade if it had addressed seeking God's will specifically within the context of Christianity."
