  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful perspective on seeking God's will within an Islamic context. It addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of prayer, guidance from religious texts, seeking knowledge and wisdom, self-reflection, trusting in Allah, aligning with morality and ethics, and recognizing signs. While the response is rooted in Islamic beliefs and practices, the core principles discussed align with the Christian worldview of seeking God's will through prayer, alignment with Scripture, and moral living. The only point deducted is due to the specific focus on Islamic teachings, which may not fully align with a Christian worldview."
