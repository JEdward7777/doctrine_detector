The student demonstrates a solid understanding of key theological concepts such as the righteousness, purpose, control, restraint, eternity and scope, and love aspects of God's wrath. The answer is doctrinally sound and effectively communicates the differences between God's wrath and human anger, incorporating relevant scriptural references to support the points made. Great job!"
