  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response to the question, demonstrating a clear understanding of the nature of God's wrath as depicted in the Bible. They have effectively highlighted the fundamental differences between God's wrath and human anger, incorporating relevant biblical references and explaining the righteous, redemptive, controlled, eternal, and loving aspects of God's wrath. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a more succinct conclusion that directly ties back to the initial concern regarding God's measured response to sin. Overall, a strong and insightful answer."
