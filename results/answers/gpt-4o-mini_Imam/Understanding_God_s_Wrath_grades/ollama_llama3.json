  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response is strong in its description of God's wrath as a righteous judgment, emphasizing its contrast with human anger. The writer also correctly notes that God's wrath is a measured response to sin, which aligns well with the concern.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more specific biblical examples or passages to support its claims. Additionally, some of the language used, such as \"intense\" and \"upholding justice and holiness,\" could be further developed to demonstrate a deeper understanding of God's wrath.\n\nThe writer's effort to highlight the differences between God's wrath and human anger is commendable, and their summary effectively distills the main points. However, there are moments where the language becomes slightly abstract or too general, which prevents the response from being entirely comprehensive.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of God's wrath and its distinction from human anger, but could benefit from more specific biblical support and further development of key ideas."
