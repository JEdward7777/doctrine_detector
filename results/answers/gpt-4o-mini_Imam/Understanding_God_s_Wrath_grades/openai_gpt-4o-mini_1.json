  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the nature of God's wrath, emphasizing its righteous and redemptive aspects. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting that God's wrath is a measured response, not a fit of rage. The inclusion of scriptural references and the comparison with human anger strengthens the argument. Overall, a well-rounded and well-supported response in line with a Christian worldview."
