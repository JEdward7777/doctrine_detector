## [Answer](../Understanding_Grace.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In a Christian context, the term 'grace' refers to the unmerited favor and love of God toward humanity. It is a central theme in Christian theology and signifies that God's blessings and salvation are given freely, rather than being earned through human efforts or merit. 

There are different types of grace discussed in Christianity:

1. **Common Grace**: This refers to the general blessings that God bestows upon all of humanity, regardless of their faith. It includes things like sunshine, rain, and the moral law that guides human behavior.

2. **Saving Grace**: This is the grace that leads to salvation and is a key belief in many Christian denominations. It asserts that through faith in Jesus Christ, individuals can receive forgiveness for their sins and eternal life.

3. **Sanctifying Grace**: This refers to the grace that helps believers grow in holiness and live according to God's will. It empowers them to live a Christian life and to develop virtues.

4. **Sustaining Grace**: This is the ongoing grace that supports believers in their daily lives and challenges.

Grace is often associated with the teachings of the Apostle Paul, particularly in letters such as Romans and Ephesians, where he elaborates on the concept that through faith in Jesus, believers are justified (made righteous) before God, not by their works, but by grace through faith.

In summary, 'grace' in Christianity is about God's generous and loving action toward humanity, providing salvation and support, which underscores the importance of faith rather than human deeds in the path to spiritual fulfillment.
