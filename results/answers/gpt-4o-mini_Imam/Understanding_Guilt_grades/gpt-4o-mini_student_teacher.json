  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough overview of the concept of guilt as understood in the Bible, explaining key points such as recognition of sin, consequences of sin, repentance, and forgiveness. However, the answer could be improved by centering more on the specific definition provided in the reference answer, which states that being guilty means to have done something morally wrong, specifically to have disobeyed God. While the student touched on this definition, they could have emphasized it more clearly throughout their response."
