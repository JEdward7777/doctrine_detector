  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out and detailed explanation of the differences between 'heaven' and 'sky' from a biblical perspective, touching on their spiritual and physical distinctions. The student also included a comparison with Islamic beliefs for added context. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the biblical definition specifically and providing more direct scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a strong effort with room for a bit more precision and depth in biblical analysis."
