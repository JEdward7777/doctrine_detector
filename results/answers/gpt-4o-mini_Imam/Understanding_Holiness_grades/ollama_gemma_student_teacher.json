  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of God's absolute holiness and its implications for our relationship with Him from a Christian worldview. The response effectively highlights the profound impact of God's holiness on our moral behavior, spiritual growth, and accountability. The inclusion of relevant verses from the Qur'an adds theological depth and supports the arguments presented.\n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from further elaboration on the specific Christian perspective on God's holiness and its connection to the need for redemption through Jesus Christ. Additionally, the student could have explored the concept of God's holiness as revealed in the Bible and its connection to the Christian faith."
