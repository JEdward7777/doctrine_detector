It effectively addressed the concern of our own holiness and the steps needed to approach a holy God by emphasizing the aspects of recognition of God's holiness, moral framework, repentance and forgiveness, call to purity, accountability, and ultimate hope and trust. The only area for improvement would be to make a more explicit connection to the inherent sinfulness of humanity and the need for God's allowance to approach Him in light of His holiness."
