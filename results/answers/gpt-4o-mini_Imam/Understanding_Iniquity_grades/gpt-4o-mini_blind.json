However, the response would benefit from more direct references to biblical verses that define and differentiate these terms. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic teachings in the explanation, while informative in a comparative religious context, may dilute the depth of understanding from a purely Christian worldview. More emphasis on the biblical distinctions and theological significance of these terms would strengthen the response."
