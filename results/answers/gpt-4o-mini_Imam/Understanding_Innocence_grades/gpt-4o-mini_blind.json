  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical concept of innocence in the context of wrongful accusation. They have correctly referenced relevant biblical passages and teachings, such as Deuteronomy 19 and Jesus' teachings on mercy and forgiveness. The response could be improved by delving deeper into the theological significance of innocence and tying it more explicitly to the overarching themes of redemption and atonement in Christian doctrine."
