  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provides a thorough explanation of justice within the context of Islam, the concern specifically asked for a Christian perspective. The student's response does not reference Christian scriptures or teachings on justice, fairness, or righteousness. Therefore, the student's answer does not directly address the concern provided. Moving forward, the student should make sure to tailor their responses to the specific religious context requested in the question."
