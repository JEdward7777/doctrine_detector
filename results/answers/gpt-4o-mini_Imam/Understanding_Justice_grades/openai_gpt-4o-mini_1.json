While the response focuses on Islamic teachings and principles, it effectively addresses the concern of understanding biblical standards of fairness and righteousness by emphasizing key concepts such as equal treatment, enforcement of rights, accountability, integrity, and the balance of justice with mercy and compassion. The integration of these principles demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying values that guide just behavior in both Islamic and Christian worldviews."
