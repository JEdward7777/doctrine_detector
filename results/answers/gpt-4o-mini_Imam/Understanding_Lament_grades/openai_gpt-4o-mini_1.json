While these points are well-developed and insightful from an Islamic worldview, the response lacks a direct address to the concern raised regarding how Christians struggle with expressing sorrows and regrets in a faith context. It would have been beneficial to acknowledge this concern and offer insights specific to Christian beliefs and practices, even in a comparative analysis. Overall, the response is informative and rich in content but could have been enhanced by incorporating a Christian perspective."
