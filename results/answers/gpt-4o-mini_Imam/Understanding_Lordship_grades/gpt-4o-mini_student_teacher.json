However, the response lacks a clear focus on the significance of the term 'Lord' in relation to Jesus and God according to the Bible. The answer could have been improved by incorporating more specific biblical references and focusing on how the term 'Lord' signifies ownership or authority, particularly in relation to Jesus being identified as God."
