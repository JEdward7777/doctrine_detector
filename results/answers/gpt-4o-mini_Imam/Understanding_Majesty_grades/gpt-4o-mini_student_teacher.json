  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term 'majesty' in Islamic theology and its implications for believers, they fail to directly address the concern of understanding God's attributes and His sovereignty over creation from a Christian perspective. The answer focuses more on the Islamic understanding of 'majesty' rather than addressing the specific concern provided in the prompt.\n\nTo improve the grade, the student should incorporate more insights on how the concept of 'majesty' in God's character relates to the Christian worldview, emphasizing God's sovereignty, attributes such as omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence, and His role as the Creator and Ruler of the universe."
