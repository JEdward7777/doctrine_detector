  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-rounded and thoughtful response on demonstrating mercy in daily life, drawing upon Islamic teachings and examples. However, since the grading is based on a Christian worldview, it is important to note that the response references teachings and figures from Islam. While the principles of mercy and compassion are universal, a Christian-specific response would have focused on the mercy of God as revealed through Jesus Christ and the teachings of the Bible. Additionally, some Christian-specific examples and references could have enhanced the answer further."
