  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response on demonstrating mercy in daily life, drawing from Islamic teachings and practices. While the answer aligned well with the concern of embodying God's merciful nature in interactions with others, it included specific examples and practical steps to follow. However, the response did not directly reference the Christian perspective on mercy and God's nature, which is the framework for grading in this context. Encouraging the student to incorporate Christian teachings and beliefs on mercy and God's nature would strengthen the response further."
