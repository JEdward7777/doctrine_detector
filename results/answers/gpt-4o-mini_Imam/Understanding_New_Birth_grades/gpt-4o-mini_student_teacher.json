  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the concept of being \"born again\" according to the Bible, referencing the scriptural basis and implications it holds for Christian belief. However, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives, while informative, deviates from the Christian-specific worldview required for grading this response. To improve the grade, the student should focus solely on the Christian understanding of being \"born again.\""
