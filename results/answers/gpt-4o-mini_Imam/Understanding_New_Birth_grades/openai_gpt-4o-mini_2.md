## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The concept of being "born again" is primarily found in the New Testament of the Bible, particularly in the Gospel of John. In John 3:3-7, Jesus tells Nicodemus that "no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again." This phrase, in this context, means to experience a spiritual rebirth or regeneration. It signifies a transformation in which a person, through faith in Jesus Christ, receives a new spiritual life.

This idea emphasizes the need for believers to undergo a significant change in their hearts and minds, often associated with repentance and faith. In Christian theology, being born again is linked to the forgiveness of sins and the reception of the Holy Spirit, marking a new beginning in one's relationship with God.

From an Islamic perspective, we recognize that concepts of spiritual renewal and transformation also exist, although the terminology and understanding may differ. In Islam, the process of becoming a better person and spiritually awakening often involves repentance (tawbah), sincere faith (iman), and submission to Allahâ€™s will. While the terms "born again" and its implications are specific to Christian beliefs, the underlying principle of striving for a renewed connection with God is a shared theme across many faiths, including Islam.
