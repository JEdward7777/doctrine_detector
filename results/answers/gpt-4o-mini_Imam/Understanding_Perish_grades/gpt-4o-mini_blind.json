It correctly emphasizes the idea of spiritual death and separation from God as the ultimate consequence of sin and rejection of God's guidance. The references to John 3:16 and Matthew 10:28 support the explanation effectively. A minor improvement could be further elaborating on the implications of eternal separation from God in terms of the consequences and the nature of that separation."
