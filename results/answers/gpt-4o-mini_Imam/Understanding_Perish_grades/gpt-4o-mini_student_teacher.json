  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the concept of 'perishing' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. They effectively explored the implications of spiritual separation from God, referring to relevant Bible verses and emphasizing the idea of eternal separation from God due to sin and rejection of His salvation through Jesus Christ. The student's answer aligns well with the reference answer from the teacher, showing a good understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic. Great job!"
