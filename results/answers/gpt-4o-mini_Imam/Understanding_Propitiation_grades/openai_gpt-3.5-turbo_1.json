It accurately addresses the concern by highlighting the Christian view that Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath, leading to forgiveness and eternal life for sinners. However, the response could have further elaborated on how propitiation reflects both God's justice and mercy within the Christian worldview. A more in-depth exploration of the interconnectedness of these attributes would have strengthened the overall analysis."
