The explanation of how propitiation in Christianity satisfies God's justice and wrath is well-articulated. However, the response could have delved deeper into how propitiation also relates to God's mercy, connecting the act of sacrifice to God's loving nature and His desire for reconciliation with humanity. A more robust exploration of this aspect would have strengthened the argument within a Christian worldview."
