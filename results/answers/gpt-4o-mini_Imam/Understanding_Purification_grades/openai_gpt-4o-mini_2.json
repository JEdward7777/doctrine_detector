It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how the process of ritual purification reflects God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin. The integration of a Christian worldview could strengthen the discussion by emphasizing the ultimate need for Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for sin and the fulfillment of the purification rituals in the New Testament."
