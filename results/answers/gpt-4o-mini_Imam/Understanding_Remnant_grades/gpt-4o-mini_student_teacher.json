  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer on how the concept of the remnant can inspire believers to remain faithful in times of persecution, drawing parallels between biblical and Islamic principles. However, the answer could better address the concern of understanding the source of strength during difficult times by focusing more on how God's grace is extended to those who remain faithful. There was a good exploration of community support and spiritual growth, but a stronger emphasis on God's intervention and provision of strength could have aligned the answer more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
