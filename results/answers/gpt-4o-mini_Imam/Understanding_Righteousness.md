## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, the concept of God being described as 'righteous' (al-â€˜Adl or al-Haqq) encompasses several important attributes. To say that God is righteous means that He is just, fair, and embodies the highest moral standards. This characteristic underscores several key aspects:

1. **Divine Justice**: Allah is entirely just and does not commit any acts of injustice. His actions are perfectly aligned with fairness, and He rewards or punishes individuals based on their deeds, as highlighted in the Qur'an where it states, "Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while they will be questioned" (Qur'an 4:40).

2. **Moral Perfection**: Righteousness in God implies that His nature is free from any shortcomings, flaws, or immoral traits. He is the epitome of truth and virtue, and everything He commands is rooted in wisdom and goodness.

3. **Guidance and Legislation**: Allah, in His righteousness, provides guidance to humanity through revelations, teachings, and prophetic messages. The rules and principles outlined in the Qur'an and Sunnah reflect His divine wisdom aimed at promoting justice and righteousness in society.

4. **Infallibility**: God's decisions are free from error or bias. He possesses complete knowledge and understanding of all circumstances, ensuring that His judgments are always right and equitable.

5. **Accountability**: The fact that God is righteous is closely related to the concept of accountability in Islam. On the Day of Judgment, every individual will be held accountable for their actions, reflecting God's righteous nature in dealing with humanity fairly.

In summary, describing God as righteous conveys His supreme justice, moral perfection, and commitment to guiding humanity towards a path of righteousness and fairness. This forms a core component of a Muslim's understanding of their Creator and impacts their relationship with Him and with others.
