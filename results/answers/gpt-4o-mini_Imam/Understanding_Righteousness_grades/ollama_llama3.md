## [Answer](../Understanding_Righteousness.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, the concept of God being described as 'righteous' (al-â€˜Adl or al-Haqq) encompasses several important attributes. To say that God is righteous means that He is just, fair, and embodies the highest moral standards. This characteristic underscores several key aspects:

1. **Divine Justice**: Allah is entirely just and does not commit any acts of injustice. His actions are perfectly aligned with fairness, and He rewards or punishes individuals based on their deeds, as highlighted in the Qur'an where it states, "Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom's weight; while they will be questioned" (Qur'an 4:40).

2. **Moral Perfection**: Righteousness in God implies that His nature is free from any shortcomings, flaws, or immoral traits. He is the epitome of truth and virtue, and everything He commands is rooted in wisdom and goodness.

3. **Guidance and Legislation**: Allah, in His righteousness, provides guidance to humanity through revelations, teachings, and prophetic messages. The rules and principles outlined in the Qur'an and Sunnah reflect His divine wisdom aimed at promoting justice and righteousness in society.

4. **Infallibility**: God's decisions are free from error or bias. He possesses complete knowledge and understanding of all circumstances, ensuring that His judgments are always right and equitable.

5. **Accountability**: The fact that God is righteous is closely related to the concept of accountability in Islam. On the Day of Judgment, every individual will be held accountable for their actions, reflecting God's righteous nature in dealing with humanity fairly.

In summary, describing God as righteous conveys His supreme justice, moral perfection, and commitment to guiding humanity towards a path of righteousness and fairness. This forms a core component of a Muslim's understanding of their Creator and impacts their relationship with Him and with others.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of Islamic theology's concept of God being described as "righteous," which aligns with the specified concern about understanding the nature of God's righteousness. The LLM response effectively breaks down the attributes of God's righteousness, including Divine Justice, Moral Perfection, Guidance and Legislation, Infallibility, and Accountability. While it does not directly address the answer provided ("God's righteousness refers to His absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love, which necessitates the condemnation of sin"), it provides a more detailed explanation of God's righteous nature within an Islamic context.

The response meets the concern by highlighting the significance of understanding God's righteousness in appreciating His justice and love. However, it does not explicitly connect the dots between God's righteousness and its consequences, such as sin and condemnation. A higher score would require the LLM to more directly address the specified answer and demonstrate a clearer connection between God's righteousness and His judgment on sin.
