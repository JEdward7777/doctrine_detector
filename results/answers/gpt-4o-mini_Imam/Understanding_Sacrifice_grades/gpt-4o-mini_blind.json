However, the answer lacked depth in exploring the theological significance of Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb in Christianity. Additionally, it did not emphasize Jesus' sacrificial death and atoning work on the cross as central to the Christian understanding of salvation, which is essential to grasp the symbolism of Jesus as the 'Lamb of God'. The explanation could have been more doctrinally sound and focused on the unique Christian view of Jesus' sacrificial role in atonement."
