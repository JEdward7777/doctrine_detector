In Islamic tradition, we recognize Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) as a significant prophet, but we have differing views on some theological concepts that are embraced in Christianity. The title 'Lamb of God' primarily arises from Christian beliefs, particularly in the context of Jesus' role in salvation.

In the Christian framework, the ‘Lamb of God’ refers to Jesus as a sacrificial figure, akin to the lambs that were sacrificed in the Old Testament, particularly during Passover and other religious observances. The lamb symbolizes innocence and purity, and the sacrificial system established in the Hebrew Bible involved the offering of blemish-free lambs to God as a means of atonement for sin (Exodus 12:1-14; Leviticus 4).

This idea is deeply rooted in the narrative of the Passover, where the Israelites are instructed to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood, signifying protection from the plagues and divine judgment. In Christian theology, Jesus is viewed as the ultimate fulfillment of this sacrificial system, through which he takes on the sins of humanity, thus offering salvation.

In contrast, Islam does not subscribe to the notion of Jesus as divine or as a sacrificial savior. In fact, the Quran teaches that Jesus was a messenger of Allah and that he performed miracles by God's permission, but he is not seen as a sacrifice for sin (Quran 4:171). Instead, Muslims believe that each individual is responsible for their own relationship with God and for seeking forgiveness through sincere repentance and good deeds.

In summary, while 'Lamb of God' in Christian thought draws from the sacrificial practices of the Old Testament and symbolizes atonement through Jesus, in Islamic theology, Jesus holds a respected role as a prophet, without the sacrificial implications assigned to him in Christianity.
