It effectively contrasts this belief with Islamic perspectives on Jesus as a prophet. The connection between Jesus' sacrificial role and God's plan for redemption is explored well. The only improvement would be to further emphasize the unique Christian understanding of Jesus' sacrificial atonement as central to redemption in God's plan."
