## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The Hebrew term "Shaddai" is often translated as "Almighty" and is commonly used in the context of referring to God in the Old Testament (Tanakh). In this usage, it signifies God's ultimate power and strength. The term appears in various verses, such as in the name "El Shaddai," which emphasizes God's sovereignty and capability to provide and protect.

In the context of the Old Testament, "Shaddai" conveys a sense of God's provision, nurturing, and sufficiency, highlighting His role as a caretaker of creation. It reflects His ability to fulfill promises and to support His people through various challenges. For instance, God uses this name in the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 17:1, where He declares, "I am El Shaddai; walk before Me and be blameless."

The term has deep theological implications and reinforces the themes of trust and reliance on God's power and sustenance throughout the Scriptures. While the focus of the term is primarily in the Jewish tradition, it is also acknowledged and respected in Islamic theology when addressing the oneness and supremacy of God, as Muslims believe in the same God worshipped in Judeo-Christian traditions. In Islam, God's names (Asma'ul Husna) include attributes that reflect His might and mercy, similar to the implications of "Shaddai."
