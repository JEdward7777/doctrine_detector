  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the term \"Shaddai\" in the Old Testament, discussing its significance in conveying God's provision, nurturing, and sufficiency. The response also acknowledges the theological implications and the themes of trust and reliance on God's power. However, there is a discrepancy between the student's answer and the teacher's reference in terms of the specific meaning of \"Shaddai.\" The student may benefit from aligning their explanation more closely with the origin and possible meanings of the term as provided in the reference answer."
