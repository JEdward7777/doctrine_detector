It explores the theological implications and connections with trust and reliance on God, as well as acknowledges the term's significance in both Jewish and Islamic traditions. However, it could further connect these attributes of God to His revelation in Scripture, particularly in terms of His sovereignty, faithfulness, and ability to fulfill His promises throughout the Bible."
