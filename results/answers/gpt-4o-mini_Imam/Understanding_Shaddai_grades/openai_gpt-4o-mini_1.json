The incorporation of the covenant with Abraham and the theological implications of \"Shaddai\" effectively address the concern of understanding God's nature and attributes as revealed in Scripture. However, the response could have included more explicit references to specific Scriptures and theological doctrines related to the term \"Shaddai\" to further enhance its depth and accuracy."
