  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and detailed account of Jesus' strategies for resisting temptation, drawing from biblical accounts in Matthew and Luke. It effectively illustrates how Jesus used Scripture, prayer and fasting, spiritual strength, rejection of worldly power, awareness of deception, and firm resolve to overcome temptations. While the response does not directly address the concern about combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ, it provides valuable principles and examples that can be applied in this context.\n\nThe response receives high marks for its biblical grounding, clarity, and coherence. However, it could benefit from more explicit connections between Jesus' strategies and practical applications for everyday life. To receive a higher grade, the response might consider providing concrete suggestions or anecdotes about how to incorporate these principles into one's daily walk with Christ."
