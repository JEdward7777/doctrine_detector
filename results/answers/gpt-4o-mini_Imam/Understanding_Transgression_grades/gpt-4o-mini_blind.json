The student accurately describes the concept as violating God's commandments and moral principles, providing examples from both the Old and New Testaments. The mention of the Hebrew term \"pesha\" adds depth to the answer. The emphasis on the seriousness of transgression and the call to repentance and righteousness aligns with Christian doctrine. Overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
