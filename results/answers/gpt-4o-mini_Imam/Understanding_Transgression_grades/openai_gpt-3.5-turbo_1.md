# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In a Biblical context, the term "transgress" generally implies the act of violating a commandment, law, or moral principle. It is associated with the idea of stepping beyond the boundaries set by God's laws and engaging in behavior that is considered sinful or disobedient.

In the Old Testament, for example, "transgression" can refer to breaking specific commandments given in the Torah or the broader moral laws that govern ethical behavior. The Hebrew term for transgression, "pesha," indicates rebellion or a willful violation of God's directives. 

In the New Testament, transgression is often linked to sin and disobedience to the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. It serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to divine instructions and the consequences of straying from them.

Overall, in both contexts, transgression carries a serious connotation, highlighting the need for repentance and the pursuit of righteousness in the eyes of God.
