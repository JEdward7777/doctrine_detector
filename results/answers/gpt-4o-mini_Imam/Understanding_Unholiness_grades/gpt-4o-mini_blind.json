  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: The student has provided a detailed and well-thought-out response discussing the characteristics of an 'unholy' life in Islam and ways to identify them in actions or society. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of faith, morality, and righteousness in the context of Islam. However, the student should have clearly stated at the beginning that the response is from an Islamic perspective rather than a Christian one. Additionally, the response lacks a clear connection to Christian doctrine and teachings, which is essential for grading from a Christian worldview. Furthermore, the language and terminology used should align more closely with Christian beliefs for a higher grade in a Christian specific worldview context."
