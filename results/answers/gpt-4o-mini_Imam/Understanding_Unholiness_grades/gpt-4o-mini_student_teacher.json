  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and thoughtfully constructed response considering the Islamic perspective on living a holy life. However, the answer focuses on Islamic beliefs and practices rather than exploring the broader concept of an 'unholy' life from a Christian worldview. While the response offers valuable insights into recognizing characteristics of unholiness and ways to address them, a stronger emphasis on how these align (or don't align) with Christian beliefs would have improved the grade. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into discussing how rebellion against God, dishonoring actions, and practices contrary to God's glory can manifest in an individual or society within a Christian context would enhance the overall response."
