The answer is well-supported with references to relevant Scriptures, such as 1 John 2:15-17. The connection between being \"worldly\" and its negative impact on spiritual growth is clearly articulated. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian teachings on worldly attitudes and values. Great job!"
