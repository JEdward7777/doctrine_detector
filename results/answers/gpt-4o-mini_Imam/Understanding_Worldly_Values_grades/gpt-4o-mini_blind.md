## [Answer](../Understanding_Worldly_Values.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The term "worldly" in a Christian context often refers to attitudes, behaviors, and values that are associated with secular, materialistic, or earthly concerns, as opposed to spiritual or divine matters. It implies a focus on temporal gains and pleasures rather than on eternal truths or moral and spiritual principles. 

In Christian teachings, being "worldly" can suggest an inclination towards sinfulness, self-indulgence, and a lack of concern for spiritual growth or community welfare. Scriptures often warn against being too attached to worldly things, as they can distract individuals from their relationship with God. For instance, in 1 John 2:15-17, believers are cautioned not to love the world or anything in it, indicating that worldly desires can lead one away from the love of the Father.

Thus, in Christianity, the label "worldly" typically carries a negative connotation, indicating behaviors that prioritize earthly satisfaction and materialism over spiritual development and alignment with God's will. In essence, it serves as a reminder for believers to maintain their focus on their faith and the teachings of Jesus, rather than getting lost in the distractions of the worldly life.
