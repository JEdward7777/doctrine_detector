  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thorough explanation of the term \"worldly\" in a Christian context, highlighting the focus on materialism, sinfulness, and distractions from spiritual growth. However, the student's answer could have been improved by emphasizing more the inherently evil and ungodly nature of worldly behaviors, as indicated in the reference answer. A stronger connection could have been made between the contrast of worldly values and godly principles."
