It effectively expands on the concept by highlighting how being \"worldly\" can lead individuals away from spiritual growth and alignment with God's will. The inclusion of relevant scriptures enhances the response's depth and biblical foundation. The discussion reflects a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on the topic."
