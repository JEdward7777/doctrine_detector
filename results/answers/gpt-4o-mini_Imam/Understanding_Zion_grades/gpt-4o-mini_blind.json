However, the inclusion of information about Islam and interfaith dialogue is not directly relevant to the question posed, which could distract from a focused and in-depth exploration of the term's meaning within a Christian worldview. Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific references to biblical passages or historical context to support the explanation provided."
