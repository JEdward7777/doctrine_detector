However, the student missed the Christian-specific worldview in their response. The focus on interfaith dialogue with Islam, while valuable, detracts from a Christian perspective on the metaphorical language in Scripture and God's relationship with His people. The answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the concept of God's covenant relationship with Israel and His redemptive plan through the fulfillment of prophecies in Christ."
