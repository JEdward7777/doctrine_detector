However, the response could have delved deeper into the specific biblical context of the term, emphasizing the significance of Jerusalem and the prophetic implications tied to the metaphorical language used in Scripture. Additionally, while the response briefly mentions the potential for interfaith dialogue with Muslims, it could have explored this aspect further from a Christian worldview perspective."
