  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the differences between Sheol and Hades in the context of the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. The student effectively distinguishes between the two terms and their nuances in both the Old and New Testaments. The answer could be enhanced by incorporating more scriptural references to support the points made and by emphasizing the significance of Jesus' victory over death in relation to these concepts. Overall, a solid explanation with room for minor improvements."
