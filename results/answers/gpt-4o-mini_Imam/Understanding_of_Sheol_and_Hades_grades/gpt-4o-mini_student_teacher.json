  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed explanation of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the Bible, highlighting their differences and evolution in understanding. The student accurately points out the general understanding of Sheol as a neutral realm of the dead in the Old Testament and the more nuanced depiction of Hades in the New Testament, especially concerning the righteous and the unrighteous. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death. The only minor suggestion would be to further emphasize the shift in the understanding of Sheol and Hades over time, similar to the reference answer."
