  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the evolution of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in biblical context, particularly focusing on the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death. The response effectively discusses how Sheol and Hades were understood differently over time and how the New Testament brings a clearer differentiation between the destinies of the righteous and the unrighteous. The student effectively addresses the concern raised and demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological developments in the Bible regarding the afterlife."
