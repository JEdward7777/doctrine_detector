## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islam, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is revered as one of the great prophets and messengers of Allah, but the theological understanding of his role differs significantly from that in Christianity. The term "cornerstone" primarily carries Christian connotations, especially in the context of the New Testament, where Jesus is portrayed as foundational to the faith of Christians.

In the Assemblies of believers in Christianity, Jesus is considered the cornerstone because He is seen as the foundational figure upon whom the Church is built. This reflects the belief that Jesus' life, death, and resurrection are central to salvation and the Christian faith.

From an Islamic perspective, while we honor Jesus as a prophet and a significant figure, Muslims do not view him as divine or as the cornerstone of the faith in the same sense. Instead, the cornerstone of the Muslim faith is the belief in the oneness of Allah (Tawheed) and the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the final prophet. The community of believers (Ummah) is united under the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad.

It is important to appreciate that, according to Islamic belief, Jesus will return in the End Times, where he will uphold the truth of Islam and correct misunderstandings about his role and divinity. Thus, while Jesus holds a respected position in Islam, his function and significance differ from that attributed to him within Christian theology. 

In summary, in the context of the Assembly of believers, we view Jesus as a revered prophet, with an essential role in God's plan, while our foundational beliefs rest primarily on the message of the Prophet Muhammad and the teachings of the Quran.
