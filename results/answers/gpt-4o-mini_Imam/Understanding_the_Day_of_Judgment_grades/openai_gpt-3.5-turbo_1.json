The discussion effectively relates Jesus' role as a judge to honor, fulfillment of prophecies, accountability, recognition of Tawhid, and the embodiment of justice and mercy. While the response does not directly align with the specified Christian worldview, it offers valuable insights from an Islamic perspective on this theological concept."
