The response effectively ties in the importance of faith in Jesus as judge and the implications of His role for believers, aligning with the Christian concern provided. The only minor deduction is for the different theological perspectives between Islam and Christianity, which might lead to some differing interpretations of Jesus' role as judge between the two faiths."
