## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Day_of_Judgment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islam, Jesus (known as 'Isa in Arabic) is regarded as one of the great prophets and messengers of Allah. The significance of Jesus being appointed as a judge on the Day of Judgment can be understood through several key points:

1. **Honor and Status**: Jesus holds a revered position in Islam as one of the five most important prophets (Ulul Azm). His role as a judge connotes respect and honor bestowed upon him by Allah. It highlights the elevated status of Jesus within the Islamic tradition.

2. **Fulfillment of Prophecies**: The role of Jesus in the hereafter is seen as a fulfillment of prophecies and a continuation of his mission on Earth. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus will return before the Day of Judgment to restore justice, defeat falsehood, and establish truth.

3. **Witness against Humanity**: On the Day of Judgment, prophets are considered witnesses against their communities. Jesus' role as a judge underscores his responsibility to testify regarding the deeds of his followers and to guide them, reflecting the broader principle of accountability.

4. **Recognition of Tawhid**: The acknowledgment of Jesus as a judge emphasizes the Islamic concept of Tawhid, the oneness of Allah. Jesus is not seen as divine himself but as a servant and messenger of Allah, thus reinforcing the central belief in the oneness of God in Islam.

5. **Symbol of Justice and Mercy**: Jesus' return is associated with the establishment of justice and mercy, embodying the qualities that are highly regarded in Islam. He is believed to advocate for fairness and compassion during his judgment, fulfilling the promise that Allah is, ultimately, Just and Merciful.

In summary, Jesus Christâ€™s appointment as a judge on the Day of Judgment signifies his esteemed role in Islam, his embodiment of justice, his fulfillment of prophecies, and reinforces the foundational Islamic beliefs about prophecy and accountability.
