It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the idea of being chosen by God for holiness and spiritual fruitfulness. The inclusion of both Old Testament and New Testament perspectives enhances the depth of the discussion. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connections to the significance of being chosen by God in one's faith journey, perhaps by delving deeper into the transformative impact of this divine election on individual believers."
