  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of the term \"house of God\" in a biblical context, covering its significance in both the Old and New Testaments. The explanation is thorough, accurate, and demonstrates a clear knowledge of Christian teachings regarding sacred spaces and worship. One area for improvement could be to emphasize the holiness and reverence associated with the \"house of God\" even more explicitly, to underscore the divine presence and sanctity within such places."
