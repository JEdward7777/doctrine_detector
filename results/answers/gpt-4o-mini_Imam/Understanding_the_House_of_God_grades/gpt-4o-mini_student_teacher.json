  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that accurately discusses the meaning and significance of the term \"house of God\" in both the Old and New Testaments. They correctly highlighted the association of the term with places of worship and divine presence, specifically referencing the Temple in Jerusalem and the broader concept of the church as the house of God. The additional information on the Tabernacle in the Old Testament and the community of believers in the New Testament adds depth to their response. However, the answer could have been more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which focused solely on the worship aspect related to the tabernacle or temple."
