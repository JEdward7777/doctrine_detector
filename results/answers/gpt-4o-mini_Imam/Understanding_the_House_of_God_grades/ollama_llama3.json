  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does mention that the \"house of God\" refers to a place where God is worshiped, which is correct in terms of its association with the Tabernacle and Temple. However, it only scratches the surface in terms of clarifying the significance and meaning of the term. The response lacks depth and breadth in exploring the biblical context and the different ways the phrase is used throughout Scripture.\n\nThe comment on this grade is: This response demonstrates some understanding of the term \"house of God\", but it fails to provide a more comprehensive overview of its significance and meaning in Scripture. It would be helpful to include more specific examples from both the Old and New Testaments to further clarify the concept."
