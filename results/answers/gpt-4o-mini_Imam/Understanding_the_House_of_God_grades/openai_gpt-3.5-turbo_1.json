It accurately discusses the various contexts in which the term is used and shows a good understanding of how the concept of the \"house of God\" extends beyond physical structures to encompass the community of believers. The integration of biblical references and theological insights enhances the clarity and depth of the response, aligning with a Christian worldview."
