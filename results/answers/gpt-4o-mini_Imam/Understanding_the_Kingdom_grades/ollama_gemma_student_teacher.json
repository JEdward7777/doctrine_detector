They clearly articulate its spiritual and physical dimensions, emphasizing divine sovereignty and the transformation of individuals. Additionally, the inclusion of ethical implications and cross-cultural relevance adds depth to the response. However, the answer would benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern regarding God's sovereignty and authority in our lives."
