However, from a Christian worldview, there are significant doctrinal differences, especially concerning Jesus' first coming, crucifixion, and role in the eschatological events. The answer does not address the Christian understanding of the \"last days\" and Jesus' first and second comings, which would be essential for a comprehensive response."
