  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer focuses on Islamic eschatology rather than the Christian perspective, which is the context of the question. The answer does not address the timeline of major Biblical events concerning Jesus' first and second comings from a Christian worldview, which is the main concern in this context. The response lacks adherence to the specific concern provided, resulting in a low grade."
