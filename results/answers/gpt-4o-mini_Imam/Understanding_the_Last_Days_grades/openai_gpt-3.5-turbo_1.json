However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to clarify the distinction between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' first and second comings. The response should have addressed the unique Christian understanding of Jesus' first coming as the incarnation of God in human form, His sacrificial death on the cross for the redemption of humanity, and His eventual return in glory to establish His kingdom. Emphasizing the theological differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on Jesus' role in eschatology would have provided a more comprehensive evaluation."
