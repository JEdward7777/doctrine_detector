# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic eschatology, the concept of the "last days" encompasses the events and signs that are believed to precede the Day of Judgment, including the role of Jesus (Isa, peace be upon him). 

1. **First Coming of Jesus**: In Islamic belief, Jesus was born miraculously and delivered the message of monotheism. His first coming was primarily as a prophet to the Children of Israel. According to Islamic tradition, he performed miracles and preached the message of God, but he was not crucified; rather, it is believed that Allah raised him up to Himself.

2. **Second Coming of Jesus**: Muslims believe that before the Day of Judgment, Jesus will return to earth. This second coming is seen as a significant event during the "last days." His return is viewed as a reassurance of God's support for the believers and will coincide with signs leading up to the Hour (the Day of Judgment). In this context, Jesus is expected to restore justice, defeat the false messiah (Dajjal), and lead people back to the true path of Islam. 

3. **Signs of the Last Days**: The last days, or the latter times, are associated with a series of signs and events, such as the emergence of fitnah (trials and tribulations), the spread of immorality, and signs in nature. The return of Jesus, alongside the appearance of various other prophetic figures, is seen as part of God's plan to restore balance and guide humanity.

Overall, the "last days" signify a period of immense trials but also hope for believers, culminating in the Day of Judgment where all will be held accountable for their deeds. Jesus’ role in these final events emphasizes his importance within Islamic theology and the unity of God's message across different prophets.

Comment: The response accurately explains the Islamic perspective on the concept of the "last days" and the role of Jesus in Islamic eschatology. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to clarify the distinction between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' first and second comings. The response should have addressed the unique Christian understanding of Jesus' first coming as the incarnation of God in human form, His sacrificial death on the cross for the redemption of humanity, and His eventual return in glory to establish His kingdom. Emphasizing the theological differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on Jesus' role in eschatology would have provided a more comprehensive evaluation.
