The inclusion of specific examples and references to the Old Testament adds depth to the explanation. However, while the response effectively outlines the ancient laws and their intended purposes for the Israelites, there could be more elaboration on how these laws are still relevant today for Christians, considering the concern specified. A deeper exploration of the enduring principles and values that can be derived from the Law of Moses would have strengthened the response."
