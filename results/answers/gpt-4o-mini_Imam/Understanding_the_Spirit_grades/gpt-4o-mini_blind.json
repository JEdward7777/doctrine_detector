  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation differentiating between the human spirit and evil spirits in the Bible. They have correctly highlighted the divine origin and purpose of the human spirit as well as the malevolent nature of evil spirits. The references to specific biblical passages to support their points are commendable. However, to enhance the answer further, the student could have delved deeper into the scriptural basis for the characteristics and actions of evil spirits, and also elaborated more on the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding and filling the human spirit."
