  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90. \n\nThe student's response provides a clear and well-structured explanation of the differentiation between the human spirit and evil spirits in the Bible. They accurately highlight the origins, characteristics, and purposes of each, drawing from relevant biblical passages to support their points. The student also effectively addresses the concern of distinguishing personal spiritual identity from malevolent spiritual influences. However, the teacher's reference answer provides a more concise and straightforward explanation, which is why I deducted a few points. Overall, the student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and effectively applied a Christian worldview in their response."
