  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The answer presents a fundamental misunderstanding by referring to God as Allah instead of the biblical God of Israel. Additionally, the lack of referencing the specific biblical context and terminology such as Yahweh or the LORD, the Holy of Holies, and the sacrificial system used by the Israelites significantly detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the response. The emphasis on a covenantal relationship and community cohesion is appropriate, but the student's response needs significant improvement to align with a Christian-specific worldview."
