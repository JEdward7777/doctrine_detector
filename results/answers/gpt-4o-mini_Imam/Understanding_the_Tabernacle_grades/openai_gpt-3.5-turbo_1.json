However, the inclusion of references to Allah and the perspective of the Israelites' relationship with Allah rather than God may be a concern from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the response lacks depth in explaining the significance of the Tabernacle in strengthening the Israelites' covenantal relationship with God and community cohesion, which are important aspects to consider for a holistic understanding of its role."
