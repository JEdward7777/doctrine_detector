The explanation of the Christian perspective, particularly the connection to Daniel's prophetic vision and the role of Jesus as both human and divine, is well articulated. However, the discussion on Islam could be further elaborated upon to include distinctions on Jesus's nature and role in Islamic theology in relation to the title \"Son of Man.\" Additionally, highlighting the doctrinal differences between Christianity and Islam regarding Jesus's identity more explicitly would strengthen the overall response."
