  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and informative answer that demonstrates an understanding of the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in both Christian and Islamic traditions. They accurately explained the Christian perspective on the title and its connection to Jesus' humanity and divinity, as well as acknowledged the differences in interpretation between Christianity and Islam. However, the student could have further emphasized the central Christian belief that Jesus is the Son of God and the unique Savior of humanity, distinct from any other prophets."
