The inclusion of references to the Gospels and the Book of Daniel enriches the discussion. Additionally, the comparison with the Islamic understanding of Jesus and the title \"Son of Man\" adds depth to the analysis. However, more explicit connections to the implications for our faith could further strengthen the response. Overall, a well-articulated and informative explanation."
