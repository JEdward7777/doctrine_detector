  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' from a Christian perspective, emphasizing His dual nature as fully human and fully divine. It correctly connects this title to His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity. The response also effectively contrasts the Christian interpretation with the Islamic perspective, highlighting the differing understandings of the title 'Son of Man.' Overall, the explanation is clear, well-supported, and addresses the concern raised."
