  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in both Christian and Islamic traditions, considering the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine. It addresses the concern about understanding the implications of Jesus' self-identification effectively. However, it could have included more explicit references to biblical passages where Jesus refers to Himself as the \"Son of Man\" to further support the explanation."
