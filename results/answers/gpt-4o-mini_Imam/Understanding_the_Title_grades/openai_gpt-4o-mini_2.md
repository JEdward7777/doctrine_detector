## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Title.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the context of Jesus' identity, the title "Son of Man" has profound significance, particularly within the Christian and Islamic traditions, though its interpretation can vary.

From a Christian perspective, "Son of Man" is often understood as a title that emphasizes both the humanity and divinity of Jesus. It appears frequently in the Gospels, being used by Jesus Himself to describe His earthly ministry, suffering, and authority. This term connects to the prophetic visions found in the Hebrew Scriptures, particularly in the Book of Daniel (Daniel 7:13-14), where the "Son of Man" is depicted as a figure with divine authority who will establish God's kingdom.

In Islam, Jesus (known as 'Isa) is revered as a prophet and messenger of Allah. However, the concept of "Son of Man" is not applied to Him in the same way as in Christian theology. In Islam, attributing a sonship to God or any human being is inconsistent with the Islamic understanding of Tawhid (the oneness of God). Instead, Jesus is viewed as a humble servant of Allah, born of the Virgin Mary (Maryam), performing miracles and delivering God's message, but without any divine sonship.

Thus, while the title "Son of Man" carries significant theological weight and implications in Christian thought about Jesus' identity and mission, it is interpreted and approached differently in the Islamic tradition, emphasizing His role as a prophet rather than a divine figure.

Grade: 85

Comment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the title "Son of Man" in both Christian and Islamic traditions, considering the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine. It addresses the concern about understanding the implications of Jesus' self-identification effectively. However, it could have included more explicit references to biblical passages where Jesus refers to Himself as the "Son of Man" to further support the explanation.
