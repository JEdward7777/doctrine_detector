The explanation of Islam's understanding of Allah's attributes and the rejection of the Trinity was clear. However, the answer could have been strengthened by providing more Biblical references or explanations from a Christian perspective on the concept of the Trinity. Additionally, there was room for improvement in addressing how Christians reconcile the triune nature of God within the unity of His essence."
