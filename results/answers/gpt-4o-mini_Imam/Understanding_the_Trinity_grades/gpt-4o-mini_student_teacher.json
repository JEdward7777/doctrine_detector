  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of Islamic theology regarding monotheism and the concept of Tawhid. However, the student does not directly address the complexity of the Trinity within Christianity and how God can exist as three persons yet one God. The answer should have focused more on the specific Christian perspective on the Trinity rather than contrasting it with Islamic beliefs."
