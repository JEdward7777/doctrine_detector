The connection is effectively made between the concerns of unfaithfulness in worship and its implications on the believer's relationship with God. The incorporation of Quranic and Hadith references enriches the discussion and strengthens the Christian perspective on the importance of faithfulness in worship and obedience to God's commands. Great job overall."
