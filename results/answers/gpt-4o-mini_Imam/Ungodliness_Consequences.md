In Islamic teachings, the consequences for ungodly people, or those who reject faith and live in disobedience to God's commandments, are addressed in various verses of the Quran and Hadith. Here are some key points regarding these consequences:

1. **Hellfire**: The Quran describes Hell (Jahannam) as the ultimate consequence for those who deny God's signs and engage in wrongdoing. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:39) mentions that those who disbelieve will dwell eternally in the Fire.

2. **Divine Punishment**: In this world and the Hereafter, ungodly behavior can lead to various forms of punishment. This can manifest as trials, suffering, or misguidance in life, as emphasized in Surah Al-Anfal (8:53).

3. **Separation from Godâ€™s Mercy**: Those who reject faith may find themselves distanced from God's mercy and guidance, leading to a lack of fulfillment and spiritual peace as mentioned in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:52).

4. **Loss of Good Deeds**: In Surah Al-Kahf (18:105), it is mentioned that the deeds of those who do not believe are like mirages that vanish, emphasizing that their actions without faith do not lead to rewards.

5. **Accountability on the Day of Judgment**: Islamic belief holds that all individuals will be held accountable for their actions on the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah). Surah Al-Zalzalah (99:7-8) points out that everyone will see the consequences of their deeds.

6. **Temptation of the Devil**: The Quran warns of the influence of Shaytan (the Devil) on those who are ungodly, leading them further away from the truth and into destruction, as seen in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:268).

In summary, the consequences for ungodly people in Islamic teachings encompass both immediate worldly repercussions and eternal outcomes in the Hereafter. However, it is also essential to remember that God is Most Merciful, and repentance (tawbah) is always an option for those who seek forgiveness and strive to return to a righteous path.
