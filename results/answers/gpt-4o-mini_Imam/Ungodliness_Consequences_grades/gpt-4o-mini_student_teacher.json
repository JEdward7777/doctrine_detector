  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the consequences for ungodly people in Islamic teachings, addressing various aspects such as Hellfire, divine punishment, separation from God's mercy, loss of good deeds, accountability on the Day of Judgment, and the temptation of the Devil. However, the student did not directly address the concern of awareness of the spiritual ramifications of living in disobedience to God from a Christian perspective. The response focused more on Islamic beliefs rather than evaluating the consequences from a Christian worldview, therefore the grade is lower."
