  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the consequences for ungodly people in Islamic teachings, demonstrating a clear awareness of the spiritual ramifications of living in disobedience to God. The points presented align well with the given answer about God pronouncing judgment and wrath on those who reject Him. The inclusion of relevant Quranic references enhances the credibility and depth of the response. The only minor suggestion would be to further emphasize the need for repentance and reconciliation with God as a potential way to avoid or mitigate these consequences."
