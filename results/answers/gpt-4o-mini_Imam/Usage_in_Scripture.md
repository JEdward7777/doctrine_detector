## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
The term "Holy One" is used in both the Old and New Testaments, often to refer to God but also occasionally applied to individuals or certain contexts.

### Old Testament

1. **God**: The term "Holy One" frequently refers to God Himself. It emphasizes His purity, separateness from sin, and His sacredness. For example, in Isaiah 30:11, God is called the "Holy One of Israel," signifying His uniqueness and moral perfection.

2. **Prophets and Kings**: Sometimes, the term may refer to individuals whom God has set apart for a specific purpose. For instance, in Psalm 16:10, David refers to the Holy One, which is often interpreted as a reference to God but can also have implications for the anointed ones or prophets.

3. **Israel**: In certain contexts, Israel itself is called a holy people, which signifies their chosen status by God (Exodus 19:6).

### New Testament

1. **Jesus Christ**: The most significant use of the term in the New Testament is in reference to Jesus. He is often called the "Holy One of God" (Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34), which emphasizes His divine nature and sinlessness.

2. **Believers**: The term can also be applied to believers in Christ as they are called to be holy (1 Peter 1:15-16). The concept is that believers, through faith, are seen as set apart for God's purposes.

3. **Holy Spirit**: The Holy Spirit is referred to as holy, emphasizing His role in guiding believers and imparting holiness to them (Acts 1:8).

### Conclusion

In both Testaments, "Holy One" signifies a state of purity, separation from sin, and divine purpose. In a Muslim context, while we do not hold the Old and New Testaments as our primary texts, we recognize that these scriptures contribute to the understanding of God's holiness, which resonates with the attributes of Allah as described in the Quran. Allah is often described as "the Most Holy" (Al-Quddus), emphasizing His perfect purity and transcendence.
