The explanation is clear and supported with relevant scriptural examples. However, the conclusion draws a parallel with a Muslim context, stating that Allah is often described as \"the Most Holy,\" which may not align doctrinally with a Christian worldview that maintains the distinctiveness of the Trinity. This inclusion detracts from the overall theological coherence within a Christian-specific grading context."
