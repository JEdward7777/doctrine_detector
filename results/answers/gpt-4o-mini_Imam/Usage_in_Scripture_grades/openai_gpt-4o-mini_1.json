The inclusion of Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament is well articulated, emphasizing His divinity and sinlessness. The connection between the concept of holiness in Christianity and its resonance with the attributes of Allah in a Muslim context is also insightful. However, the response could have delved deeper into the divinity of Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament, exploring further the theological implications of this title in relation to his authority and unique role in salvation."
