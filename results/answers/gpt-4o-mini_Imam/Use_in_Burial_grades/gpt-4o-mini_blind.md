Myrrh, a resin obtained from the Commiphora tree, was highly valued in ancient times for its aromatic properties and medicinal uses. In the context of burial practices during biblical times, myrrh was primarily used for several key purposes:

1. **Embalming and Preservation**: Myrrh was one of the substances used in the process of embalming the dead. Its antiseptic and preservative qualities helped to inhibit decomposition, making it an essential component in the preparation of bodies for burial.

2. **Fragrance**: Myrrh had a pleasant aroma and was often used to mask the odor of decay. This fragrant quality made it a suitable choice for enhancing the overall scent of burial preparations.

3. **Symbol of Mourning and Respect**: The inclusion of myrrh in burial rites also had symbolic significance. It represented honor and respect for the deceased, highlighting the importance of the personâ€™s life.

In the New Testament, myrrh is notably mentioned as one of the gifts presented to Jesus by the Magi (wise men) at His birth (Matthew 2:11), which foreshadows its connection to death and burial, as it was also used in preparation for His burial (John 19:39, where Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes for the burial of Jesus).

Overall, myrrh played a multifaceted role in burial practices, reflecting both practical and symbolic aspects in the ancient context. Its use in these practices can serve as a reminder of the cultural customs surrounding death and the afterlife in biblical traditions.
