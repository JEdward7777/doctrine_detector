  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response provides a good overview of myrrh's uses in ancient burial practices, highlighting its antiseptic properties, pleasant aroma, and symbolic significance. The connection to Jesus' birth and burial is also a valuable addition.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more thoroughly addressing the concern about recognizing customs surrounding burial practices. While it mentions some cultural aspects, such as the importance of respect for the deceased, it does not fully explore how these customs can enhance comprehension of biblical contexts. The response could benefit from more specific examples or analysis of how understanding ancient burial practices can inform our interpretation of scriptural passages.\n\nOverall, the grade reflects the response's clear and informative presentation, but also acknowledges room for improvement in addressing the concern about cultural context."
