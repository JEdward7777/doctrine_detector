  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a general overview of how John the Baptist and Jesus are viewed in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, with some accurate information about Jesus being referred to as \"Rabbi\" in the New Testament. However, the response lacked depth and clarity in explaining the significance of the title \"Rabbi\" in relation to Jesus and John the Baptist within a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student missed an opportunity to discuss the theological implications of Jesus being referred to as \"Rabbi\" in the context of his divinity and role as the Messiah. More detailed explanation and integration of Christian doctrine would have improved this response."
