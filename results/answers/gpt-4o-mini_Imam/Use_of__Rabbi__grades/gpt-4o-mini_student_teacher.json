  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides some relevant information about the titles and roles of John the Baptist and Jesus in different religious traditions. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The focus on the differences in how the title \"Rabbi\" is understood in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity detracts from addressing the specific concern provided. The answer would have been stronger if it had specifically discussed how the title \"Rabbi\" reflected the respect and authority given to Jesus and John in their teachings, as stated in the reference answer."
