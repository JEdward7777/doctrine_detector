## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the Islamic tradition, John the Baptist (known as Yahya in Arabic) and Jesus (known as Isa) are both highly respected prophets. However, their titles and roles differ from the interpretation found in Judaism and Christianity.

In the New Testament, Jesus was often referred to as "Rabbi," which means "teacher" or "master" in Hebrew. This title signified his role as a teacher of the Torah and spiritual leader among the people. John the Baptist, on the other hand, is not commonly referred to with the title "Rabbi" in the same manner, but he is recognized for his role in preparing the way for Jesus and preaching repentance.

In Islam, both prophets are acknowledged for their piety and guidance, but the concept of "Rabbi" as understood in Judaism does not carry the same significance. Instead, they are considered as messengers who conveyed God's message to the people. In Islamic thought, the focus is on their prophethood and the messages they delivered, rather than specific titles they might have held in their respective cultures.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer provides some relevant information about the titles and roles of John the Baptist and Jesus in different religious traditions. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The focus on the differences in how the title "Rabbi" is understood in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity detracts from addressing the specific concern provided. The answer would have been stronger if it had specifically discussed how the title "Rabbi" reflected the respect and authority given to Jesus and John in their teachings, as stated in the reference answer.
