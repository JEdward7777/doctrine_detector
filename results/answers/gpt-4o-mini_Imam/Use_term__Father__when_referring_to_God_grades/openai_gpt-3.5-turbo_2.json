However, it does not directly address the concern that avoiding the term \"Father\" could lead to theological inaccuracies and dilute the scriptural message. While it is important to maintain clarity about Islamic beliefs, it is also crucial to consider the theological implications of deviating from scriptural language. Further exploration or consideration of this concern would have strengthened the response."
