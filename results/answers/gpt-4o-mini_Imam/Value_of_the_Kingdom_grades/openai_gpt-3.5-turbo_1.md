# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In the teachings of Jesus, as recorded in the New Testament, He often used parables to illustrate the value of the Kingdom of God. Here are a few notable examples:

1. **The Parable of the Hidden Treasure** (Matthew 13:44): This parable describes a man who finds a treasure hidden in a field. Out of joy, he sells all that he has to buy that field. This illustrates the immense value of the Kingdom of God, highlighting that it is worth sacrificing everything else.

2. **The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price** (Matthew 13:45-46): In this parable, a merchant seeks fine pearls and when he finds one of great value, he sells all his possessions to purchase it. This reflects the idea that the Kingdom of God is the most precious thing one can obtain, warranting total commitment.

3. **The Parable of the Mustard Seed** (Matthew 13:31-32): Jesus compares the Kingdom of God to a mustard seed, which is small when planted but grows into a large tree. This serves to illustrate how the Kingdom may start small but can grow to become something significant and influential.

4. **The Parable of the Leaven** (Matthew 13:33): Jesus compares the Kingdom to leaven that a woman mixes into flour until it is all fermented. This indicates how the Kingdom of God can subtly and profoundly influence the world around it.

5. **The Parable of the Weeds** (Matthew 13:24-30): In this parable, Jesus discusses the coexistence of good and evil until the time of harvest. This highlights the patience and justice of God's Kingdom in dealing with the complexities of human life.

These parables demonstrate a variety of insights into the nature and worth of the Kingdom of God, encouraging listeners to recognize its significance and to seek it earnestly. 

In Islamic teachings, while the figure of Jesus (known as 'Isa) is highly revered and recognized as a prophet, the emphasis on the Kingdom of God is often paralleled with the teachings of the Qur'an concerning the value of faith, righteousness, and the hereafter.
