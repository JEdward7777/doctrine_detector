## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Imam](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Imam.md)
In Islamic belief, God has promised that Satan, also known as Iblis, will ultimately be defeated and will not succeed in leading the believers astray from the path of righteousness. This defeat is both a certainty in the end times and a part of the divine plan.

One of the key pieces of evidence for this promise can be found in the Qur'an. For instance, in Surah Al-Hijr (15:39-40), Iblis himself states, "Because You have sent me astray, I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path," and then he goes on to declare his intention to mislead humanity. However, the ultimate defeat and punishment of Iblis is assured in various verses, such as:

- Surah Al-Saffat (37:62-65): Here, it describes the fate of the disbelievers and their ultimate condemnation to Hell.
- Surah Al-Baqarah (2:208) encourages believers to enter into peace and guidance fully, suggesting clearly that those who follow God's guidance will be protected from the snares of Satan.

Additionally, on the Day of Judgment, there are accounts in the Qur'an (such as Surah Al-A'raf 7:22-23) where Satan admits his role in misleading humanity, yet turns the blame onto humans for choosing to follow him instead of God’s guidance. 

The final defeat of Satan serves as a reminder of the importance of seeking guidance and remaining steadfast in faith. It reinforces the idea that while Satan may have influence in this worldly life, true victory lies with those who follow Allah's path and hold fast to His commandments.
