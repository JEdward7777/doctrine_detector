  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding the defeat of Satan (Iblis), the question specifically asked for the Christian perspective on God's promise regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan. The response does not address Christianity or provide any information about God's promise in Christian doctrine. The student has demonstrated good knowledge of Islamic beliefs, but the lack of addressing the question's Christian context significantly impacts the grade."
