  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful analysis of the defeat of Satan in Islamic belief, citing relevant Quranic verses. However, the answer did not align with the Christian-specific worldview, as it focused on Islamic teachings rather than the promise regarding the Messiah defeating Satan as specified in the reference answer. Additional points could have been awarded if the student had demonstrated an understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic."
