  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Islamic perspective on the ultimate defeat of Satan. It provides textual evidence from the Qur'an to support the claim that God has promised the defeat of Satan. However, the answer is outside the scope of the Christian specific worldview that was specified in the grading criteria."
