In Islamic theology, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is revered as a prophet and messenger, but the narrative surrounding his death differs fundamentally from that in Christian belief. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus was not crucified nor did he die on the cross; instead, it is believed that he was raised to heaven by Allah. The Quran states in Surah An-Nisa (4:157-158):

> "And [for] their saying, 'Indeed, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary,' and they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him; but [another] was made to resemble him to them. And indeed, those who differ over it are in doubt. They have no knowledge of it except the following of assumption. And they did not kill him, for certain. Rather, Allah raised him to Himself..."

From an Islamic perspective, this means that Jesus' death on the cross does not have the same significance regarding Satan's dominion as it does in Christian theology. In Christianity, Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection are seen as a triumph over sin and death, symbolizing the defeat of Satan and the opening of the way to salvation for humanity.

In Islam, the defeat of Satan is understood through the teachings of Islam itself, primarily through submission to Allah (God) and following the guidance of His prophets, including Jesus but not limited to him. The core belief in the oneness of God (Tawhid) and adherence to His commandments lead to the rejection of Satan's influence in the lives of believers. 

Muslims believe that Satan (Iblis) is a constant adversary, attempting to lead people astray, but ultimately, he has no control over those who are sincerely devoted to Allah. The ultimate victory over evil comes through faith, righteousness, and adherence to God's guidance, rather than through a singular event like the crucifixion.

In summary, from an Islamic viewpoint, the significance of Jesus' death on the cross concerning Satan's dominion is not acknowledged, as Jesus was not crucified according to Islamic belief. Instead, the focus is on Allah's sovereignty and the power of faith and righteous deeds to overcome evil.

Grade: 30

Comment: The student provided an insightful comparison between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' death on the cross and its significance concerning Satan's dominion. However, the student's answer primarily focused on Islamic theology rather than addressing the given question from a Christian perspective. The answer did not clearly connect Jesus' victory over Satan through His death on the cross to the implications for believers and their spiritual life as required. The Christian worldview emphasizes that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was the ultimate triumph over sin and evil, securing redemption for believers and providing victory over Satan's dominion. The student's response would have been stronger if it directly addressed the Christian understanding of Jesus' victory and its impact on believers' spiritual lives.
