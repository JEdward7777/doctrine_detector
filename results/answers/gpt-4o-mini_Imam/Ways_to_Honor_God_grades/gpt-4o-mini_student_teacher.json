  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful list of practical ways individuals, including Christians, can honor God in their daily lives. While the student did not explicitly mention the importance of thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and showcasing His greatness as the reference answer suggests, the student's suggestions align with Christian values and principles. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of actionable expressions of faith and worship in everyday life, although there is room for improvement by including more specific Christian teachings and practices."
