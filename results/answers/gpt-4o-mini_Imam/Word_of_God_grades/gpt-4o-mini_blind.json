The connection to the Gospel of John's prologue is appropriately included. However, the response could have been enhanced by delving deeper into the authority and infallibility of the Bible as the written Word of God. Additionally, while acknowledging the importance of the Quran from a Muslim perspective is relevant, it slightly detracts from the central focus on the Christian understanding of the term \"Word of God.\""
