  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively identifies a variety of modern examples of idols that can distract from devotion to God, including materialism, celebrity culture, technology, success, relationships, personal desires, and political ideologies. They provide clear explanations for each example, connecting them to the concept of idol worship in a Christian context. However, the inclusion of Islamic perspective and the broader context slightly detracts from the focus on Christian-specific worldview. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concern and provides insightful examples."
