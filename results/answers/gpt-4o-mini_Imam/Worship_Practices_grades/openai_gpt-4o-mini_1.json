  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of modern idols that can potentially distract Christians and Muslims from their devotion to God. It expands on the various forms these idols can take and emphasizes the importance of reflecting on priorities. The response aligns well with the concern provided and offers relevant examples to support the argument from a Christian worldview. However, to further enhance the grade, the response could have included more direct references to biblical teachings or scriptures that address idolatry, reinforcing the Christian perspective."
