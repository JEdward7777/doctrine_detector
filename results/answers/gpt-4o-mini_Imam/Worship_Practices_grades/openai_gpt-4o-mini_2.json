  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 90.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive list of modern idols that can distract individuals from their relationship with God, showing a deep understanding of the concern about prioritizing devotion to God. The examples given are relevant and insightful, illustrating how various aspects of contemporary culture can unknowingly lead to idolatry. The mention of the importance for Christians to reflect on their priorities and ensure their devotion remains focused on God aligns well with the concern given. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview, offering a thoughtful and thorough analysis.\n\nGreat job overall, with just a small deduction for not explicitly tying the concept of idolatry back to the larger theological implications for Christians."
