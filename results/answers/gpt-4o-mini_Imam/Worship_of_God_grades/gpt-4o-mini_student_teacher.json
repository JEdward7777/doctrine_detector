  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on worship and false gods, as well as briefly touches on the Biblical perspective. However, the response does not directly address the concern about avoiding idolatry in our lives and could benefit from explicit connections to how recognizing the importance of worshiping the true God helps in this regard. Additionally, while the student includes relevant verses from the Quran and Bible, the focus could be more on the specific concern raised in the question."
