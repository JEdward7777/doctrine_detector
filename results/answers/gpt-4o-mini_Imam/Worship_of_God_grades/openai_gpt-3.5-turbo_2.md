In Islam, the purpose of human creation is fundamentally tied to the worship of Allah (God). This is supported by the Quran, particularly in Surah Adh-Dhariyat (51:56), where Allah states, "And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me." This verse signifies that worship is the primary purpose of life, and it encompasses all actions performed with the intention of pleasing God. Worship in Islam is not limited to ritual acts like prayer or fasting; it also includes living a life of righteousness, justice, and compassion.

As for the concept of false gods, Islam strongly emphasizes the oneness of God (Tawhid) and categorically rejects the worship of anything or anyone other than Allah. The Quran includes numerous verses that warn against shirk (associating partners with God), which is considered one of the gravest sins. For instance, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:22) states, "He who created for you that which is on the earth entirely, then He directed Himself to the heaven and made them seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things."

In the Bible, the issue of false gods is also addressed. The First Commandment states, "You shall have no other gods before me" (Exodus 20:3), which emphasizes the importance of worshiping the one true God and not dividing one's devotion among multiple deities. Throughout the Bible, there are various warnings against idolatry and the worship of false gods (for example, in Isaiah 44:9-20, where the futility of idol worship is discussed).

In summary, both the Quran and the Bible share the belief that humanity is created to worship God alone, and they both caution against the worship of false gods, emphasizing the importance of monotheism and devotion to the Creator.
