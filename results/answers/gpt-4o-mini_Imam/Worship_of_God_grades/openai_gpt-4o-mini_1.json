It also aptly connects this to the Christian perspective by mentioning the First Commandment and references to idolatry in the Bible. The linkage between worshiping the true God and avoiding idolatry aligns well with the specified concern. The integration of both religious viewpoints enriches the understanding of the significance of worshiping God in monotheism and rejecting false gods."
