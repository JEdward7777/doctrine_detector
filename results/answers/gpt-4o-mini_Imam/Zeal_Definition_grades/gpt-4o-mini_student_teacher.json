  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of zeal in the context of Christian teachings, highlighting its significance in faith and devotion to God. They also correctly pointed out the importance of tempering zeal with wisdom, compassion, and understanding in line with biblical teachings. However, the student slightly deviated from the biblical context by expanding the discussion to include references to Islam, which may dilute the clarity of the Christian perspective on zeal."
