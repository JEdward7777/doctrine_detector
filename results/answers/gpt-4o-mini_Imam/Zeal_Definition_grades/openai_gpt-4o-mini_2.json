The mention of the teachings of Jesus on love and humility further reinforces the holistic view of zeal within Christianity. Additionally, the comparison with Islam's concept of 'ijazah' adds a comparative perspective. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the importance of biblical context for the proper application of zeal in a believer's life."
