  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: \nThe student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of the Mercy Seat in the context of the Ark of the Covenant, touching upon important theological aspects such as divine presence, atonement, reconciliation, and centrality in worship. However, deducting points for the statement regarding Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the foreshadowing of redemption in Islam, as this does not align with Christian doctrine. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic beliefs detracts from the Christian-specific worldview needed in this response. Otherwise, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic."
