However, the inclusion of references to Prophet Muhammad and Islamic teachings in relation to the atonement theme deviates from the Christian worldview focus on the Old Testament symbolism of atonement and God's mercy. It is important to maintain a Christian specific perspective when discussing theological concepts within a Christian worldview."
