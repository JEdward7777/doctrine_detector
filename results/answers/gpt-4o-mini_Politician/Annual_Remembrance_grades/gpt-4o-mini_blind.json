The student accurately identifies key reasons for the annual observance rooted in biblical and theological principles. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the student could have further emphasized the sacrificial aspect of the Passover lamb as a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice for sin, highlighting the connection between the Old Testament practice and the fulfillment in the New Testament. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references to support the points made would strengthen the theological foundation of the response."
