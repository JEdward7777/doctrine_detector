The commandment for the Israelites to celebrate Passover annually is rooted in the biblical narrative of the Exodus, where they were liberated from slavery in Egypt. Passover serves multiple significant purposes:

1. **Remembrance of Liberation**: The celebration is a way to remember and honor the liberation of the Israelites from oppression. It emphasizes the importance of freedom and the struggle against injustice.

2. **Family and Community**: Passover fosters a sense of unity and community, as families and friends gather to share the Seder meal, engage in rituals, and recount the Exodus story. This practice helps to strengthen cultural and familial bonds.

3. **Religious Identity**: The observance of Passover helps to instill and reinforce Jewish identity and traditions among the community. It serves as a reminder of their unique covenantal relationship with God and their historical journey.

4. **Education for Future Generations**: The rituals and storytelling involved in Passover serve an educational purpose, allowing each generation to learn about their history and values. This ensures that the lessons of resilience and faith are passed down.

Overall, the annual celebration of Passover is a deeply meaningful tradition that embodies themes of freedom, remembrance, and community.

Comments: 
This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the Passover celebration for the Israelites. The student accurately identifies key reasons for the annual observance rooted in biblical and theological principles. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the student could have further emphasized the sacrificial aspect of the Passover lamb as a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice for sin, highlighting the connection between the Old Testament practice and the fulfillment in the New Testament. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references to support the points made would strengthen the theological foundation of the response.
