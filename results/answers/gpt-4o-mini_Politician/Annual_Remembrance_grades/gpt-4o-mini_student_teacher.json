While the response is well-thought-out and demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of Passover, it falls short of directly addressing the concern of recognizing the importance of remembrance in Christian faith. Integrating a Christian perspective, such as linking Passover to the broader narrative of God's deliverance and victory, would have strengthened the answer."
