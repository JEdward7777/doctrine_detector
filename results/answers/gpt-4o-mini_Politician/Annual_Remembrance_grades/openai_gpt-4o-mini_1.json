The connection to God's victory over the Egyptians and deliverance from slavery is well articulated in the context of remembrance, aligning with the importance of remembrance in the Christian faith. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the parallel between the Israelites' remembrance of Passover and the Christian emphasis on remembering God's faithfulness and salvation through Jesus Christ."
