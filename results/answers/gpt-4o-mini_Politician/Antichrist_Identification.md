## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
According to the Apostle John, particularly in the New Testament letters, a person is defined as an antichrist primarily by their denial of the foundational truths about Christ. In 1 John 2:22, for example, it states that an antichrist is one who denies the Father and the Son. The term signifies those who oppose or misrepresent the core beliefs of Christianity, particularly regarding the nature and identity of Jesus Christ. It's important to approach such discussions with sensitivity, recognizing the diversity of beliefs and interpretations within different faith communities. Engaging in these conversations with respect and openness can foster understanding and dialogue.
