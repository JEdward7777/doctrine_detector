The student effectively covers key aspects such as the foundational role of the apostles in the early Church, their witness to the resurrection, the universal mission of the gospel, empowerment through the Holy Spirit, the model of discipleship they offer, and their engagement with different cultures. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications of Jesus commissioning the apostles and effectively connects it to the broader mission of the Church. Great job!"
