  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the gospel. They discussed various aspects such as the foundation of the Church, witness to the resurrection, universal mission, empowerment through the Holy Spirit, model of discipleship, and cultural engagement. However, the response lacked emphasis on the central authority given to the apostles by Christ and the crucial role they played in the establishment and expansion of the early church, as highlighted in the reference answer. It is important to ensure that these key points are given more prominence in the explanation."
