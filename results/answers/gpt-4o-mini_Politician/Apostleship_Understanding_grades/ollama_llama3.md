## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response exceeds expectations by providing a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus. It covers various aspects, including the foundation of the Church, witness to the Resurrection, universal mission, empowerment through the Holy Spirit, model of discipleship, and cultural engagement. The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission.

The only areas for improvement are minor omissions and lack of direct connection to the concern about the Great Commission. While the response mentions the mission being "crucial for the establishment and expansion of the early church," it could be further developed to explicitly link this to the concept of the Great Commission. Additionally, some points (e.g., cultural engagement) might not be directly related to the main concern.

Overall, however, this response provides a thoughtful and detailed exploration of the significance of apostleship, and its connection to the Great Commission is implicit rather than explicit.
