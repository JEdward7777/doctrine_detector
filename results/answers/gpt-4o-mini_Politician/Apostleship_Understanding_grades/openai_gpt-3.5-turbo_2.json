  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in the context of the Great Commission. The student effectively expands upon the foundational role of the apostles in the early Church, their witness to the resurrection, the universal nature of their mission, empowerment through the Holy Spirit, modeling discipleship, and engaging with diverse cultures. The use of Scripture and theological reflection align well with a Christian worldview, demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic. The response could have further emphasized the fulfillment of Jesus' command to make disciples of all nations as a central aspect of the apostles' mission, but overall, this is a strong and well-supported answer."
