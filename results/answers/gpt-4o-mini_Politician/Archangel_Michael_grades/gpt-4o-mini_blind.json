It accurately mentions Michael's appearances in the Book of Daniel, the Epistle of Jude, and the Book of Revelation, along with his role in spiritual warfare and protection of Israel. However, while acknowledging the importance of sensitivity in discussing religious topics, it could have included more emphasis on the biblical context and significance of Michael as an archangel in Christian theology."
