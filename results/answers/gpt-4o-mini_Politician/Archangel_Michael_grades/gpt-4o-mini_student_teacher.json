  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and accurate answer to the question, correctly identifying Michael as the only angel referred to as an 'archangel' in the Bible. They also acknowledge Michael's significance in spiritual warfare and intercession. The mention of sensitivity towards different religious traditions shows respect and understanding. Great job, with just a minor suggestion to elaborate further on Michael's role in spiritual warfare and intercession to strengthen the answer."
