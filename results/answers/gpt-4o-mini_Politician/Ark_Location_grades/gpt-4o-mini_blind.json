  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the location of the Ark of the Covenant in the tabernacle, highlighting its significance as the representation of God's presence and a central symbol of worship for the Israelites. The mention of sensitivity towards discussions of religious artifacts is commendable but not necessary for answering the question directly. Overall, a solid response with doctrinal correctness."
