The Ark of the Covenant was located in the innermost chamber of the Tabernacle, known as the Most Holy Place or the Holy of Holies. This sacred space was separated by a veil and housed the Ark, which contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments, among other significant items. The Ark represented the presence of God and was a central symbol of worship for the Israelites.
