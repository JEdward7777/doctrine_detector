3. **Presence of the Holy Spirit**: It's commonly believed that the Holy Spirit dwells within believers, providing guidance, comfort, and strength in their spiritual journey.

4. **Community and Support**: Being part of a faith community provides believers with fellowship, encouragement, and support from others who share similar beliefs.

These points highlight the positive aspects of belief in Jesus, focusing on faith, community, and the promise of spiritual fulfillment. It's important to approach this topic with sensitivity, recognizing the diversity of beliefs and practices within Christianity and among other faiths.
