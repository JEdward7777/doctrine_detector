  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the interconnectedness of atonement, forgiveness, and reconciliation in Christianity. The student effectively articulates the theological significance of each concept and their roles in restoring relationships with God and others. The submission could have been strengthened by incorporating biblical references to support the claims made and deepen the theological underpinnings of the discussion. Overall, a clear and coherent response that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
