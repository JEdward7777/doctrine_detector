  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-written response that captures the essence of Romans 12:9 and highlights the importance of authentic love. Their explanation expands on the reference answer by emphasizing the alignment of intentions and actions with values and the fostering of transparency and kindness. However, the student's response could have been improved by explicitly connecting the concept of authentic love to being effective representatives of Christ's love in the world, as per the provided concern. Overall, a solid understanding and application of the biblical principle, but slightly lacking in the focus on living out faith authentically."
