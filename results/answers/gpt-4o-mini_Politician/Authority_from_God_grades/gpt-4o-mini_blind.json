  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe answer effectively explains the concept of divine authority and its significance in the life of a believer from a general religious perspective. It covers various important aspects such as moral framework, purpose, community, hope, and accountability well.\n\nFrom a Christian worldview, the answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning the Christian understanding of divine authority grounded in the Word of God, the Bible. Adding references to specific Christian teachings or doctrines that elaborate on divine authority would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, but there is room for improvement by incorporating more specifically Christian teachings on divine authority."
