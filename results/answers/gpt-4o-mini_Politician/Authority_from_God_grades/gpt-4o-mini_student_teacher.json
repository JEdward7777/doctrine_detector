  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 80.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive understanding of divine authority, highlighting its significance for believers in various aspects of their lives. They outlined key points such as moral framework, purpose, community, hope, and accountability, demonstrating a thorough grasp of the topic. However, the response could have been improved by directly tying the definition and significance of divine authority back to the concern provided. Additionally, a more explicit connection to how divine authority influences believers' discernment of God's will and obedience could have strengthened the overall response."
