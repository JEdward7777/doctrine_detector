  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of explaining what divine authority means, including its significance for believers across different traditions. It also provides examples of how divine authority can shape an individual's life and practices. The response is clear and concise, making it easy to follow along.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not directly address the concern about understanding divine authority helping believers discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. While the response touches on some of these themes (e.g., providing a moral framework and promoting accountability), it does not explicitly connect these ideas to the concern.\n\nTo earn a higher grade, the response could provide more explicit examples or explanations about how understanding divine authority helps believers navigate difficult decisions or maintain obedience in their faith journey. Nonetheless, the response is strong overall, and with some minor adjustments, it could be even more effective at addressing the concern."
