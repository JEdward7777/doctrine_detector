It effectively highlights how understanding divine authority can aid believers in discerning God's will and maintaining obedience in their faith journey. The inclusion of various aspects such as moral framework, purpose, community, hope, and accountability demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more Scripture references or theological insights specific to the Christian faith to further strengthen the response."
