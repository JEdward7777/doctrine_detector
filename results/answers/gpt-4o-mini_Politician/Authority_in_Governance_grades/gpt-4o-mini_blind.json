It accurately references key passages such as Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:13-17, highlighting the divine origin of authority and the call for submission to governmental rulers. The explanation is well-supported and acknowledges the contextual nuances of these teachings. The only suggestion for improvement would be to reinforce the Christian perspective on the inherent responsibilities and limitations of governmental authority as ordained by God in line with biblical principles."
