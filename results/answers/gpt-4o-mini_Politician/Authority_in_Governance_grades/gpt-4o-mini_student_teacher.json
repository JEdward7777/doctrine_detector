  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer referencing key biblical passages on the authority of governing rulers. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey as requested in the concern. While they did mention the submission to human authorities for the Lord's sake, the emphasis on the divine origin of authority and the responsibility to obey was not as prominent as in the provided reference answer."
