  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively draws on biblical passages such as Romans 13:1-7 to support the notion that governing rulers derive their authority from God. It also acknowledges the importance of obeying human authorities as a reflection of obeying God. The reference to interpreting these scriptures within their historical and cultural context adds depth to the analysis. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the God-ordained structure of authority and the responsibility to obey, while also considering different perspectives on the topic."
