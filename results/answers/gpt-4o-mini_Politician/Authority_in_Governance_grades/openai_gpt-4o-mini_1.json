The references to both Romans and 1 Peter show an understanding of the Christian worldview on authority and submission. The mention of interpreting the texts in their historical context also demonstrates a thoughtful approach. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey."
