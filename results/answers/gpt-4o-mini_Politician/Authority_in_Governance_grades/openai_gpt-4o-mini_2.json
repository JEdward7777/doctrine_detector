  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively provides biblical references and insights regarding the authority of governing rulers as established by God. It acknowledges the importance of obeying human authorities as a reflection of obedience to God's ordained structure of authority. The response also emphasizes the balance between respect for authority and the accountability of rulers to uphold justice and righteousness. A slightly higher grade could have been given if there was more direct integration of the concern into the response."
