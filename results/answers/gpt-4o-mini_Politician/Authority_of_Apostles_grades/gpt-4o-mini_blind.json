  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer effectively demonstrates an understanding of the relationship between the authority of the apostles, their ability to perform miracles, and preach boldly within a theological framework. The response appropriately emphasizes the spiritual and communal dimensions of the apostles' authority and ties it to their commissioning by Jesus Christ. The student's explanation of miracles as affirmations of authority and validations of the apostles' messages is insightful. The inclusion of the apostles' role as leaders within early Christian communities adds depth to the discussion. However, to enhance the grade, the student could have delved deeper into specific examples of apostolic miracles or bold preaching from the New Testament to provide more concrete support for their points."
