  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65/100\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive analysis of the authority of the apostles and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. They effectively discuss the theological perspective and the importance of miracles in affirming their authority. However, the student could improve by focusing more explicitly on the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles by God through Jesus. Additionally, the student's answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to specific Biblical references that highlight the authority given to the apostles by Jesus."
