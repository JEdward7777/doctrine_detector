The author effectively highlights the connection between the apostles' miracles, bold preaching, and their divine commissioning by Jesus Christ.\n\nThe response scores high marks in addressing the concern, as it explicitly discusses the apostles' empowerment by God to perform miracles and preach boldly, which is in line with the given answer. The text also provides a clear theological framework for understanding the apostles' authority, citing their close relationship with Jesus Christ and the divine commissioning they received.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, the response could delve deeper into the communal dimension of the apostles' authority, exploring how it was exercised within early Christian communities. Additionally, some supporting biblical references or examples would strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical narrative and its implications for understanding the apostles' authority."
