  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the significance of the term \"Yahweh of hosts\" in relation to God's authority over spiritual beings. It correctly points out God's supreme sovereignty and power over all celestial and spiritual realms. The student effectively acknowledges the divine leadership and control implied by this title. The response could be further strengthened by including scriptural references to support the assertions made. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept but could benefit from more specific biblical backing."
