The student effectively connects the title to broader themes of prophecy fulfillment, universal kingship, spiritual leadership, sovereignty over creation, transformation, and the call to unity. However, the answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the unique Christian perspective that Jesus' authority extends over all creation because of His divine nature as the Son of God. Additionally, while acknowledging diverse beliefs is important, it is also crucial to emphasize the foundational Christian belief in the exclusivity of Jesus as the only way to salvation. The discussion could be enhanced by specifically highlighting Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection as central to His Kingship and authority over all creation."
