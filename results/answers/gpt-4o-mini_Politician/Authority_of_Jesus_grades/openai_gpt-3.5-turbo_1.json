It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding Jesus' authority and sovereignty in believers' lives. The inclusion of scriptural references and theological insights from a Christian worldview enhances the depth of the response. The response could have further emphasized the personal application of acknowledging Jesus' authority in believers' daily lives to strengthen the connection between the broader theological concepts discussed and individual faith practices."
