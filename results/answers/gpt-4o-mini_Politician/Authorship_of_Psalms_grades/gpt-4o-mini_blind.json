  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of the key figures traditionally attributed to writing the Psalms, including King David, Asaph, the sons of Korah, Solomon, and anonymous authors. The explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the diverse authorship within the Psalms. The only suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in guiding these individuals to write the Psalms, highlighting the divine element in the composition of these sacred texts."
