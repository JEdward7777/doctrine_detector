  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and apt answer by mentioning King David, Asaph, the sons of Korah, and Solomon as key figures traditionally attributed to writing the Psalms. They also acknowledged anonymous authors, emphasizing the diverse voices and experiences within the Psalms. While the student's answer exceeded the reference answer in terms of depth and explanation, they missed mentioning Moses as another key figure involved in writing the Psalms, as stated in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the authorship of the Psalms and how it enriches the understanding of their messages and themes."
