While sensitivity to diverse beliefs is important, they could emphasize the importance of conveying the true meaning of the term \"Son of God\" in translations.\n3. The response could benefit from a more explicit stance on whether 'Son of God' should be avoided in translations in polytheistic cultures, based on Christian doctrinal beliefs.\n\nOverall, the student's response shows consideration for cultural differences, but could strengthen their argument by grounding it more in Christian doctrine and providing a clearer stance on the use of the term \"Son of God\" in translations."
