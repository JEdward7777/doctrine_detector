While promoting understanding and respect among different cultures is commendable, the central issue of potential theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity in avoiding the term \"Son of God\" is not adequately addressed. The reference answer provides a more aligned perspective from a Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of teaching and explaining the true meaning of the term rather than avoiding it altogether."
