The suggestion to consider alternative phrases or explanations that convey the essence of the original term without causing confusion or misunderstanding is also a strong point.\n\nHowever, while the response acknowledges the importance of balance between accuracy and sensitivity, it may not go far enough in emphasizing the need for direct explanation and teaching about the term \"Son of God\". The original answer, which emphasizes careful teaching through context and explanation, seems more in line with addressing this concern. Therefore, I would deduct a few points for not fully embracing this approach.\n\nOverall, the response provides a thoughtful and balanced perspective on the issue, but could be improved by placing even greater emphasis on the importance of direct education about the term \"Son of God\"."
