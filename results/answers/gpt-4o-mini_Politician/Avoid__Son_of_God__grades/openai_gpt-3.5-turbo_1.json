The concern emphasizes the importance of not avoiding the term \"Son of God\" to prevent theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity, yet the response leans more towards avoiding the term rather than teaching its meaning through context and explanation. Therefore, the response does not align well with the concern provided. It is important to prioritize accuracy in conveying the core message of faith, especially when it comes to crucial terms like \"Son of God.\""
