However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern that avoidance can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. The response does not firmly assert the necessity of using the term itself and leans more towards accommodating cultural sensitivities, potentially risking diluting the truth of Jesus' identity. It could have been strengthened by emphasizing the importance of conveying the true meaning of \"Son of God\" despite cultural differences."
