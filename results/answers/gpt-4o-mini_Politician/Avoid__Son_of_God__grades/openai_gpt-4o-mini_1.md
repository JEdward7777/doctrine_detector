When considering the use of the term "Son of God" in translations, it is important to approach the topic with sensitivity to the diverse cultural and religious contexts in which these translations are being used. In polytheistic cultures, the phrase might carry connotations that differ significantly from its intended meaning within a monotheistic framework.

Engaging in dialogue with representatives from various cultural backgrounds can also provide valuable insights into how best to approach this issue.
