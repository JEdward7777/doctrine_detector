However, there is a lack of emphasis on the significance of the term within a monotheistic framework and the unique Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God. The focus on cultural sensitivity, while important, should not overshadow the core theological truths that Christians hold dear. A stronger emphasis on the biblical basis and importance of the term within the Christian faith would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
