  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the different methods of baptism mentioned in the Bible and offers insight into how they may be interpreted in various Christian contexts. The student effectively addresses the significance of immersion, affusion, and aspersion, along with theological interpretations such as believer's baptism and infant baptism. The inclusion of symbolism and the community role of baptism further enhances the discussion. The response could be improved by emphasizing the doctrinal importance of baptism within the context of salvation and its relation to the Christian's identity in Christ. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the Scriptural basis for each method of baptism and its theological implications would strengthen the response."
