It offers detailed insights into different practices within denominations and the theological significance behind them. The integration of Scriptural references and theological perspectives enhances the overall analysis. The only minor improvement could be a more explicit connection to the foundational Christian beliefs underpinning baptism as a sacrament, ensuring a stronger alignment with a Christian worldview."
