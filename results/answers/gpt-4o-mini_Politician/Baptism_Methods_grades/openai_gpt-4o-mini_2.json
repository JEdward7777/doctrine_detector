It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the interpretations and practices associated with immersion, pouring, and sprinkling baptism methods. The inclusion of theological perspectives and community roles enriches the explanation. The response could further benefit from explicitly connecting these interpretations and methods to core Christian beliefs and teachings, emphasizing the significance of baptism within the context of salvation and discipleship."
