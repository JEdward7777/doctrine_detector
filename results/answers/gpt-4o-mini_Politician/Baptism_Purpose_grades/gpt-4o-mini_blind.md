Baptism holds a significant place in the life of a Christian according to New Testament teachings, as it is seen as an important step in one’s faith journey. Here are several key points that highlight its significance:

5. **Command from Christ**: The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) includes the instruction to baptize all nations. This command underscores the importance of baptism as a central practice in the life of the Church.

6. **Spiritual Rebirth**: John 3:5 refers to being "born of water and the Spirit," highlighting baptism as integral to spiritual rebirth and the transformative experience of accepting Christ.

Overall, baptism is regarded as an essential rite of passage for Christians, encapsulating themes of faith, community, and obedience to Christ. It provides a profound way for believers to express their commitment to their faith and to mark the beginning of their discipleship journey.
