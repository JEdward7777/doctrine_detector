  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful explanation of the significance of baptism in the life of a Christian according to New Testament teachings. They have covered various aspects such as public declaration of faith, symbolism of purification and new life, following Jesus' example, incorporation into the community, the command from Christ, and spiritual rebirth. The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of baptism in the Christian faith, aligning well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. However, the response could have been strengthened by emphasizing more on the core message that baptism signifies cleansing from sin and union with Christ, which is the central theme of baptism according to Christian theology."
