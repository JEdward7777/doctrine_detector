## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the New Testament, repentance and baptism are closely interconnected as part of the process of spiritual transformation and commitment to faith. 

Repentance, which signifies a heartfelt turning away from sin and a genuine change of mind and heart toward God, is seen as a prerequisite for baptism. This is exemplified in the ministry of John the Baptist, who called for people to repent for the forgiveness of sins, emphasizing that baptism was a symbol of that repentance (Matthew 3:2, 3:11).

Similarly, after Jesus' resurrection, His disciples were instructed to preach repentance alongside baptism. For instance, in Luke 24:47, it states that repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be preached in His name to all nations, starting from Jerusalem. The book of Acts also highlights this relationship, particularly in Acts 2:38, where Peter tells the crowd to "repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins."

Baptism, therefore, serves as an outward expression of the inner change that has taken place through repentance. It symbolizes the believerâ€™s identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, signifying a new beginning and commitment to a life of faith.

In summary, the New Testament portrays repentance and baptism as integral components of the journey toward faith, with repentance prepared the heart for baptism and baptism publicly affirming the change that repentance signifies. Both are essential for experiencing the fullness of forgiveness and new life in Christ. This understanding fosters a welcoming approach to sharing these foundational tenets of faith with diverse communities.
