  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the relationship between repentance and baptism as presented in the New Testament. The student effectively conveys the importance of repentance as a precursor to baptism, citing relevant biblical passages and highlighting the symbolic significance of baptism in the believer's journey of faith. The answer could be strengthened by further emphasizing the biblical mandate for both repentance and baptism in the believer's life, but overall, it demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic."
