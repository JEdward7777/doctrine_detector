However, it delved more into the broader implications, such as personal relationships, sense of belonging, and moral responsibility, rather than solely focusing on the specific relationship with God through Jesus Christ. More emphasis on the central role of Jesus as the bridge to God would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective in this context."
