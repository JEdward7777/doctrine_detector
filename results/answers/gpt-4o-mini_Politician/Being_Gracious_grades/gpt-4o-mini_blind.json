However, from a Christian worldview, it could be enhanced by mentioning the biblical foundation of graciousness, such as how God's grace towards us should inspire us to extend grace to others. Additionally, discussing the concept of forgiveness and humility as integral aspects of gracious interactions would further strengthen the answer."
