The answer correctly identifies the Pharisees' belief in the resurrection of the dead and the existence of angels and demons, supported by references to Jewish Scriptures. The mention of the Pharisees' emphasis on living according to Jewish law and the concept of rewards in the afterlife adds depth to the explanation. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
