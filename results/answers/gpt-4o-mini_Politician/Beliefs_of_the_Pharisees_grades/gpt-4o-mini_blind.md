## [Answer](../Beliefs_of_the_Pharisees.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Pharisees, a prominent religious group during the Second Temple period in ancient Judea, held specific beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings that distinguished them from other groups of the time, such as the Sadducees. 

1. **Life After Death**: The Pharisees believed in an afterlife, including the resurrection of the dead. They posited that at the end of days, the righteous would be resurrected to enjoy eternal life. This belief was rooted in their interpretations of the Hebrew Scriptures, particularly within the prophetic texts, which they understood to imply the existence of an afterlife.

2. **Spiritual Beings**: The Pharisees acknowledged the existence of spiritual beings, including angels and demons. They believed that these beings played a role in the spiritual realm and could interact with humanity, influencing events both positively and negatively.

The teachings of the Pharisees focused on both the importance of living a life in accordance with Jewish law and the hope of rewards in the afterlife for those who led a righteous life. Their views contributed significantly to the development of later Jewish thought about spirituality and life after death.
