  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings during Jesus' time. The answer effectively explores these beliefs and clearly outlines the Pharisees' distinctive views within the context of ancient Judea. The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the subject matter and effectively connects the Pharisees' beliefs to their broader teachings and significance in shaping later Jewish thought. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to directly compare the student's answer to the provided reference answer to ensure all key points are covered."
