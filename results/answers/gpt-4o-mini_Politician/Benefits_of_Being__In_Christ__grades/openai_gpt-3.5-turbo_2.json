It connects these benefits to the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice, illustrating how a relationship with Christ can impact spiritual growth, community belonging, shared values and purpose, mutual support, opportunities for service, hope and resilience, forgiveness and love, as well as cultural and interfaith dialogue.
