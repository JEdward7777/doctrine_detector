It emphasizes the positive impacts on personal, communal, and societal levels. However, there is a slight deviation from the focus on the practical implications of a relationship with Christ as mentioned in the concern. The response could have tied the mentioned benefits more directly to the practical implications of knowing and trusting Christ as Savior, and the transformative power of His sacrifice."
