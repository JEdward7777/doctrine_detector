4. **Luke 6:37** - "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven." This verse illustrates the broader concept of grace and understanding within relationships.

5. **Matthew 18:21-22** - "Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?' Jesus answered, 'I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.'" This emphasizes the boundless nature of forgiveness.
