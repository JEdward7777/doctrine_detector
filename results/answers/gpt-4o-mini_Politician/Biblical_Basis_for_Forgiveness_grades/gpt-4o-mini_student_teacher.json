They included additional verses beyond the reference answer, demonstrating a deeper exploration of the topic. However, the student could have focused more on the specific verses mentioned in the reference answer to align closely with the concern provided. Overall, a well-thought-out response highlighting the significance of forgiveness in Christian practice."
