The verses chosen are key in highlighting the reciprocal nature of forgiveness, the importance of kindness, compassion, and patience, and the boundless extent to which believers are called to forgive. The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a clear and comprehensive explanation supported by scripture. Great job!"
