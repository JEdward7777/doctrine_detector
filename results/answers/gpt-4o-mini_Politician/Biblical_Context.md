## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the New Testament, the responsibilities of deacons are primarily outlined in the Book of Acts and the Epistles. The role of deacons is generally seen as one of service and support within the church community.

1. **Acts 6:1-6**: This passage describes the early church appointing seven individuals to assist with the distribution of food and resources, ensuring that both the Hebraic and Hellenistic widows were treated fairly. This marks the origin of the diaconate, emphasizing the role of deacons in serving practical needs within the congregation.

2. **1 Timothy 3:8-13**: The Apostle Paul provides qualifications for deacons, suggesting they should be dignified, not double-tongued, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. They are to hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience and be tested before serving. Paul also mentions the importance of family life, stating that deacons should be the husband of one wife and manage their children and households well. 

Overall, the New Testament emphasizes that deacons are called to serve, support the ministry of the church, and help maintain unity and care within the community. Their role is vital for the overall functioning and well-being of the church body.
