  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, citing relevant passages and discussing the role of deacons in serving practical needs within the church community. However, the answer does not focus specifically on the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as requested. While the student addresses the general service and support aspect of the deacons' role, the emphasis on fair distribution of resources to widows is not explicitly highlighted in the response. Therefore, the grade is slightly lower as the specific concern was not directly addressed."
