Additionally, the student provides a relevant excerpt from 1 Timothy 3:8-13, highlighting the qualifications and characteristics expected of deacons.\n\nWhile the response is comprehensive and well-written, it could benefit from further elaboration on the broader role of deacons in supporting and upholding the ministry of the church.
