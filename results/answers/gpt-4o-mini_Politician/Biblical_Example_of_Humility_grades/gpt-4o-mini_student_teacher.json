While Moses is indeed known for his humility, the teacher specifically asked for a biblical character that exemplified humility, and the reference answer was David. The student's response was thorough in discussing Moses' humility, but they missed the mark in addressing the specific concern raised by providing a different biblical character. The answer could have been improved by focusing on David's exemplary humility according to the reference answer provided."
