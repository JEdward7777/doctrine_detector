## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Certainly! One notable biblical figure who exemplifies humility is Moses. Throughout his life, Moses displayed profound humility, especially in his role as the leader of the Israelites. In Numbers 12:3, it is noted that Moses was “very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.” Despite being chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses often sought the counsel of others and interceded on behalf of the Israelites, showing his willingness to put the needs of the community above his own status. His humility and servant leadership serve as a powerful example for us all.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a well-articulated response highlighting Moses as an example of humility in the Bible. While Moses is indeed known for his humility, the teacher specifically asked for a biblical character that exemplified humility, and the reference answer was David. The student's response was thorough in discussing Moses' humility, but they missed the mark in addressing the specific concern raised by providing a different biblical character. The answer could have been improved by focusing on David's exemplary humility according to the reference answer provided.
