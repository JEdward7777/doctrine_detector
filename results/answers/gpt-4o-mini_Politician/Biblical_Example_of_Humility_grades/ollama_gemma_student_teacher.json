  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of humility as seen in the life of Moses. The reference to Numbers 12:3 effectively supports the claim that Moses was exceptionally humble. The inclusion of specific examples of Moses' humility, such as seeking counsel from others and interceding on behalf of the Israelites, strengthens the argument. The overall clarity and coherence of the response contribute to a high grade."
