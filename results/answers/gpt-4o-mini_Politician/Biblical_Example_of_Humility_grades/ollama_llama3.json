  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern by finding a tangible example of humility in the scriptures, specifically Moses, and uses biblical language to support its claim. The writer provides specific details from Numbers 12:3 about Moses' humility and offers examples of his servant leadership, which demonstrates a good understanding of what it means to be humble. Additionally, the response shows a clear connection between Moses' humility and his role as leader, highlighting how his humility was an essential aspect of his leadership.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not explicitly state how Moses' humility relates to the original answer about David being an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God. While it can be inferred that Moses' humility is an example of this, it would strengthen the response to make this connection more explicit.\n\nOverall, however, this response is well-organized, biblically grounded, and effectively addresses the concern, earning it a high grade."
