Can you provide a biblical example of a character who exemplified humility?

David is an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God.

Finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Certainly! One notable biblical figure who exemplifies humility is Moses. Throughout his life, Moses displayed profound humility, especially in his role as the leader of the Israelites. In Numbers 12:3, it is noted that Moses was “very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.” Despite being chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses often sought the counsel of others and interceded on behalf of the Israelites, showing his willingness to put the needs of the community above his own status. His humility and servant leadership serve as a powerful example for us all.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response effectively addresses the concern by finding a tangible example of humility in the scriptures, specifically Moses, and uses biblical language to support its claim. The writer provides specific details from Numbers 12:3 about Moses' humility and offers examples of his servant leadership, which demonstrates a good understanding of what it means to be humble. Additionally, the response shows a clear connection between Moses' humility and his role as leader, highlighting how his humility was an essential aspect of his leadership.

The only area for improvement is that the response does not explicitly state how Moses' humility relates to the original answer about David being an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God. While it can be inferred that Moses' humility is an example of this, it would strengthen the response to make this connection more explicit.

Overall, however, this response is well-organized, biblically grounded, and effectively addresses the concern, earning it a high grade.
