## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Certainly! One notable biblical figure who exemplifies humility is Moses. Throughout his life, Moses displayed profound humility, especially in his role as the leader of the Israelites. In Numbers 12:3, it is noted that Moses was “very humble, more than any man who was on the face of the earth.” Despite being chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and receiving the Ten Commandments, Moses often sought the counsel of others and interceded on behalf of the Israelites, showing his willingness to put the needs of the community above his own status. His humility and servant leadership serve as a powerful example for us all.
