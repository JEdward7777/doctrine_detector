After God created human beings, it is recorded that He blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it."

Comment: The student's response accurately references Genesis 1:28 as an example of God blessing creation, specifically humans, and highlights the responsibility of stewardship. The explanation provided is clear and connects the biblical passage to contemporary relevance. However, to improve, the student could have delved deeper into the theological significance of God's blessing in this context, emphasizing the overarching theme of God's sovereignty over creation and humanity's role in it. Additionally, the student could have integrated more scriptural references or theological insights to further strengthen the answer.
