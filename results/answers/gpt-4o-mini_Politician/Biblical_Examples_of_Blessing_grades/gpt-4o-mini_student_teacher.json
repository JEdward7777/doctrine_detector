  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of blessings in the Bible. However, the student provided an example that deviates from the reference answer given by the teacher. While the student's example from Genesis 1:28 is relevant and insightful, the question specifically asked for an example where God blesses creation, and the reference answer cites Genesis 1:22. The student effectively explained the significance of their chosen example, but a closer alignment with the provided reference would have been more appropriate."
