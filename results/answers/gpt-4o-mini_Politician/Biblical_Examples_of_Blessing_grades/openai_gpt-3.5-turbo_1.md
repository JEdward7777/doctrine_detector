Grade: 80 

Comment: The response provides a relevant example from the Bible that highlights God's blessing of creation and the responsibility of stewardship. However, there is a slight mismatch in the specific verse referenced, as the answer mentioned Genesis 1:22 instead of Genesis 1:28. Nonetheless, the response effectively communicates the concept of blessings in scripture and their implications for humanity's relationship with the environment.
