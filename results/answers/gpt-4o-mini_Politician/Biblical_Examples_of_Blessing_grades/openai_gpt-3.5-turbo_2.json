  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides a relevant biblical example from Genesis 1:22, the key concern was specific to illustrating how blessings are depicted in scripture. The response did not fully address this concern as it focused on a different verse that, while related, did not directly address the concept of blessings as outlined in the Bible. There is room for improvement in connecting the chosen verse to the concept of blessings to receive a higher grade."
