However, the explanation of God's blessing in Genesis 1:28 is well-articulated and effectively conveys the message of stewardship of the earth. The connection between blessings in scripture and the responsibility to care for creation is effectively explained, demonstrating a solid understanding of how blessings are illustrated in the Bible."
