## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Certainly! The concept of innocence, especially in the context of Jesus and his interactions with his accusers, can be observed in several passages from the Scriptures. Here are a few notable examples:

1. **John 8:7-11** - The story of the woman caught in adultery showcases Jesus' approach to innocence. When the Pharisees brought her before Him, they sought to trap Him with the law. Jesus responded, "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her." This passage highlights the idea of innocence, as it draws attention to the judgment of others and the true nature of sin. Ultimately, Jesus did not condemn the woman but encouraged her to "go, and from now on sin no more," thus affirming her dignity and potential for redemption.

2. **Luke 23:4** - During His trial before Pilate, Jesus was declared innocent by the governor. Pilate stated, “I find no guilt in this man.” This recognition of Jesus' innocence amidst false accusations illustrates not only the injustice He faced but also the integrity of His character.

3. **Matthew 27:3-4** - After Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Judas expressed remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver, saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” This acknowledgment of Jesus' innocence underlines the significance of His identity and mission.

4. **Isaiah 53:7** - This prophetic passage refers to the suffering servant, which Christians understand as a foreshadowing of Jesus. It states, "He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter." This imagery conveys the innocence and submission of Jesus in the face of unjust accusations and suffering.

5. **1 Peter 2:22** - The apostle Peter writes about Jesus, "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth." This reinforces the idea of Jesus' complete innocence, both in His actions and His words, contrasting with the wrongful accusations made against Him.

These examples collectively illustrate a profound narrative of innocence in the face of injustice, showcasing the character and mission of Jesus while providing a poignant commentary on human judgment and the nature of sin.
