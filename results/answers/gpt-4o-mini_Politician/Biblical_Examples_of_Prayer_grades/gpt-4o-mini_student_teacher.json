  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful response, offering multiple examples from the Bible that highlight the power and importance of prayer. The examples chosen effectively illustrate different aspects of prayer and its significance in various contexts. However, the student deviated from the teacher's specific reference answer, which contained more direct examples and could have been incorporated into the response for a more complete answer."
