  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided comprehensive examples from the Bible that effectively demonstrate the act of repentance and its practical application. However, the student's answer was more detailed and included a wider range of examples compared to the reference answer from the teacher. The additional examples provided by the student enrich the understanding of repentance as seen through various biblical narratives."
