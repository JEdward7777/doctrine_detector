The concept of transgression, which often refers to the act of violating a command, law, or moral code, is addressed in several biblical references. Here are a few key examples:

1. **Genesis 2:16-17**: This passage describes God's command to Adam regarding the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The transgression occurs when Adam and Eve eat from the forbidden tree, which is often seen as the original sin.

2. **Exodus 20**: The Ten Commandments outline various commandments that, when broken, represent transgressions against God's law. For example, violating the commandment to not steal or bear false witness signifies a breach of moral conduct.

3. **Psalm 51:1-3**: In this psalm, King David acknowledges his transgressions and seeks forgiveness, illustrating an understanding of the weight of sins and the need for repentance.

4. **Romans 3:23**: This New Testament verse states, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." It emphasizes the universal nature of transgression and the need for grace.

5. **James 4:17**: This verse points out that knowing the right thing to do and failing to do it is also considered a transgression, expanding the understanding of what it means to act against moral duty.

These references collectively highlight the importance of understanding moral boundaries and the implications of actions that fall short of those guidelines. They serve as meaningful reflections on the human experience regarding ethics, accountability, and the pursuit of forgiveness.
