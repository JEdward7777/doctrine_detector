  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid foundation on the concept of transgression in the Bible with appropriate references. However, the answer could be improved by incorporating additional references like 1 Thessalonians 4:6, Daniel 9:24-25, and Psalm 32:1, as stated in the teacher's reference answer. By including these additional references, the student's answer could have been more comprehensive and aligned with the specific concern of learning from biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls."
