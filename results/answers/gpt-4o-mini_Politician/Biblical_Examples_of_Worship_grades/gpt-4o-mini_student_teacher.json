  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer by citing both the Old and New Testaments to showcase the contrast between true worship of God and idol worship. They demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of avoiding idolatry in worship. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher offers a more concise and specific example directly addressing the question, hence the slight deduction in the grade."
