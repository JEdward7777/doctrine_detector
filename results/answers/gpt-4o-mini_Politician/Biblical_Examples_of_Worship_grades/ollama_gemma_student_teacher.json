  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that clearly articulates the negative contrast between true worship and idol worship in the Bible. The student provides a solid example from Exodus 20:1-6 and reinforces it with a reference from the New Testament. The language is clear and concise, demonstrating a deep understanding of the subject matter from a Christian perspective."
