## Question [Biblical Examples of Worship](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md)
Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

## Correct Answer
One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Stated Concern
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Certainly! One notable example can be found in the Book of Exodus, particularly in Exodus 20:1-6, which contains the Ten Commandments. In this passage, God explicitly instructs the Israelites to have no other gods besides Him and to refrain from making or worshiping idols. 

The negative contrast here is clear: true worship involves devotion to God alone, while idol worship denotes placing faith or reverence in created objects or beings. This distinction emphasizes the importance of authentic worship that honors the divine, reflecting a commitment that is free from distractions or misdirections toward earthly representations.

Furthermore, in the New Testament, 1 John 5:21 advises followers to "keep yourselves from idols," reinforcing the idea that genuine worship is a matter of heart and intention, focused solely on the divine rather than created things. This contrast serves as a reminder of the values of true devotion and the potential pitfalls of idolization.
