Jesus directed his apostles to spread the good news of the Gospel, emphasizing the importance of sharing messages of love, compassion, and hope. He instructed them to go forth and make disciples of all nations, teaching and baptizing them. This directive is often summarized in the Great Commission, found in the Gospel of Matthew 28:19-20.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student's response provides a general overview of the directive Jesus gave to his apostles regarding spreading the Gospel. They correctly mention the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20 and emphasize the importance of sharing messages of love and compassion. However, the response lacks specificity and depth in explaining the full scope of the Great Commission, which includes not just teaching and baptizing, but also obedience to all that Jesus commanded. Additionally, the response could benefit from mentioning repentance and faith in Christ as essential components of the Gospel message. Overall, there is room for improvement in providing a more comprehensive and doctrinally precise explanation of Jesus' directive to his apostles.
