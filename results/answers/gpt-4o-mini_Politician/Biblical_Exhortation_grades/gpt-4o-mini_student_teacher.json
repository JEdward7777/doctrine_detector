They have accurately referenced the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20 and highlighted the inclusivity and outreach aspect of spreading the Gospel. However, there is a minor deviation in the specific directive Jesus gave to his apostles regarding the good news, as the teacher's reference answer emphasizes trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin."
