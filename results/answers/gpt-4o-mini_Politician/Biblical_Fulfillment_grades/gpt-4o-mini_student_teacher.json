  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured response that demonstrates a strong understanding of how the references to Jesus as \"King of the Jews\" in the Bible reflect Old Testament prophecies. They have effectively highlighted specific prophecies related to the Messiah's lineage from David, attributes from Isaiah's vision, the concept of Zion's King, and the fulfillment in the New Testament. The student's explanation shows a depth of comprehension and connection between the Old Testament prophecies and their fulfillment in Jesus as the King of the Jews. The grade is slightly below perfect as the student could have connected their points more explicitly to the teacher's reference answer to demonstrate an even clearer alignment with Christian theological understanding."
