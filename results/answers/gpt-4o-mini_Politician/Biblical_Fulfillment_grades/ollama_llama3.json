  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response not only acknowledges the importance of recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment, but also provides specific examples from both the Old Testament (Davidic lineage, Isaiah's vision, Zion's king) and the New Testament (Jesus' life and mission) to demonstrate how Jesus' title \"King of the Jews\" is rooted in prophetic fulfillment. The response also thoughtfully considers the broader implications of Jesus' kingship, highlighting themes such as justice and divine authority.\n\nThe only aspect that prevents this response from being a perfect score is that it could be further developed to explicitly state the significance of recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment for Christian theology. While this is implicitly acknowledged through the examples provided, a more explicit connection between the two would strengthen the response's overall argument."
