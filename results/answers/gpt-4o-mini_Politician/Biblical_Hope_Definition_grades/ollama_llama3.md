In a biblical context, "hope" signifies a profound sense of expectation and trust in God's promises, reflecting both a present faith and future assurance. It is not merely a wish or desire, but a confident belief that God will fulfill His word. This hope is often rooted in the teachings and life of Jesus, where it extends beyond earthly circumstances to encompass eternal life and salvation.

Verses such as Romans 15:13 convey this by expressing that hope is a gift of the Holy Spirit, leading to joy and peace. Overall, in the biblical narrative, hope embodies a deep-seated trust in God's goodness and faithfulness, providing assurance that He is working for the ultimate good of His creation.
