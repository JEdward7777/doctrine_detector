It expands on the initial answer by emphasizing that hope in the Bible is not merely a wish but a confident belief rooted in God's promises and faithfulness. The inclusion of relevant biblical references and the acknowledgement of hope as a gift of the Holy Spirit further strengthen the theological understanding of hope in a Christian worldview."
