  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student provided an excellent selection of Bible verses that effectively illustrate the concept of God's majesty, demonstrating an understanding of the grandeur, power, and holiness associated with God. However, the student missed out on some key references that the teacher included, such as 2 Peter 1:16-18, Daniel 4:36, Isaiah 2:10, Jude 1:25, and Micah 5:4. Encouraging the student to include these additional verses would have enriched their answer and provided a more comprehensive understanding of God's majestic nature."
