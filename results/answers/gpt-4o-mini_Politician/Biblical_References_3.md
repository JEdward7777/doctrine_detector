## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The concept of the "Son of Man" as a Messianic figure is notably rooted in several passages of the Old Testament, contributing significantly to the understanding of this title within a messianic context. Here are a few key references:

1. **Daniel 7:13-14**: This passage depicts a vision of “one like a son of man” coming with the clouds of heaven, who is given authority, glory, and a kingdom. This vision is central to understanding the "Son of Man" in a messianic context, emphasizing divine authority and eternal kingship.

2. **Psalm 8:4-6**: This psalm reflects on human dignity and the role of humanity in creation, referring to “a son of man” in a way that points to humanity’s significant position. This can be interpreted to relate to the Messiah’s role as a representative of humanity.

3. **Ezekiel 2:1-3**: The term "Son of Man" is used frequently in Ezekiel to refer to the prophet himself but carries connotations that can also be applied to the expectation of a singular, ideal representative figure who would embody the hopes of Israel.

4. **Isaiah 53**: While the term “Son of Man” isn't explicitly used here, this chapter, which describes the suffering servant, is often linked to messianic expectations and provides depth to the understanding of the nature of the Messiah as one who would suffer and bring redemption.

These references collectively contribute to the theological framework that sees the "Son of Man" as both a representative of humanity and a figure of divine appointment, embodying the hopes of deliverance and restoration for God's people. Engaging with these texts fosters a deeper appreciation for the nuanced interpretations within the faith that has emerged over centuries.
