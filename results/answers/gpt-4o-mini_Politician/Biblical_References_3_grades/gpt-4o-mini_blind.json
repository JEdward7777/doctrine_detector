  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer to the question, citing relevant Old Testament passages that contribute to the understanding of the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah. The explanations given for each reference are clear and demonstrate a good grasp of the theological significance of these passages in relation to the messianic concept. The only recommendation for improvement would be to explicitly highlight the Christological interpretation of the \"Son of Man\" title in the context of the New Testament and its connection to Jesus Christ."
