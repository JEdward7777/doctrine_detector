  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the Old Testament references contributing to the understanding of the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah. The inclusion of relevant passages and explanations showcases a depth of knowledge and critical thinking in connecting these texts to Jesus' messianic role. However, while the student covered a range of pertinent Old Testament references, the response could have been strengthened by focusing more on the specific passages highlighted in the provided reference answer."
