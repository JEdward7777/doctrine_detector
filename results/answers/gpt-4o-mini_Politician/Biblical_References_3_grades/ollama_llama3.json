  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides some relevant Old Testament references that are related to the concept of the \"Son of Man\" and its messianic implications, specifically mentioning Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel. However, the connection between these references and Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\" in the New Testament is not explicitly explored or developed.\n\nThe concern was to explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\" While the response touches on some relevant Old Testament texts, it does not fully address this concern. To receive a higher score, the response could have more thoroughly analyzed and applied these Old Testament references to Jesus' messianic role in the New Testament.\n\nComment: The response shows a good understanding of some key Old Testament passages related to the \"Son of Man\" concept, but falls short in fully exploring how these texts inform our understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\""
