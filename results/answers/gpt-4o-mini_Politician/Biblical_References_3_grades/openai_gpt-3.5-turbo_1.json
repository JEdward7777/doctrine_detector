By referencing passages from Daniel, Ezekiel, Psalms, and Isaiah, it effectively demonstrates the theological framework surrounding this title. It acknowledges the connection between the Old Testament and the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man,' highlighting the prophetic identity and divine appointment associated with this title. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into how these Old Testament concepts specifically influenced the New Testament portrayal of Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of Messianic expectations."
