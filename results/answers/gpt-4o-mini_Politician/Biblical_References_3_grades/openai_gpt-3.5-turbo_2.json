The provided references from Daniel, Psalm, Ezekiel, and Isaiah effectively demonstrate the connections between the title \"Son of Man\" and the expectations surrounding the Messiah in Jewish thought. The integration of Old Testament prophecies with the New Testament portrayal of Jesus as the fulfillment of Messianic hopes is well articulated and aligns with a Christian worldview perspective."
