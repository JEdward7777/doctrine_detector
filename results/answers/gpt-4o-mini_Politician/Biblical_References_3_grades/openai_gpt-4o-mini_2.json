It acknowledges the prophetic identity associated with the title. However, to further strengthen the argument, more explicit connections between these Old Testament references and the portrayal of Jesus as the 'Son of Man' in the New Testament could be included, enhancing the exploration of how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding."
