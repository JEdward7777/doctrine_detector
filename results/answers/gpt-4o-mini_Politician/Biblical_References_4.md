Certainly! The term "Lord" is frequently used in the Bible to refer to God, conveying authority, reverence, and divinity. Here are a few examples of biblical passages that illustrate this usage:

1. **Psalm 23:1** - "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." This passage emphasizes the protective and guiding nature of God.

2. **Isaiah 40:28** - "Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth." This highlights God's eternal nature and creative power.

3. **Exodus 20:2** - "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." Here, God introduces Himself with authority and a reminder of His role in liberation.

4. **Philippians 2:11** - "And every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." This underscores the recognition of Jesus' divine authority.

5. **Psalm 100:3** - "Know that the Lord, He is God; It is He who has made us, and we are His." This passage reiterates God's role as Creator and our relationship with Him.

These examples illustrate the reverence and significance attributed to "Lord" in relation to God throughout the biblical text.
