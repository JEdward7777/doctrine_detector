  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and informative response with relevant biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God. The examples chosen effectively convey the authority and divinity of God. However, the student could have included a broader range of biblical passages as suggested in the reference answer to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concept."
