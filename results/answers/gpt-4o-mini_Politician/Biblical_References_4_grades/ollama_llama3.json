  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides more biblical examples to illustrate the usage of \"Lord\" in reference to God, which aligns with the concern of recognizing biblical references to reinforce understanding of God's authority. However, while the provided examples are accurate and relevant, they could be further contextualized and analyzed to demonstrate a deeper understanding of God's character and nature as Lord. The response could also benefit from more explicit connections between the biblical passages and the concern of acknowledging God's authority as Lord. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good grasp of biblical references and their significance in relation to God's authority."
