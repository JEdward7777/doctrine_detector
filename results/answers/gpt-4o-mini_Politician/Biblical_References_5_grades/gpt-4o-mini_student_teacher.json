  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80. The student provided two relevant biblical passages that connect the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings, demonstrating an understanding of the topic. However, the student could have been more concise and focused in their explanation, as the response included some unnecessary background information and was slightly off in the interpretation of Luke 22:19-20. Overall, a solid effort but could benefit from more clarity and precision."
