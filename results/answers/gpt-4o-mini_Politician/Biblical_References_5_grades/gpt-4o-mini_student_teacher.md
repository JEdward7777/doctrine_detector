## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of unleavened bread is prominently connected to teachings about the Last Supper. One key scripture that highlights this connection is found in Luke 22:19-20, where Jesus takes bread, gives thanks, breaks it, and gives it to His disciples, stating, "This is my body, which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me." While this passage doesn't explicitly mention unleavened bread, it takes place during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is a significant aspect of Jewish tradition linked to the Passover. 

Additionally, in 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, Paul refers to unleavened bread in the context of a call for purity among believers: "Clean out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."

These passages reflect how the symbolism of unleavened bread is used in Christian teachings to represent Christ's sacrifice and the call to live a life of purity and integrity.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 80. The student provided two relevant biblical passages that connect the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings, demonstrating an understanding of the topic. However, the student could have been more concise and focused in their explanation, as the response included some unnecessary background information and was slightly off in the interpretation of Luke 22:19-20. Overall, a solid effort but could benefit from more clarity and precision.
