  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response excels in focusing on scripture, as the concern requires. The provided verses are not only relevant but also carefully selected to highlight the significance of resurrection within the Christian faith. The writer has taken the time to provide six specific passages from both the Old and New Testaments, demonstrating a good understanding of the theme across different parts of the Bible.\n\nWhile it would be ideal for the response to provide more context or explanation about each verse, as well as potential connections between them, the sheer number of relevant scriptures provided is impressive. The only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that there's no explicit discussion of how these verses relate to each other or to the original answer.\n\nThe writer does a great job of showcasing their understanding of resurrection through Scripture, but could benefit from further development and analysis to make their response truly exceptional."
