The concept of resurrection is a significant theme in the Bible and can be found in several verses across both the Old and New Testaments. Here are some key scriptures that offer insight into this important belief:

1. **Job 19:25-26** - "For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth, and after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God."

2. **Isaiah 26:19** - "Your dead shall live; their bodies shall rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and sing for joy!"

3. **Matthew 28:5-6** - "But the angel said to the women, 'Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.'"

4. **John 11:25-26** - "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.'"

5. **1 Corinthians 15:20-22** - "But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead."

6. **Revelation 20:12-13** - "And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done."

These verses highlight the hope and promise of resurrection, signifying both spiritual and physical renewal and the assurance of life after death. Each passage contributes to a deeper understanding of the significance of resurrection within the Christian faith.
