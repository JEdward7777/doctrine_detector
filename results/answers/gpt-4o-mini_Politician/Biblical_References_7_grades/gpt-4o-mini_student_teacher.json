  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of Bible references highlighting the significance of the Sabbath, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. The references chosen effectively support the importance of the Sabbath in terms of rest, worship, and spiritual renewal. However, the student could have included the specific command to observe the Sabbath and its purpose as outlined in the teacher's reference answer for a more focused response. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the Sabbath's significance in Christian faith."
