1. **Exodus 20:8-11** - This passage is part of the Ten Commandments, where it instructs followers to remember the Sabbath day, keeping it holy, and reflecting on God's creation and rest.

2. **Genesis 2:2-3** - Here, it is noted that God rested on the seventh day after creation, blessing it and making it holy. This passage establishes the foundational importance of rest.

3. **Isaiah 58:13-14** - This scripture emphasizes the Sabbath as a day of delight, encouraging people to honor it by not pursuing their own interests and finding joy in the Lord.

4. **Mark 2:27** - Jesus teaches that the Sabbath was made for humanityâ€™s benefit, indicating its purpose is to serve and nurture human well-being.

5. **Hebrews 4:9-10** - This New Testament passage speaks of a Sabbath rest that remains for the people of God, highlighting the spiritual significance of rest and renewal.

These references encourage a thoughtful understanding of the Sabbath's role as a time for rest, reflection, and spiritual rejuvenation.
