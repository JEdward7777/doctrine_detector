## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The concept of ransom in the Bible often highlights themes of liberation and redemption. Here are a few key verses that reference ransom and contribute to the understanding of redemption:

1. **Matthew 20:28** - "Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."  
   This verse emphasizes the sacrificial nature of Jesus' mission, portraying the idea that His life was given as a price to free others from sin and death, thus illustrating the profound concept of redemption.

2. **Mark 10:45** - "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."  
   Similar to Matthew, this verse reiterates Jesus’ purpose and highlights His role in redeeming humanity, reinforcing the idea that His sacrifice has a redemptive quality.

3. **1 Timothy 2:5-6** - "For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people."  
   These verses present Jesus as a mediator, and His role as a ransom emphasizes the universal offer of redemption available to all individuals, creating a sense of inclusivity in the message.

4. **Psalm 49:7-8** - "No one can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for them—the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough."  
   This Old Testament passage reflects the idea that human efforts alone cannot secure redemption, underscoring the necessity of divine intervention, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ.

5. **Isaiah 53:5** - "But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds, we are healed."  
   Often interpreted as a prophetic reference to Jesus, this verse contributes to the understanding of redemption by illustrating the deep connection between suffering, sacrifice, and the restoration of peace and wholeness.

These verses collectively deepen our understanding of ransom and redemption by illustrating themes of sacrifice, mediation, and divine love, while emphasizing the inclusive nature of God's offer to humanity. They invite contemplation on the significance of faith, service, and the transformative power of redemption.
