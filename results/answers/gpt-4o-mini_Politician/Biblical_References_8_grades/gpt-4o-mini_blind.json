The explanations were clear and demonstrated a good understanding of the theological significance of each verse in relation to Jesus' sacrificial work for humanity's redemption. The only minor improvement could be further elaboration on the link between ransom and redemption in each specific verse. Overall, an excellent response that showcases a strong grasp of the topic. Well done!"
