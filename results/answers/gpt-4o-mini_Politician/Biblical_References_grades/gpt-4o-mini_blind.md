2. **Exodus 34:6-7** - "And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, 'The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion, and sin.'"

3. **Psalm 89:1-2** - "I will sing of the Lord’s great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations. I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you established your faithfulness in heaven itself."

4. **Lamentations 3:22-23** - "Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness."

5. **Hebrews 10:23** - "Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful."
