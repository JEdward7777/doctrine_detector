  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response effectively provides additional scriptural references, Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18, which contribute to the understanding of covenant faithfulness in the Bible. The student correctly connects these verses to the concept of covenant faithfulness, adding value to the discussion on this theme. However, the response could have been improved by further elaborating on how these specific verses highlight God's faithfulness to His covenant and how they relate to the broader theme presented in the original response."
