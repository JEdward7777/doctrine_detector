  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical passages and their significance in relation to the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. The student clearly articulates the radical shift in salvation from a Jewish-centered focus to a universal offer of grace through faith in Jesus Christ. The connection between Galatians 2:16 and the rejection of legalistic requirements for justification is also well-explained. The overall coherence, clarity, and depth of the response justify a high grade."
