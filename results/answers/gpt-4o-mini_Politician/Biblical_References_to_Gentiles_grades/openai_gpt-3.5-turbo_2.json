  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion, referencing Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 to support the discussion. It emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus for Gentiles' justification and highlights the early church's shift towards a more inclusive understanding of salvation. The analysis is thorough and aligns well with Christian teachings on grace and inclusion. Well done!"
