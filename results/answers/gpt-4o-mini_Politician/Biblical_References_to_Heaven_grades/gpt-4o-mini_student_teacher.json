  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 85. \n\nThe student has provided an insightful and well-structured response, citing relevant Bible verses that offer different perspectives on the concept of heaven. The verses chosen by the student effectively highlight key themes such as preparation, reunion, freedom from suffering, spiritual citizenship, rewards, and the promise of a renewed creation. The student also acknowledges the significance of these verses in various religious and spiritual contexts. However, the concern specifically mentioned different verses as key, which were not entirely covered by the student. This discrepancy is why the grade is slightly lower. Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and effectively communicated their insights."
