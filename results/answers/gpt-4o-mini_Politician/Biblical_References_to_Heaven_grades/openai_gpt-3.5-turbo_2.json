However, the response did not directly address the concern about exploring the references to enhance understanding of God's kingdom and the physical and spiritual realities of heaven. Would have been strengthened by connecting the verses to the broader concept of God's kingdom and discussing how they shed light on the physical and spiritual aspects of heaven in relation to God's kingdom."
