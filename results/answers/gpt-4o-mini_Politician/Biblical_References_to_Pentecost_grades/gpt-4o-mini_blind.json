  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 95. The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate list of the books of the Bible that reference the Festival of Weeks/Shavuot, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament. They have accurately highlighted the key passages and themes associated with the festival, including its agricultural significance, instructions for observance, and its spiritual significance in Christian tradition with the events of Pentecost in the book of Acts. The only room for improvement would be to elaborate a bit more on the significance of Pentecost in relation to the Festival of Weeks."
