  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the references to the Festival of Weeks in Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Acts, demonstrating a solid understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. However, the teacher's reference answer includes additional books where references to the Festival of Weeks can be found, which the student did not cover. The student's response was accurate and well-written, but to achieve a higher grade, they should have included all the books listed in the teacher's reference."
