The Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot in Jewish tradition, is primarily referenced in the following books of the Bible:

1. **Exodus**: In Exodus 34:22, the Festival of Weeks is mentioned as one of the three major pilgrimage festivals during which the people were to present offerings to God.

2. **Leviticus**: Leviticus 23:15-22 provides specific instructions on how to observe the Festival of Weeks, detailing the counting of the Omer and the offerings that should be made during the celebration.

3. **Deuteronomy**: In Deuteronomy 16:9-12, there are further instructions regarding the celebration of this festival, emphasizing the importance of it as a time of thanksgiving for the harvest and remembrance of the Israelites' liberation from Egypt.

4. **Acts**: In the New Testament, Acts 2 describes the events of Pentecost, which occurs 50 days after Passover and is linked to the Festival of Weeks. It details the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples, marking a significant moment in Christian tradition.

These passages reflect the festival's agricultural significance as well as its broader themes of gratitude and community celebration.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the references to the Festival of Weeks in Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Acts, demonstrating a solid understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. However, the teacher's reference answer includes additional books where references to the Festival of Weeks can be found, which the student did not cover. The student's response was accurate and well-written, but to achieve a higher grade, they should have included all the books listed in the teacher's reference.
