The provided answer mentions only Deuteronomy and Acts, whereas the correct answer includes Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Acts. Additionally, the concern about understanding the scriptural basis for Pentecost is partially addressed, as the response notes the connection between Pentecost (Acts 2) and the Festival of Weeks. However, a more comprehensive treatment of the biblical passages related to this festival would be necessary to fully address the concern.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide accurate and detailed references to the relevant biblical passages that discuss the Festival of Weeks, as well as a clearer explanation of its significance in Christian tradition."
