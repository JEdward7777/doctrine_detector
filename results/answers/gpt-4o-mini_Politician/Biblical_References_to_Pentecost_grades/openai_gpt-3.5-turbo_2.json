  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides accurate references to key biblical books that mention the Festival of Weeks and its significance, including Acts which connects it to Pentecost. However, it does not mention 2 Chronicles or Numbers as suggested in the provided answer. The response effectively explains the agricultural and communal aspects of the festival but could strengthen the connection to the scriptural basis for the observance of Pentecost."
