## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot in Jewish tradition, is primarily referenced in the following books of the Bible:

1. **Exodus**: In Exodus 34:22, the Festival of Weeks is mentioned as one of the three major pilgrimage festivals during which the people were to present offerings to God.

2. **Leviticus**: Leviticus 23:15-22 provides specific instructions on how to observe the Festival of Weeks, detailing the counting of the Omer and the offerings that should be made during the celebration.

3. **Deuteronomy**: In Deuteronomy 16:9-12, there are further instructions regarding the celebration of this festival, emphasizing the importance of it as a time of thanksgiving for the harvest and remembrance of the Israelites' liberation from Egypt.

4. **Acts**: In the New Testament, Acts 2 describes the events of Pentecost, which occurs 50 days after Passover and is linked to the Festival of Weeks. It details the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples, marking a significant moment in Christian tradition.

These passages reflect the festival's agricultural significance as well as its broader themes of gratitude and community celebration.

Comment: While the response provides accurate references to the Festival of Weeks (Shavuot) in the Old Testament books of Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Acts, it does not mention 2 Chronicles or Numbers as stated in the given answer. However, the explanation of the festival's observance and significance is clear and demonstrates a foundational understanding of the scriptural basis for Pentecost. The connections between the Old Testament celebrations and the events of Pentecost in Acts are well-articulated.
