  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of the references to the Festival of Weeks in the Bible, detailing specific passages from Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Acts. However, the initial answer mentioned additional books (2 Chronicles and Numbers) where the Festival of Weeks is referenced, which was not addressed in the response. The scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost was discussed in relation to Acts, highlighting the connection between Pentecost and the Festival of Weeks. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural basis for Pentecost but could have provided more clarity on all the referenced books mentioned in the initial statement."
