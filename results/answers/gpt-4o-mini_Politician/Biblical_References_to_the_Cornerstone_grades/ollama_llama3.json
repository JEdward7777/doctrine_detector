  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 90.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone, citing various Bible verses to support its argument. The inclusion of multiple verses from different books (Psalm, Matthew, Acts, Ephesians, and Peter) demonstrates a solid understanding of scripture and shows that the responder has taken the time to thoroughly research and consider different perspectives.\n\nThe response also effectively conveys the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone, highlighting His role in establishing faith and the Church. The use of language such as \"strength,\" \"stability,\" and \"divine purpose\" emphasizes the importance of Jesus' foundation for believers.\n\nOne area where the response could improve is in providing more explicit connections between the verses cited and the concern about encouraging believers to explore scripture. While the response does demonstrate a good understanding of scripture, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the scriptural references and the idea that exploring scripture deepens one's understanding of Jesus' significance.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides a solid foundation for further exploration and reflection on the role of Jesus as the cornerstone."
