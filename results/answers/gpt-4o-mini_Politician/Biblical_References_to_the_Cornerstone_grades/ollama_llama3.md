## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Cornerstone.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The concept of Jesus as the cornerstone is present in several Bible verses, which convey His foundational role in faith and the Church. Here are a few key verses:

1. **Psalm 118:22-23** - "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is the Lord's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes." 
   - This verse highlights the notion that Jesus, though rejected by some, is established by God as a vital part of the faith.

2. **Matthew 21:42** - "Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this is what the Lord has done, and it is marvelous in our eyes?'"
   - Here, Jesus directly quotes Psalm 118, emphasizing His role and the divine plan behind His mission.

3. **Acts 4:11** - "Jesus is 'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.'"
   - This verse reaffirms that Jesus’s rejection by some was part of His destiny to be the cornerstone of salvation.

4. **Ephesians 2:19-20** - "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone."
   - This passage emphasizes the importance of Jesus as the foundational figure of the Church and the faith community.

5. **1 Peter 2:6** - "For in Scripture it says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.'"
   - Peter references Jesus as the precious cornerstone, indicating that faith in Him secures one's place in God’s plan.

These verses collectively convey the message that Jesus serves as the essential foundation for believers, symbolizing strength, stability, and a divine purpose in the establishment of faith. He is recognized as integral to the identity and unity of the Church and offers security and assurance to those who place their trust in Him.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 90.

The response provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone, citing various Bible verses to support its argument. The inclusion of multiple verses from different books (Psalm, Matthew, Acts, Ephesians, and Peter) demonstrates a solid understanding of scripture and shows that the responder has taken the time to thoroughly research and consider different perspectives.

The response also effectively conveys the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone, highlighting His role in establishing faith and the Church. The use of language such as "strength," "stability," and "divine purpose" emphasizes the importance of Jesus' foundation for believers.

One area where the response could improve is in providing more explicit connections between the verses cited and the concern about encouraging believers to explore scripture. While the response does demonstrate a good understanding of scripture, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the scriptural references and the idea that exploring scripture deepens one's understanding of Jesus' significance.

Overall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides a solid foundation for further exploration and reflection on the role of Jesus as the cornerstone.
