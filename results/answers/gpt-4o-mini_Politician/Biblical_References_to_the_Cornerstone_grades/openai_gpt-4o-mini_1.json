It provides a comprehensive overview of how these verses collectively highlight Jesus' essential role and significance. The analysis aligns well with the concern of encouraging believers to deepen their understanding of Jesus through scripture exploration. The response could be further strengthened by elaborating on how believers can practically apply this understanding of Jesus as the cornerstone in their daily lives and faith walk. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
