  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides some relevant scripture references that mention the term \"house of Yahweh\" or the temple as God's house. However, it does not provide as much context and explanation as I would like to see for each reference. Additionally, the response only lists five scriptures, whereas the concern asks for identification of key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house.\n\nThe provided answer, on the other hand, is very brief and lacks specificity. It mentions 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4 as references to the \"house of Yahweh\", but does not provide any further explanation or context.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest providing more scripture references that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house, as well as offering some analysis or interpretation of what these scriptures say about the relationship between God and His people through the temple."
