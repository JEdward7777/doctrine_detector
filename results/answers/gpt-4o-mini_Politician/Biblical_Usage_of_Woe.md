## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Certainly! The term "woe" appears several times in the Bible, often conveying a sense of lament or a warning of impending judgment. Here are a few examples and their implications regarding God’s judgment:

1. **Matthew 23:13** - In this passage, Jesus says, "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!" This illustrates God's judgment on religious leaders who fail to practice what they preach. It emphasizes the importance of authenticity and integrity in spiritual leadership.

2. **Isaiah 5:8** - The prophet Isaiah declares, "Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field." This reflects God's judgment against greed and the exploitation of others, highlighting the moral implications of unjust practices and the consequences they bring, both socially and spiritually.

3. **Luke 6:24** - Jesus states, "But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort." This warning addresses materialism and its potential to lead one away from spiritual truths. It serves as a call to reflect on the true sources of comfort and fulfillment in life.

4. **Revelation 18:10** - The phrase "Woe, woe, O great city," refers to the fall of Babylon, symbolizing divine judgment against corruption, immorality, and idolatry. This underscores the idea that systems or societies that turn away from God's ways will face consequences.

These examples collectively illustrate that the use of "woe" in the Bible serves as both a lament and a warning. They reveal that God's judgment often addresses issues of hypocrisy, injustice, materialism, and moral decay. Such warnings encourage self-examination, repentance, and alignment with God’s values, highlighting His desire for justice, authenticity, and righteousness.
