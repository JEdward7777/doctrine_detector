  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of the use of the term \"woe\" in the Bible and its implications regarding God's judgment. The student effectively references various Bible verses to support their points and connects them to broader themes of hypocrisy, injustice, materialism, and moral decay. The response could be strengthened by offering a more explicit connection to the larger biblical narrative of God's redemptive plan and the ultimate hope found in Christ. Additionally, highlighting the importance of repentance and turning back to God in response to His judgment would enhance the theological depth of the answer. Overall, a thorough and insightful analysis."
