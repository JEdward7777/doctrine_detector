  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive analysis of the use of \"woe\" in the Bible, connecting its implications to God's judgment on various aspects of human behavior. The examples cited effectively demonstrate how \"woe\" signifies severe judgment in response to sin and moral failings. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. Some additional examples could have further enriched the discussion, but overall, the analysis is thorough and reflective of a Christian worldview."
