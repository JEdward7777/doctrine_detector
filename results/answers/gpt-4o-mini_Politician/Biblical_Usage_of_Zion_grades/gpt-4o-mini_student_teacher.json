  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive understanding of the figurative ways in which the term 'Zion' is used in the Bible. They have effectively explored the deeper spiritual implications and symbolic meanings within Christian theology. The student's interpretations align well with the reference answer from the teacher, showcasing a solid grasp of the topic. However, to achieve a higher grade, the student could have delved further into the theological significance of 'Zion' in relation to themes such as redemption, salvation, and God's ultimate plan for His people."
