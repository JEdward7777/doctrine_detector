## [Answer](../Building_Materials.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
During biblical times, altars were commonly constructed using a variety of materials. The most frequently referenced materials include:

1. **Stones:** Many altars were built from uncut stones, as detailed in several passages of the Bible. These naturally occurring stones symbolized purity and were often stacked to create altars.

2. **Earth or Soil:** In some instances, altars were simply made from earth, as mentioned in the scriptures, which reflected a return to the natural state of the land.

3. **Wood:** Wooden altars were also used, particularly in temporary or mobile worship settings, such as during the Israelites' travels in the desert.

4. **Metal:** In later periods, particularly for more permanent structures, altars could also be made of metal, often covered with gold or bronze, especially in the context of the Temple in Jerusalem.

These materials were chosen for their availability and the symbolic meanings they carried within the context of worship and sacrifice in ancient cultures. Each material was imbued with spiritual significance and represented a connection to the divine.
