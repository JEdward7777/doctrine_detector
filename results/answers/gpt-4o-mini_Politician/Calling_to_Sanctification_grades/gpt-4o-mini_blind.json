However, the response could have been more specific in addressing the command given to believers regarding personal sanctification, such as quoting relevant scriptures like 1 Thessalonians 4:3 which states, \"For this is the will of God, your sanctification.\" Additionally, emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in the process of sanctification would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
