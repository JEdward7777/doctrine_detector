  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response that acknowledges the diverse beliefs and practices within different faith traditions regarding personal sanctification. However, the answer falls short of the specific command given to believers in the Christian faith, which is to sanctify themselves to God and be holy in everything they do. The emphasis on personal responsibility in the sanctification process within Christianity is not clearly highlighted in the student's answer."
