  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge the importance of personal responsibility in sanctification, it falls short in its emphasis on individual effort and neglects to highlight God's role in the process. The initial statement \"In many faith traditions, believers are often encouraged to pursue personal sanctification...\" sets a tone that prioritizes human effort over divine involvement. Additionally, the focus on personal growth and self-reflection, while important, may not sufficiently convey the transformative power of God's Spirit.\n\nThe response does make some positive connections to Christian scripture and practices, but could benefit from a more explicit recognition of God's agency in sanctification. To strengthen this response, it would be helpful to emphasize the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for holiness and the importance of seeking God's guidance throughout the process.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates some understanding of the concept of sanctification, but could benefit from a more balanced approach that highlights both personal responsibility and God's involvement."
