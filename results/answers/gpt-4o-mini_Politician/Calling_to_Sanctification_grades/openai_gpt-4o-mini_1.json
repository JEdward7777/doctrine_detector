However, it could have further emphasized personal responsibility in the sanctification process by explicitly stating the need for individual effort and cooperation with the work of the Holy Spirit. By highlighting the role of personal responsibility more explicitly, the response could have provided a deeper insight into the Christian perspective on sanctification."
