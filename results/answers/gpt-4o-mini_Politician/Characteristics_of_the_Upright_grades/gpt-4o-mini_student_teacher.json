  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive list of qualities that define an upright person in the biblical context. While the qualities mentioned align well with Christian values, the answer lacks a direct reference to obedience to God's laws, moral purity, and living a God-pleasing life, which are key aspects of biblical upright behavior. Encouraging the student to tie their excellent points back to these specific biblical principles would enhance the depth and accuracy of their response."
