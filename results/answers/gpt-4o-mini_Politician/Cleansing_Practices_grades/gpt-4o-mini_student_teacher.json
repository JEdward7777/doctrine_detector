  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed list of practical suggestions for modern Christians to reflect the concept of ritual cleanliness from the Old Testament, the answer lacks a direct connection to the core spiritual practices of repentance, confession, and spiritual discipline emphasized in the reference answer. The student's suggestions focus more on general spiritual growth and community engagement rather than specific practices tied to seeking moral and spiritual cleanliness. \n\nTo enhance the grade, the student could connect each suggested practice to the core spiritual disciplines outlined in the reference answer, emphasizing how each recommendation serves as a modern adaptation of these ancient practices. This alignment would strengthen the student's response and better reflect the concern of enhancing spiritual growth and accountability through incorporating ancient teachings into contemporary faith practice."
