The student effectively supports their points with relevant biblical examples and actions associated with compassion. The references to Jesus as the ultimate model of compassion and the various actions linked to compassion are accurate and well explained. The response could have been enhanced by including additional scriptural references to further strengthen the argument. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound explanation of biblical compassion."
