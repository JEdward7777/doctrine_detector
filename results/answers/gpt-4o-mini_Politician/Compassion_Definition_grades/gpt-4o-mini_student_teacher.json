  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a thorough explanation of biblical compassion, with relevant examples and actions associated with compassion, it goes beyond the reference answer by offering additional context and insights. The student effectively connects compassion to scriptural references and emphasizes the importance of empathy and action. Overall, the student demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical perspective on compassion and how it informs our interactions with others."
