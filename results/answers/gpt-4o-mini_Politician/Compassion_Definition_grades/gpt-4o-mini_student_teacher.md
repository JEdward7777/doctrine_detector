## [Answer](../Compassion_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Compassion, as defined in the Bible, is a deep awareness of the suffering of others coupled with the desire to help alleviate that suffering. This concept is seen throughout various scriptures, emphasizing empathy, kindness, and action.

1. **Biblical Examples**: Jesus is often portrayed as the ultimate model of compassion. In passages like Matthew 9:36, it describes Him as having compassion for the crowds because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. This illustrates caring deeply for others and recognizing their struggles.

2. **Actions of Compassion**: The Bible associates several actions with being compassionate:
   - **Helping Those in Need**: Acts of kindness, such as feeding the hungry (Matthew 25:35) or caring for the sick (Matthew 25:36).
   - **Forgiveness**: Showing mercy and forgiveness is a key aspect of compassion (Colossians 3:12).
   - **Advocating for the Vulnerable**: Taking action to protect and defend those who cannot defend themselves, such as the poor and marginalized (Proverbs 31:8-9).
   - **Empathetic Listening and Comfort**: Offering emotional support and being present for those in distress (Romans 12:15).

In summary, biblical compassion is characterized by a profound sense of empathy that inspires one to take meaningful action to support and uplift others in times of need.
