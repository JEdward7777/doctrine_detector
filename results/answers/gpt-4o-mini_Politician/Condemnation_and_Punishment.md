## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 offer a compassionate perspective that encourages us to rethink our views on punishment as a means of condemnation.

Matthew 12:7 states, "If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent." This emphasizes the importance of mercy over rigid adherence to rules or punishment. It suggests that when we encounter wrongdoing, our approach should prioritize understanding and compassion rather than condemnation. This invites us to reflect on the circumstances surrounding each situation and to consider a more rehabilitative approach to justice.

Psalms 34:22 reinforces this notion with the assurance that "The Lord redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned." This encourages a perspective of hope and redemption rather than finality in punishment. It emphasizes that even in the face of wrongdoing, there is an opportunity for restoration and support.

Collectively, these passages advocate for a justice system grounded in mercy and understanding rather than punitive measures. They encourage us to foster environments where individuals can learn and grow from their mistakes rather than feeling permanently condemned. By adopting these teachings, we can promote a more compassionate and humane approach to justice that recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals.
