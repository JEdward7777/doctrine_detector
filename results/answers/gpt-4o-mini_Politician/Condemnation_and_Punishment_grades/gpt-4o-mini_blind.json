  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The answer provides a good interpretation of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 in the context of punishment and condemnation, highlighting the themes of mercy, understanding, and redemption. The response effectively conveys the importance of approaching justice with compassion and rehabilitative intentions. However, to improve, the student could strengthen the connection between the verses and the Christian worldview, emphasizing the divine principles underlying mercy and redemption. More direct references to the doctrines of atonement and grace, central to the Christian faith, would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
