  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85. The student effectively addresses the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment by highlighting the importance of mercy over condemnation based on the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22. The response demonstrates an understanding of the compassionate perspective advocated in these verses and how it reshapes our views on punishment. However, the student could further strengthen their argument by explicitly connecting the teachings to the concept of divine justice and how it interacts with mercy in the context of punishment. Adding a more explicit connection to the concern provided would enhance the depth of analysis in the response."
