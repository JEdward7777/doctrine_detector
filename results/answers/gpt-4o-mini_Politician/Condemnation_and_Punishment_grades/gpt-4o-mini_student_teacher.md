## [Answer](../Condemnation_and_Punishment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 offer a compassionate perspective that encourages us to rethink our views on punishment as a means of condemnation.

Matthew 12:7 states, "If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent." This emphasizes the importance of mercy over rigid adherence to rules or punishment. It suggests that when we encounter wrongdoing, our approach should prioritize understanding and compassion rather than condemnation. This invites us to reflect on the circumstances surrounding each situation and to consider a more rehabilitative approach to justice.

Psalms 34:22 reinforces this notion with the assurance that "The Lord redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned." This encourages a perspective of hope and redemption rather than finality in punishment. It emphasizes that even in the face of wrongdoing, there is an opportunity for restoration and support.

Collectively, these passages advocate for a justice system grounded in mercy and understanding rather than punitive measures. They encourage us to foster environments where individuals can learn and grow from their mistakes rather than feeling permanently condemned. By adopting these teachings, we can promote a more compassionate and humane approach to justice that recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals.

85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer an 85. The student effectively addresses the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment by highlighting the importance of mercy over condemnation based on the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22. The response demonstrates an understanding of the compassionate perspective advocated in these verses and how it reshapes our views on punishment. However, the student could further strengthen their argument by explicitly connecting the teachings to the concept of divine justice and how it interacts with mercy in the context of punishment. Adding a more explicit connection to the concern provided would enhance the depth of analysis in the response.
