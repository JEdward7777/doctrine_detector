  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the relationship between confessing Jesus as Lord and being saved according to Paul's writings, referencing key passages like Romans 10:9-10. They correctly emphasized the importance of both belief and verbal confession in the process of salvation. The student effectively conveyed the significance of confessing Jesus as Lord as a transformative acknowledgment of His authority and divinity. However, there was some unnecessary elaboration in the response that could have been more concise, leading to a slightly lower grade."
