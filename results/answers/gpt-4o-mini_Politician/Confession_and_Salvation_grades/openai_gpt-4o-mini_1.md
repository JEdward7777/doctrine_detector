## [Answer](../Confession_and_Salvation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the writings of the Apostle Paul, particularly in the New Testament, the relationship between confessing that Jesus is Lord and being saved is articulated in a few key passages. One of the most prominent references is found in Romans 10:9-10, where Paul explains that if one confesses with their mouth that "Jesus is Lord" and believes in their heart that God raised Him from the dead, they will be saved. This passage emphasizes both the importance of belief and verbal confession in the process of salvation.

Confessing Jesus as Lord signifies an acknowledgment of His authority and divinity, indicating a personal commitment to Him. It is not purely a matter of stating a belief but involves a transformative recognition of who Jesus is and what His Lordship means for one's life. Paul's broader theological themes include grace, faith, and salvation through Christ, which together underscore that genuine faith often expresses itself through confession and lived experience.

In summary, according to Paul, confessing Jesus as Lord is an essential and integral aspect of the faith that leads to salvation, reflecting both inner belief and outward declaration. This understanding fosters a sense of community among believers, as it invites them to share their faith openly.
