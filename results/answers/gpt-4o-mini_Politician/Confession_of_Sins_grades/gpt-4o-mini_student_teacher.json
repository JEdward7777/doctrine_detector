  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical principles and practices to resist temptation, which align well with Christian teachings. However, the answer lacked a direct emphasis on the importance of confessing sins to God for forgiveness. While recognizing forgiveness was included in the response, a stronger emphasis on acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness would have aligned more closely with the reference answer. Overall, a good understanding of Christian principles in handling temptation was demonstrated."
