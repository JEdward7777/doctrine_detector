  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the biblical concept of conscience in a Christian context, supported by relevant scripture references and theological insights. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding conscience for moral decision-making. The only area for potential improvement could be to include a bit more direct engagement with specific scriptural teachings related to conscience, but overall, the response is very strong."
