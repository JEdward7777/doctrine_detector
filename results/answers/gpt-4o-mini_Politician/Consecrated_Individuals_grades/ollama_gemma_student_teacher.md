In the Bible, several individuals are noted for being consecrated to God, each serving unique roles within the biblical narrative. Here are some prominent figures:

1. **Samuel** - From a young age, Samuel was dedicated to the Lord by his mother, Hannah, and he served as a prophet and a judge in Israel.

2. **Nazirites** - Individuals such as Samson and John the Baptist are associated with the Nazirite vow, which involved a special consecration to God that included abstaining from certain substances and practices.

3. **Aaron** - As the first high priest, Aaron was consecrated to serve in the Tabernacle and lead the Israelites in worship.

4. **David** - Anointed by the prophet Samuel, David was consecrated as king of Israel, chosen by God to lead His people.

6. **The Levites** - This tribe was set apart for priestly duties and service to God, consecrated to handle the sacred items and perform rituals in the Temple.

These individuals exemplify the theme of being set apart for God's purposes, reflecting the diverse ways in which people can be dedicated to divine service throughout biblical history.

**Comments:**

The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of consecration to God in the Bible. They provide clear examples of individuals who were consecrated in various contexts, highlighting the diverse ways this practice manifested. 

While the reference answer focuses on specific groups identified as consecrated, the student's response goes beyond this and includes individual figures who dedicated themselves to God's service. This demonstrates a broader comprehension of the concept and provides a richer analysis. 

However, the answer could benefit from including a broader range of examples from different biblical periods and contexts. Additionally, some elaboration on the significance of each individual's consecration to their roles in shaping the biblical narrative would further strengthen the response.
