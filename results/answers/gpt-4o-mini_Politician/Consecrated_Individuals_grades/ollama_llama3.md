In the Bible, several individuals are noted for being consecrated to God, each serving unique roles within the biblical narrative. Here are some prominent figures:

1. **Samuel** - From a young age, Samuel was dedicated to the Lord by his mother, Hannah, and he served as a prophet and a judge in Israel.

2. **Nazirites** - Individuals such as Samson and John the Baptist are associated with the Nazirite vow, which involved a special consecration to God that included abstaining from certain substances and practices.

3. **Aaron** - As the first high priest, Aaron was consecrated to serve in the Tabernacle and lead the Israelites in worship.

4. **David** - Anointed by the prophet Samuel, David was consecrated as king of Israel, chosen by God to lead His people.

5. **Jeremiah** - The prophet Jeremiah was consecrated before his birth, with a divine calling to speak on behalf of God to the people of Israel.

6. **The Levites** - This tribe was set apart for priestly duties and service to God, consecrated to handle the sacred items and perform rituals in the Temple.

These individuals exemplify the theme of being set apart for God's purposes, reflecting the diverse ways in which people can be dedicated to divine service throughout biblical history.
