In the Bible, several individuals are noted for being consecrated to God, each serving unique roles within the biblical narrative. Here are some prominent figures:

1. **Samuel** - From a young age, Samuel was dedicated to the Lord by his mother, Hannah, and he served as a prophet and a judge in Israel.

2. **Nazirites** - Individuals such as Samson and John the Baptist are associated with the Nazirite vow, which involved a special consecration to God that included abstaining from certain substances and practices.

3. **Aaron** - As the first high priest, Aaron was consecrated to serve in the Tabernacle and lead the Israelites in worship.

4. **David** - Anointed by the prophet Samuel, David was consecrated as king of Israel, chosen by God to lead His people.

5. **Jeremiah** - The prophet Jeremiah was consecrated before his birth, with a divine calling to speak on behalf of God to the people of Israel.

6. **The Levites** - This tribe was set apart for priestly duties and service to God, consecrated to handle the sacred items and perform rituals in the Temple.
