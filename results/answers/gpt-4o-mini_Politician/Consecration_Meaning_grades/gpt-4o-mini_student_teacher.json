  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of consecration in a Christian context, emphasizing the act of making something holy or formally dedicating it to a sacred purpose. Their answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, demonstrating a strong understanding of the concept. However, deducting a few points for not explicitly highlighting the importance of consecration in serving God, as outlined in the specified concern. Overall, a solid response with room for improvement in tying the concept directly to serving God."
