  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained response to the question about the consequences of pride and the importance of humility according to the Bible. They referenced relevant scriptures and effectively highlighted the significance of humility in the life of a believer. However, the student may have benefitted from directly incorporating the teacher's reference answer to strengthen their response and provide a more comprehensive Christian worldview perspective on the spiritual implications of pride and humility."
