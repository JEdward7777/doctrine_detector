  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-thought-out list of approaches for Christians to identify corrupt influences in the world. However, the concern specifically highlights the importance of remaining vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living, focusing on behaviors and attitudes that contradict biblical teachings. While the student's answer touches on this aspect, it also delves into broader concepts of social justice, historical awareness, and community engagement. While these are valuable considerations, they may dilute the primary focus on identifying corrupt influences that lead away from godly living. Therefore, the grade reflects the comprehensive nature of the response but also suggests the need to refocus on the specific concern provided."
