The emphasis on biblical teachings, community engagement, critical analysis, prayer, advocacy for justice, historical awareness, ethical relationships, and education reflects a well-rounded Christian worldview in addressing the issue of corruption. The only slight deduction is due to the limited emphasis on the need for spiritual discernment through the Holy Spirit, which is a crucial component in recognizing and combating corrupt influences effectively."
