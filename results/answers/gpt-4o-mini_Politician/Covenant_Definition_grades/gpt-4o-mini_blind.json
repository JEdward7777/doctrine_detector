The emphasis on mutual commitments and God's promises is appropriate. The explanation could be strengthened by delving deeper into the theological significance of covenants as a reflection of God's faithfulness and grace, as well as the concept of covenantal relationship as a central theme throughout Scripture. Additionally, connecting covenants to the overarching narrative of salvation history would enhance the response."
