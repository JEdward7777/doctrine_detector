The student should have highlighted the biblical context of Luke 9:23, emphasizing that \"taking up your cross\" involves a willingness to die to oneself, to follow Christ wholeheartedly, and to embrace suffering for His sake. Incorporating more biblical references and theological depth would strengthen the explanation."
