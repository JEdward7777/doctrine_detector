  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a good overview of the primary role of a deacon in the local church, emphasizing service, support, ministry, care, and leadership. It correctly mentions assisting in practical aspects of church life and reaching out to those in need. However, to improve the grade, the answer could have included more specific references to biblical passages such as Acts 6:1-7 and 1 Timothy 3:8-13 which outline the qualifications and responsibilities of deacons. Additionally, mentioning the historical and scriptural foundation of the diaconate role would have added depth to the response."
