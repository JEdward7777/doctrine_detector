## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the Christian context, the term "adultery" is generally understood as a violation of the marital covenant, specifically involving a married person engaging in sexual relations with someone who is not their spouse. This concept is rooted in various passages of Scripture, notably in the Ten Commandments, where the commandment "You shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14) establishes the foundational principle of fidelity within marriage.

Additionally, Jesus expands on the understanding of adultery in the New Testament. For instance, in the Gospel of Matthew (5:27-28), He teaches that even looking at someone with lustful intent can be considered adultery in the heart. This emphasizes the importance of not only the physical act but also the thoughts and intentions behind it.

Different Christian denominations may emphasize particular aspects of this definition, and interpretations can vary based on cultural and theological perspectives. However, the core idea remains focused on the commitment to marital faithfulness as a key element of a healthy and loving relationship in the eyes of the Christian faith.
