  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of how adultery is defined in the Christian context according to Scripture. It accurately references key passages such as the Ten Commandments and Jesus' teaching in the New Testament. The student does well to highlight the broader implications of adultery beyond just the physical act, bringing in the importance of intentions and thoughts. To improve, they could have delved deeper into the theological significance of adultery within the Christian worldview and perhaps referenced additional Scriptures or theological perspectives on the topic."
