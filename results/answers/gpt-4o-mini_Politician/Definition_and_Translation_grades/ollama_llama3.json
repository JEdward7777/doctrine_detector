  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides some helpful alternative translations for the term \"intercede\", which goes beyond the provided answer of just three options. While it would have been beneficial to see more concrete biblical examples or applications of these translations, the explanation is clear and concise. The response also effectively addresses the concern by providing a range of alternatives that can help clarify the meaning and application of intercession in different contexts. However, the response could be improved with more depth and specific examples from Scripture to further illustrate the concepts being presented."
