## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In a biblical context, an angel is typically understood as a messenger from God. The term "angel" comes from the Greek word "angelos" and the Hebrew word "mal'akh," both of which mean "messenger." Angels are often depicted as spiritual beings who serve various roles, including delivering messages, providing guidance, offering protection, and executing God's will on Earth.

The primary roles of angels include:

1. **Messengers**: They deliver important messages to individuals, as seen in stories such as the Annunciation to Mary in the New Testament (Luke 1:26-38) and the messages to the shepherds at Jesus' birth (Luke 2:8-14).

2. **Guides and Protectors**: Many instances in scripture highlight angels acting as guides or protectors for God's people, offering support in times of need (e.g., Psalm 91:11-12).

3. **Worshipers of God**: Angels are also depicted as beings who worship God and participate in heavenly praise (e.g., Revelation 5:11-12).

4. **Instruments of God's Judgment**: In certain biblical narratives, angels carry out God's judgment or serve as agents of His decisions (e.g., the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis 19).

Overall, angels serve a divine purpose in the biblical narrative and play an important role in the relationship between God and humanity.
