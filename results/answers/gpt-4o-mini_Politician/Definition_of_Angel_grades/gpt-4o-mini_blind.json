  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a good overview of the biblical definition of angels and their primary roles. The student accurately highlights key aspects such as angels as messengers, guides, protectors, worshipers of God, and instruments of His judgment. The integration of relevant scriptural references enhances the accuracy and depth of the response. However, there could be further elaboration on the hierarchical structure of angels in Scripture, such as the distinctions between archangels and cherubim. Additionally, discussing the fallen angels (demons) and their role would provide a more comprehensive understanding of angelology in a biblical context."
