  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the biblical definition of an angel and their primary roles based on biblical references. The response effectively highlights the different aspects of angelic roles, including messengers, guides, protectors, worshipers, and instruments of God's judgment. The student could have slightly improved the clarity and conciseness of their explanation, aligning more closely with the concise definition provided in the reference answer."
