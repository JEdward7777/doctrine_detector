  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'beloved' in a biblical context, emphasizing its various dimensions and significance. They effectively connected it to the relationship between believers and God, albeit not directly addressing the depth of God's love for Jesus as specified in the concern. This answer demonstrates a good understanding of the term within a Christian worldview, but could have delved deeper into the specific relationship between God's love for Jesus and believers."
