They have covered key aspects such as invoking God's favor, protection, and goodwill, as well as the various forms blessings can take. However, the response could have been strengthened by incorporating more references to specific biblical teachings on blessings and the power of spoken blessings. Additionally, highlighting the role of God as the ultimate source of blessings would have further enriched the answer."
