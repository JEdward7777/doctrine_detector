  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This is a well-written response that accurately explains the term \"church\" in the New Testament from a Christian perspective. The answer correctly emphasizes the biblical understanding of the church as the assembly of believers in Jesus Christ, rather than just a physical building. It also touches on important aspects such as fellowship, sacraments, and the mission of the church. The student could further enhance the answer by incorporating specific biblical references to support their points."
