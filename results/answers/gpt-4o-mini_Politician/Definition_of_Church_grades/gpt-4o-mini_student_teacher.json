  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 80.\n\nWhile the student correctly emphasizes the church as the assembly or congregation of believers rather than just a physical building, and acknowledges the collaborative and unified nature of the church, there is a slight oversight in not specifically addressing the concern about the church's role being more than just a building. The student could have elaborated further on how the church is meant to be the living presence of Christ in the world, called to love and serve others beyond the confines of a physical structure. Additionally, while the student mentions the importance of fellowship, teaching, sacraments, and mission, they could have connected these aspects more explicitly to the church's role in embodying Christ to the world.\n\nOverall, the answer is well-informed and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of the church, but could have addressed the concern more directly to achieve a higher grade."
