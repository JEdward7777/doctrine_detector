  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of \"church\" in the New Testament. It accurately conveys the primary definition as the assembly or congregation of believers in Jesus Christ. Additionally, the explanation of the underlying Greek word \"ekklesia\" and its connection to the idea of being \"called out ones\" is insightful. The emphasis on the church as both a local community and the universal body of believers is also well-articulated. The student's response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, providing a nuanced understanding of the church's role beyond just a physical building."
