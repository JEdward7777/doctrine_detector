It also provides a clear definition of the Greek word \"ekklesia,\" which means \"called out ones.\" The response effectively highlights the biblical emphasis on fellowship, teaching, and mission, demonstrating an understanding of the church as a community of faith and the body of Christ.\n\nThe only deduction is for not explicitly stating that the church's role goes beyond just being a local assembly. However, the response does convey this understanding through its explanation of the Greek word \"ekklesia\" and the emphasis on the universal body of believers across the world. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the biblical concept of the church as more than just a physical building."
