  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament, highlighting its meaning as the assembly of believers rather than just a physical building. It effectively addresses the concern by expanding on the church's role as a community of faith, the body of Christ, and the importance of fellowship, teaching, sacraments, and mission. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of the church beyond a mere building."
