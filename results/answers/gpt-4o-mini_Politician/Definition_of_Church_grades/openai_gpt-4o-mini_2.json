  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament, emphasizing that it refers to the assembly or congregation of believers in Jesus Christ, rather than just a specific physical building. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the church as a community of faith and the body of Christ, focusing on the collaborative nature of worship and mission rather than just a place of gathering. Overall, the response aligns well with the Christian worldview of the church as a spiritual entity beyond physical structures."
