In the New Testament, the term "church" primarily refers to the assembly or congregation of believers in Jesus Christ, rather than a specific physical building. The Greek word used is "ekklesia," which means "called out ones." It can denote the local gatherings of Christians in different regions as well as the universal body of believers across the world. The church is described as both a community of faith and the body of Christ, emphasizing the collaborative nature of worship, support, and the sharing of teachings.

Overall, the term embodies the diverse expressions of Christian faith while emphasizing unity and shared purpose among believers.
