  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained answer about confession according to the Bible, touching on key aspects such as acknowledging sins, repentance, communal support, and the importance of confession for spiritual healing. The response aligns well with the biblical understanding of confession, showing a good grasp of the concept. One area for improvement could be to more directly tie the definition of confession to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
