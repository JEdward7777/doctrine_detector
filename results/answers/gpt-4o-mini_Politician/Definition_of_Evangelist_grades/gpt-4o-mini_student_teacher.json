  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the literal meaning of the term 'evangelist' as 'bringer of good news' or 'one who proclaims the gospel,' which aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and has effectively addressed the concern of understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
