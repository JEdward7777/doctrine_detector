The term 'evangelist' literally means 'bringer of good news' or 'one who proclaims the gospel.' It originates from the Greek word 'euangelistes,' which is derived from 'euangelion,' meaning 'good news' or 'gospel.' Traditionally, it refers to individuals who spread the message of Christianity, particularly the authors of the four gospels in the New Testament. In a broader context, the term can also refer to anyone who passionately promotes a particular cause or idea.
