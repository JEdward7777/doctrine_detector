  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive and thoughtful explanation of the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil' and their implications for moral decision-making, there are a couple of concerns. \n\nFirstly, the student's response lacks specificity in directly contrasting the concepts of 'good' and 'evil' as presented in the reference answer. The reference answer succinctly defines 'good' as morally right, emotionally pleasant, and beneficial, while 'evil' is portrayed as moral wrongness. The student's answer, while accurate and insightful, elaborates more on the characteristics and implications of 'good' and 'evil' without directly contrasting them as clearly as the reference answer.\n\nAdditionally, the student's discussion on the importance of sensitivity and awareness of diverse interpretations and beliefs surrounding these concepts, while valid, may detract slightly from the focus on the specific Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil' in the context of moral decision-making.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic but could improve by directly contrasting 'good' and 'evil' as defined in the Biblical context in relation to daily decision-making."
