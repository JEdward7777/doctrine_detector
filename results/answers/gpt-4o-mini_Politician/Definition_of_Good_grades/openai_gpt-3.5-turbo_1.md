# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Biblical definition of 'good' is often associated with qualities such as righteousness, love, compassion, justice, and obedience to God’s commandments. Goodness is primarily characterized by actions and intentions that align with the values and teachings found in scripture, which promote the well-being of individuals and communities.

In contrast, the concept of 'evil' in the Biblical context is typically understood as anything that opposes or contradicts these values. Evil is often characterized by selfishness, injustice, hatred, and actions that harm others or violate God's commandments. It represents a departure from the moral framework established in the Bible, leading to suffering and destruction.

The distinction between 'good' and 'evil' serves to guide moral conduct and underscores the importance of making choices that reflect positive, constructive values. In many religious teachings, the struggle between good and evil is seen as a fundamental aspect of human existence, encouraging individuals to pursue goodness in their lives while recognizing the potential for wrongdoing.

It’s essential to approach this topic with sensitivity and awareness of the diverse interpretations and beliefs surrounding these concepts, as different faith traditions and cultures may understand them in unique ways.
