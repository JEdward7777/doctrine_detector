  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil,' emphasizing the importance of aligning actions and intentions with scriptural values. It also addresses the concern of understanding the moral implications of these concepts in daily decision-making. The connection to Christian worldview principles is clear and well-articulated. However, there could have been more explicit references to specific Bible verses or teachings to further support the points made. Overall, a strong response that demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic from a Christian perspective."
