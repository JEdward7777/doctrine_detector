Comment: The student provided a clear and concise explanation of the term "gospel" both literally and in the context of the Bible. They accurately described the essence of the gospel as the good news of Jesus Christ and salvation, highlighting its significance in Christian belief. The answer could be strengthened by incorporating a brief mention of the historical-cultural context of the term and its roots in the Greek word "euangelion." Additionally, tying in the concept of repentance and faith as essential responses to the gospel message would have further enriched the explanation from a Christian worldview perspective.
