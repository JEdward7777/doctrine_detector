The term "gospel" literally means "good news." In the context of the Bible, it refers to the message of Jesus Christ and the salvation he offers. It encompasses the teachings of Jesus, his life, death, and resurrection, and the implications of these events for humanity. The four Gospels in the New Testament—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—present this good news through narratives of Jesus' ministry, emphasizing themes of love, grace, and redemption. The term is foundational to Christian belief, symbolizing the hope and joyful message central to the faith.
