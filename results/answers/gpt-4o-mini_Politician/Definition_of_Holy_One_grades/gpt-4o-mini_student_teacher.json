They effectively discuss the aspects of divine purity, covenantal relationship, Christological significance, call to holiness, and judgment and justice. However, the student could have further emphasized the centrality of God as the ultimate Holy One in the Bible and focused more on the distinction of God's holiness compared to humanity's fallen nature."
