The points made regarding divine purity, covenantal relationship, Christological significance, call to holiness, and judgment and justice effectively demonstrate an understanding of the holiness of God and His significance throughout biblical texts. The integration of both Old and New Testament perspectives enriches the overall depth of the explanation. Well done!"
