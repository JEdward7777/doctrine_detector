  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of the 'holy place' in the context of the tabernacle or temple, explaining its functions and symbolism well. However, there was a slight deviation from the central focus of the question, delving into the broader implications of sacred spaces and spirituality. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
