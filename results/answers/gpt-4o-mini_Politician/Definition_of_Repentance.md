In the context of the Bible, repentance is generally understood as a sincere and profound change of heart and mind regarding one’s actions, particularly in relation to sin and wrongdoing. It involves recognizing the error of one’s ways, feeling genuine remorse for those actions, and making a conscious decision to turn away from them and seek a better path, often characterized by striving to align oneself with moral and spiritual principles.

The Greek word for repentance, "metanoia," signifies a transformative change in one's life and outlook. In the New Testament, this concept is closely linked to the teachings of Jesus and is seen as an essential step toward receiving forgiveness and reconciliation with God. In the Old Testament, repentance often includes elements of returning to God, acknowledging one’s faults, and committing to follow His commandments.

Overall, repentance is a deeply personal process that can lead to healing, growth, and a renewed relationship with oneself and others, as well as with the divine.
