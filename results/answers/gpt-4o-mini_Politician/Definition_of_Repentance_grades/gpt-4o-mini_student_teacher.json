  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of repentance according to the Bible, touching on key aspects such as recognizing sin, feeling remorse, turning away from wrongdoing, and seeking alignment with moral and spiritual principles. They also incorporated the Greek word \"metanoia\" and highlighted the importance of repentance for forgiveness and reconciliation with God. However, the student's answer could benefit from placing stronger emphasis on the central aspect of turning away from sin and back to God, as emphasized in the reference answer. Encouraging a clearer focus on the need for redirection toward God in the process of repentance would strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
