In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" refers to individuals who are considered to be set apart for God or who have been made holy through faith in Jesus Christ. It is often used to describe members of the Christian community, emphasizing their status as believers who are dedicated to living in accordance with God's will. The term does not imply perfection; rather, it highlights the transformative relationship that believers have through their faith. In several letters, such as those written by the Apostle Paul, "saints" are collectively addressed, underscoring their shared identity in Christ and encouraging them in their spiritual journey. This concept emphasizes inclusivity, community, and the importance of living in love and service to one another.
