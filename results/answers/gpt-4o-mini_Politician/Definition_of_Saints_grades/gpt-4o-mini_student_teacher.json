  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"saints\" in the New Testament and discusses its implications for believers, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of emphasizing the transformative relationship through faith rather than the literal meaning of 'holy ones'. The explanation could be more focused on the essence of holiness and set-apartness rather than the transformative aspect of faith. It is important to stress the biblical definition and interpretation to maintain clarity and distinction from cultural understandings."
