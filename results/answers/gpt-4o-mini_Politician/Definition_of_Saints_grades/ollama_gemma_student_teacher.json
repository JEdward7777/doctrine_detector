  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately defines the Biblical meaning of \"saints\" as \"holy ones\" and emphasizes their status as believers in Jesus Christ. They also provide relevant examples from the New Testament, particularly Paul's letters, to support their explanation.
