The response does not explicitly mention biblical examples or passages that support this understanding, nor does it delve into the implications of sanctification for daily life as a believer. Nevertheless, it correctly identifies the essence of sanctification as setting apart or making holy, which is crucial to grasping the biblical definition of this term."
