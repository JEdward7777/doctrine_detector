  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of sanctification within a biblical context, addressing the concerns of holiness, separation, spiritual growth, and the call to action. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical definition of sanctification and effectively elaborates on its significance in relation to God and believers. The only room for slight improvement would be to include a specific reference to how sanctification involves being set apart for a special purpose in service to God."
