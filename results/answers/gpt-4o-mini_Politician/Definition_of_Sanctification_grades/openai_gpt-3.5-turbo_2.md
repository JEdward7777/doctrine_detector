## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In a biblical context, to sanctify means to make something holy or to set it apart for a special purpose, particularly in relation to God. This concept can be found in both the Old and New Testaments and involves different aspects of spiritual and moral purification.

1. **Holiness**: The term is often associated with holiness, indicating that something or someone is dedicated to God and His service.

2. **Separation**: Sanctification also implies a separation from common or secular use, elevating someone or something to a divine status or purpose.

3. **Spiritual Growth**: In the New Testament, sanctification is frequently linked to the process of spiritual growth and development in believers. It's seen as a transformative journey where individuals become more aligned with God's will and character.

4. **Call to Action**: Believers are encouraged to seek sanctification as part of their faith journey, striving to live in a way that reflects their dedication to God.

Overall, sanctification encompasses both the act of being set apart for God and the ongoing process of becoming more akin to His nature in one's thoughts, actions, and overall life.
