  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical concept of wisdom by highlighting key aspects such as the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom, practical applications of knowledge, compassion, humility, and love towards others. The answer is well-structured and provides a detailed explanation of how wisdom is viewed in the Bible. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of the simplicity and conciseness of the definition provided. Overall, the student's response effectively captures the essence of biblical wisdom and its significance in decision-making."
