In the biblical context, wisdom is often understood as the ability to discern what is true, right, and lasting, while making decisions that align with moral and ethical principles. The Bible presents wisdom as a gift from God, rooted in an understanding of His character and teachings.

One significant source is the Book of Proverbs, which frequently emphasizes that the "fear of the Lord" is the beginning of wisdom (Proverbs 1:7). This suggests that reverence for God and a commitment to living according to His guidance are foundational to gaining true wisdom. Additionally, biblical wisdom encompasses practical applications of knowledge, emphasizing actions and choices that lead to a fulfilling and righteous life.

Moreover, wisdom in the Bible is often portrayed as embodying compassion, humility, and love toward others. It encourages individuals to seek the welfare of their communities and to act with integrity.

In summary, according to the biblical definition, wisdom involves a deep understanding of life that combines knowledge, reverence for God, ethical living, and a commitment to the well-being of others. It advocates for thoughtful consideration, respect for divine principles, and the pursuit of justice and compassion in all aspects of life.
