  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of the biblical definition of a Christian. It accurately highlights key aspects such as belief in the divinity of Jesus, His resurrection, and salvation through Him. The student effectively uses scriptural references to support their points. The only area for improvement would be to elaborate further on the significance of repentance and surrender to Christ as essential components of being a Christian. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
