## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Christian.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The biblical definition of a "Christian" generally refers to an individual who adheres to the teachings of Jesus Christ and identifies themselves as a follower of Christ. This term is primarily derived from the New Testament of the Bible, which describes Christians as those who believe in the divinity of Jesus, His resurrection, and the salvation offered through Him.

In Acts 11:26, for instance, the term "Christian" is used to describe the disciples in Antioch, marking the first recorded instance of the label. Furthermore, 1 Peter 4:16 emphasizes that if anyone suffers as a Christian, they should not be ashamed, indicating a sense of identity and community among believers.

Overall, the biblical perspective emphasizes faith in Jesus, a commitment to His teachings, and a lifestyle that reflects His values, including love, compassion, and service towards others. Itâ€™s important to recognize that interpretations and practices can vary significantly among different denominations and cultural contexts within the broader Christian community.
