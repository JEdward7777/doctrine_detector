However, it lacks specificity in discussing the Christian perspective on miracles and God's authority. It would have been stronger if it delved deeper into the biblical understanding of miracles as recorded in the Bible and how they directly relate to God's authority as revealed in scripture. Additionally, while respecting diverse interpretations is important, the focus here should be on presenting a solid Christian perspective on miracles and their significance in demonstrating God's authority. More emphasis on biblical references and theological analysis would have strengthened the response."
