A miracle is generally understood as an extraordinary event that surpasses the natural laws and is typically attributed to a divine source. It often embodies a profound message of hope, faith, or transformation, reflecting the possibility of a reality beyond our everyday experiences. 

When discussing miracles in relation to God's authority, it's important to recognize that many faith traditions view miracles as demonstrations of divine power and the presence of a higher purpose. They can serve to inspire belief, reinforce faith in the divine, or provide comfort in times of need. In various spiritual contexts, miracles affirm the idea that God possesses the ultimate authority over the natural world, highlighting a connection between the divine and human experiences.

However, itâ€™s also important to respect the diverse interpretations of miracles across different cultures and belief systems. Each perspective brings its own valuable insights and teachings, contributing to our shared understanding of the human experience and our quest for meaning.
