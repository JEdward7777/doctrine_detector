  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85/100\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and concise explanation of the key differences between the terms 'exhort,' 'encourage,' and 'admonish.' They accurately differentiate the nuances of each term and provide examples of how they are used in communication. However, it would be beneficial for the student to include scriptural references or examples illustrating these concepts within a Christian context to enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
