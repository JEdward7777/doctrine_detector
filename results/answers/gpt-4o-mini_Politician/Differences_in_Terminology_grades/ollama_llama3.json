  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the nuances between \"exhort\", \"encourage\", and \"admonish\". It accurately highlights the distinct connotations and tones associated with each term, which is essential for effectively communicating encouragement according to scripture. However, while it provides a clear breakdown of each term's meaning, it does not explicitly connect these concepts to biblical principles or examples. To fully address the concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture, the response could have provided more explicit references to relevant passages and applications.\n\nThe given answer is somewhat simplistic and lacks the depth and nuance presented in the graded response. While it does provide a basic understanding of each term's meaning, it does not capture the subtleties and differences between \"exhort\", \"encourage\", and \"admonish\"."
