The points made about diverse backgrounds, symbolic significance, intimate teaching, leadership development, and diverse perspectives align well with Christian doctrine. The answer effectively highlights the significance of their selection in establishing the foundation of the early Church. However, it could be strengthened by more direct references to relevant biblical passages or teachings to further support the points made. Overall, a solid examination of the topic from a Christian worldview."
