  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer outlining various reasons for why the twelve apostles were chosen as Jesus' closest disciples. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes the apostles' specific role in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church. The student's response covers additional aspects such as diverse backgrounds, symbolic significance, intimate teaching, leadership development, and diverse perspectives, which while insightful, may have slightly deviated from the core concern of the apostles' role and significance in the New Testament. Strengthening the alignment with the reference answer would enhance the overall grade."
