The twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus as his closest disciples for several reasons that reflect both spiritual and practical considerations. 

1. **Diverse Backgrounds**: The apostles represented a range of backgrounds and professions, which emphasized inclusivity and the universal nature of Jesusâ€™ message. They included fishermen, a tax collector, and individuals from different walks of life, showcasing that anyone can be called to follow a higher purpose.

2. **Symbolic Significance**: The number twelve is often seen as significant in biblical tradition, symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel. By choosing twelve apostles, Jesus was establishing a foundation for a new community and covenant, paralleling the history of the Jewish faith.

3. **Intimate Teaching**: Jesus sought individuals to whom he could teach his message more intimately. The apostles would not only learn from his teachings but also witness his miracles and experiences directly. This close relationship allowed them to develop a deeper understanding of his mission.

4. **Leadership Development**: Jesus aimed to train these individuals to lead others after his ascension. By investing in the apostles, he was equipping them with the knowledge and experience they would need to spread his teachings and establish the early Church.

5. **Diverse Perspectives**: Each apostle brought unique perspectives and qualities to the group, which enriched their discussions and experiences. This diversity allowed for a richer understanding of Jesus' teachings and how they could be applied in different contexts.

In conclusion, the selection of the twelve apostles demonstrates Jesus' intention to create a diverse, inclusive, and well-rounded group to advance his mission and foster leadership in early Christianity. Their experiences and backgrounds helped shape the foundation of the faith, which continues to resonate with many today.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer outlining various reasons for why the twelve apostles were chosen as Jesus' closest disciples. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes the apostles' specific role in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church. The student's response covers additional aspects such as diverse backgrounds, symbolic significance, intimate teaching, leadership development, and diverse perspectives, which while insightful, may have slightly deviated from the core concern of the apostles' role and significance in the New Testament. Strengthening the alignment with the reference answer would enhance the overall grade.
