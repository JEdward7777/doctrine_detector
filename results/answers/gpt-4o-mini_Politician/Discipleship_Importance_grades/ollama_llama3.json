  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response exceeds the minimum requirement by providing specific reasons why Jesus chose the twelve apostles, such as their diverse backgrounds, symbolic significance, intimate teaching, leadership development, and diverse perspectives. The writer also effectively connects these reasons to the overall mission of Jesus and the establishment of the early Church.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more concise in presenting its arguments. Some of the points are repeated or could be combined to make the response more efficient. Additionally, while the response does a good job of highlighting the significance of the apostles, it would benefit from a clearer explanation of how this relates specifically to the concern about understanding their role and significance in the New Testament.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern by providing specific reasons why Jesus chose the twelve apostles and exploring their role in establishing the early Church."
