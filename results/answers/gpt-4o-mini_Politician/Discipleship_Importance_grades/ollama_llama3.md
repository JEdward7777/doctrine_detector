The twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus as his closest disciples for several reasons that reflect both spiritual and practical considerations. 

1. **Diverse Backgrounds**: The apostles represented a range of backgrounds and professions, which emphasized inclusivity and the universal nature of Jesusâ€™ message. They included fishermen, a tax collector, and individuals from different walks of life, showcasing that anyone can be called to follow a higher purpose.

2. **Symbolic Significance**: The number twelve is often seen as significant in biblical tradition, symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel. By choosing twelve apostles, Jesus was establishing a foundation for a new community and covenant, paralleling the history of the Jewish faith.

3. **Intimate Teaching**: Jesus sought individuals to whom he could teach his message more intimately. The apostles would not only learn from his teachings but also witness his miracles and experiences directly. This close relationship allowed them to develop a deeper understanding of his mission.

4. **Leadership Development**: Jesus aimed to train these individuals to lead others after his ascension. By investing in the apostles, he was equipping them with the knowledge and experience they would need to spread his teachings and establish the early Church.

5. **Diverse Perspectives**: Each apostle brought unique perspectives and qualities to the group, which enriched their discussions and experiences. This diversity allowed for a richer understanding of Jesus' teachings and how they could be applied in different contexts.

In conclusion, the selection of the twelve apostles demonstrates Jesus' intention to create a diverse, inclusive, and well-rounded group to advance his mission and foster leadership in early Christianity. Their experiences and backgrounds helped shape the foundation of the faith, which continues to resonate with many today.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response exceeds the minimum requirement by providing specific reasons why Jesus chose the twelve apostles, such as their diverse backgrounds, symbolic significance, intimate teaching, leadership development, and diverse perspectives. The writer also effectively connects these reasons to the overall mission of Jesus and the establishment of the early Church.

The only area for improvement is that the response could be more concise in presenting its arguments. Some of the points are repeated or could be combined to make the response more efficient. Additionally, while the response does a good job of highlighting the significance of the apostles, it would benefit from a clearer explanation of how this relates specifically to the concern about understanding their role and significance in the New Testament.

Overall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern by providing specific reasons why Jesus chose the twelve apostles and exploring their role in establishing the early Church.
