## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
After King Solomon's reign, a significant event in Israel's history was the division of the united kingdom. Following Solomon's death around 931 BCE, the kingdom was split into two separate kingdoms: the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. This division occurred due to a combination of political and social factors, including discontent with heavy taxation and forced labor policies implemented during Solomon's rule. The split marked a pivotal moment in ancient Israelite history, leading to different paths for the two kingdoms, particularly in terms of governance, culture, and religious practices.
