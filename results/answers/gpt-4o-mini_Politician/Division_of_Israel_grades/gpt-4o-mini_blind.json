  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: This is a well-written and informative response, accurately highlighting the division of the united kingdom into Israel and Judah after King Solomon's reign. The student effectively captures the key political and social factors that led to this significant event in Israel's history. The doctrinal correctness is particularly strong in emphasizing the repercussions of the split on governance, culture, and religious practices in the two kingdoms. Great job!"
