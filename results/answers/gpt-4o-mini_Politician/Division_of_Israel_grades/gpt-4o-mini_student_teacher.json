  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a good understanding of the historical significance of the division of the Israelites after King Solomon's reign. They have accurately described the split into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah and mentioned some key factors contributing to this division. However, the student's answer could have been improved by providing more insights into the spiritual significance of this division from a Christian worldview perspective. Incorporating scriptural references or discussing the spiritual lessons that can be learned from this event would have enhanced their answer."
