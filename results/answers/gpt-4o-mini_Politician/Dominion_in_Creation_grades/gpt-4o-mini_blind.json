The answer accurately references Genesis 1:26-28 and highlights the importance of stewardship and responsible care of the environment. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing more on the biblical perspective that dominion involves subduing and ruling over creation in accordance with God's will, rather than just stewardship and care. Additionally, including more specific examples or references to other relevant biblical passages could strengthen the argument. Overall, a solid response but could benefit from deeper theological insight."
