It aligns well with the concern of understanding God-given authority over creation and showcases a Christian worldview of viewing humanity's role as caretakers of the earth. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the concept of dominion to the importance of exercising it responsibly in line with God's will."
