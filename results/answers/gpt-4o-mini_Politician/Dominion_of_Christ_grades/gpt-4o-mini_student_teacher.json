  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed and well-supported answer that highlights various aspects of Jesus Christ's dominion in the Bible, the answer lacked the explicit mention of Jesus functioning as prophet, priest, and king, which is the important reference point provided by the teacher. This key aspect is crucial in understanding the full extent of Jesus' dominion and authority in all aspects of life. The student effectively incorporated relevant Bible verses to support their points and showcased a good understanding of Jesus Christ's role as depicted in scripture. However, the oversight of not directly addressing the prophet, priest, and king roles may have hindered the completeness of the response."
