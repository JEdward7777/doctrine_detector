However, it could be improved by emphasizing the need for readiness and vigilance in light of the uncertainty surrounding the duration of the last days, in line with passages such as Matthew 24:36-44. Additionally, mentioning the importance of living out one's faith and actively seeking to fulfill God's will during this period would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
