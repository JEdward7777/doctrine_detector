The duration of "the last days" is not specifically defined in the Bible. Various interpretations exist among different theological perspectives. Generally, "the last days" often refers to a period of time leading up to significant events, such as the return of Christ or the fulfillment of God's promises. Biblical texts, such as those found in the Old and New Testaments, describe this period in a variety of ways, focusing more on the signs and events associated with it rather than providing a clear timeline. Therefore, many believers approach the topic with a sense of hope and anticipation, emphasizing the importance of living in a way that reflects their values and beliefs.
