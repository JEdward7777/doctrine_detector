  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical perspective on the duration of \"the last days.\" They correctly point out that the specific timeframe is not explicitly defined in the Bible and that different theological interpretations exist. Additionally, they provide relevant examples from biblical texts to support their claim. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct statement regarding the unknown duration of the \"last days\" as specified in the teacher's reference answer."
