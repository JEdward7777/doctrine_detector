It acknowledges the uncertainty without detracting from the importance of living in anticipation of Christ's return. The emphasis on living out faith in alignment with values and beliefs is commendable. However, to improve the response, a stronger connection could be made between the uncertainty of the timeline and its impact on how Christians should actively engage in their faith and readiness for Christ's return."
