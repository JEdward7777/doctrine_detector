  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the story of Gideon and the creation of the golden ephod, touching on important lessons about idolatry, leadership, accountability, community reflection, and human nature. However, the student's answer did not directly address the specified concern of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith. While the student's points were insightful and relevant, a stronger connection to the specified concern would have enhanced the overall response."
