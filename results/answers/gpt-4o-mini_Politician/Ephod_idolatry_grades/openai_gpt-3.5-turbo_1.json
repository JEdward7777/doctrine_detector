It aligns well with the concern of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith, emphasizing the dangers of idolatry and the need for spiritual integrity. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to more explicitly tie each lesson back to the overarching theme of avoiding idolatry and staying focused on true worship of God."
