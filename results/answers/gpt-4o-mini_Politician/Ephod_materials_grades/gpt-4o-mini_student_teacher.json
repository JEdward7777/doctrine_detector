  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student accurately identified the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod, demonstrating a good understanding of their significance and symbolism in worship. However, the student included fine linen as one of the materials, which was not part of the specific embroidery mentioned in the reference answer. Despite this minor discrepancy, the response effectively highlights the importance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship."
