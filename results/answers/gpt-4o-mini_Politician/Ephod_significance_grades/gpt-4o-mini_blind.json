  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a well-rounded explanation of the significance of the high priest's ephod in the context of Old Testament worship. It effectively highlights the symbolic, practical, and spiritual aspects associated with the garment. The integration of key elements such as priesthood symbolism, materials, divine guidance through the Urim and Thummim, covenant relationship, and liturgical function demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. However, to enhance the response further, additional Scriptural references or direct quotes could have been included to support the interpretation of the significance of the ephod more explicitly."
