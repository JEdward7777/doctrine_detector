  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a well-rounded overview of various theological perspectives on the concept of eternal punishment in relation to God's justice. They correctly touch upon important aspects such as moral order, free will, contrast to grace, ultimate justice, and the invitation to reflection. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the foundational doctrine of sin as the root cause of eternal punishment, and the necessity of God's justice being satisfied through Christ's atoning sacrifice. Additionally, a clearer stance on the student's own beliefs and the centrality of the Gospel message could have strengthened the response. Overall, a good overview but with room for improvement in depth and clarity from a Christian worldview perspective."
