  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of eternal punishment in hell and its reflection of God's justice. The student acknowledges the complexity of the topic and explores various theological perspectives, providing a well-rounded analysis. The inclusion of contrasting ideas like grace and free will adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could benefit from a clearer articulation of how the concept of hell aligns with the Christian worldview, particularly in reference to the teacher's reference answer."
