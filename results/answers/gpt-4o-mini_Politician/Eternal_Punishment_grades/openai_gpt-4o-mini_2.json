  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 70.\n\nWhile the response does a good job of discussing various theological perspectives on eternal punishment and its relationship to divine justice, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. The response does not specifically engage with the concern raised in the grading criteria, which is a significant aspect of the assignment. However, the response effectively presents a well-rounded view of the topic from different theological viewpoints and demonstrates respect for diverse beliefs, which are both positive aspects of the answer."
