They accurately capture the expanded understanding of eunuchs as including those who choose celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. However, the response could benefit from a deeper exploration of the theological significance of celibacy within the Christian tradition, such as how celibacy is seen as a way to dedicate oneself fully to God's service and the eschatological significance of celibacy in light of the Kingdom of Heaven. Additionally, integrating scriptural references or insights from Christian theologians on celibacy could strengthen the argument."
