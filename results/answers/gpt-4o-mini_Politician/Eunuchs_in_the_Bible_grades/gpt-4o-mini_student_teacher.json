  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful analysis of Matthew 19:12 and the concept of celibacy within a Christian worldview. They accurately explained Jesus' reference to eunuchs encompassing those who choose celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven, as well as other reasons for celibacy. However, the student missed directly referencing that Jesus acknowledged some are eunuchs by birth, others by choice, and that celibacy can be a valid option for spiritual devotion. The answer could have been improved by integrating more directly the specific points made in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
