The explanation aligns well with Christian teachings on celibacy and the diverse reasons individuals may choose to live a life without marriage. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the theological significance and spiritual commitment inherent in choosing celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven."
