  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response provides a variety of ways individuals can exalt God in their daily lives, it falls short in truly understanding the importance of exalting God above all else. The response focuses more on general moral and ethical behaviors rather than emphasizing the centrality of worship, prayer, and living according to God's will. It misses the mark on highlighting the ultimate importance of putting God first in all aspects of life according to a Christian worldview."
