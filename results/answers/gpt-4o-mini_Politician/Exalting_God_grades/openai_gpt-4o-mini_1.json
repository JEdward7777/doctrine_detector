However, the response falls short of emphasizing the central Christian belief that exalting God primarily involves highly praising and honoring Him through worship, prayer, and living according to His will. While the suggestions given are good practices, they lack a focused emphasis on the foundational aspect of exalting God in a Christian worldview."
