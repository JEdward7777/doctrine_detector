  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 80. The student accurately provided detailed examples of demon possession from the Bible, showcasing a good understanding of the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative. The student also shared how these instances highlight the struggle between good and evil, and the power of Jesus to heal and restore. However, the student's response did not reference the concern provided explicitly, which could have strengthened the alignment with a Christian specific worldview. Overall, a solid response with room for further integration of the specified concern."
