The student effectively references key narratives such as Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, David and Bathsheba, the Prodigal Son, and Peter's denial of Jesus to illustrate different aspects of guilt, accountability, repentance, and redemption within a Christian worldview. The response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications of guilt, such as the idea of sin, the role of conscience, and the importance of seeking forgiveness from God. Overall, a solid exploration of the topic with room for deeper theological reflection."
