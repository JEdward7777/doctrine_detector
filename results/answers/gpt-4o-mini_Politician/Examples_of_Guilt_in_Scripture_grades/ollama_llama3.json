  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response provides several examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of guilt, including stories about Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, David and Bathsheba, the Prodigal Son, and Peter's denial of Jesus. These examples do explore how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, as they show characters experiencing feelings of guilt and shame due to their actions or omissions.\n\nHowever, while the response mentions the concept of guilt and its implications, it does not directly address the concern about divine judgment. The provided answer is more focused on individual experiences of guilt and redemption, rather than specifically examining how these experiences relate to a divine justice system.\n\nTo better align with the concern, the response could have delved deeper into biblical passages that highlight God's justice and judgment, such as Psalm 7:11-12 or Revelation 20:4-6. By incorporating more scriptural evidence and analysis, the response could strengthen its connection to the concern about divine judgment.\n\nOverall, while this response is well-structured and provides several relevant examples, it falls short of fully addressing the concern about divine judgment."
