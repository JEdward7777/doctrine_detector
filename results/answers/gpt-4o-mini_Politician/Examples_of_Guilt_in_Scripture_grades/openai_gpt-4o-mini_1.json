The examples provided showcase how guilt operates in relation to divine judgment, illustrating the need for accountability and repentance. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of how guilt is portrayed in the Bible and how it ties into the Christian worldview of justice and redemption. Great job incorporating relevant biblical narratives to address the concern at hand."
