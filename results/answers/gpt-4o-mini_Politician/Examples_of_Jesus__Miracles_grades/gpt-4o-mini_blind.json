  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive list of significant miracles performed by Jesus, along with their respective meanings and implications. The explanations are solid and align well with Christian doctrine. However, the student could enhance the answer by further connecting these miracles to specific theological principles and citing relevant biblical passages to support their interpretations. Additionally, a more explicit emphasis on the divine nature of Jesus and the salvific significance of these miracles would strengthen the answer."
