  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful list of specific miracles performed by Jesus, highlighting their significance in relation to his teachings and ministry. The examples chosen demonstrated a deep understanding of the theological implications of each miracle and how they point towards Jesus' divinity and the coming of God's kingdom. The student effectively connected the miracles to broader themes such as compassion, faith, and hope, aligning well with the Christian worldview. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly emphasizing how these miracles specifically contribute to our belief in Jesus as the Son of God, as per the specified concern. Overall, a well-researched and well-articulated response."
