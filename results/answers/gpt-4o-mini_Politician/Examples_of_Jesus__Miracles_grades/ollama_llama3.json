  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive overview of Jesus' miracles, highlighting their significance and relevance to Christian theology. The writer has done an excellent job of explaining each miracle in detail, using biblical references to support their claims. Additionally, they have successfully connected the dots between the miracles and the themes of compassion, faith, and hope that resonate within the Christian tradition.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern about recognizing Jesus' divinity. While the writer does mention God's kingdom and Jesus' identity as Son of God in passing, they could have further emphasized how the miracles serve as signs of His divinity and helped build faith in His divine nature.\n\nOverall, however, this response is well-written, informative, and effectively communicates the significance of Jesus' miracles."
