  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough and thoughtful exploration of how true faith in Jesus can manifest in a person's life, encompassing various aspects of personal and communal expressions of belief. However, the answer lacks a direct connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher, which highlights the importance of good spiritual fruits or behaviors produced through faith in Jesus because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Integrating this key Christian worldview concept more explicitly would strengthen the student's response."
