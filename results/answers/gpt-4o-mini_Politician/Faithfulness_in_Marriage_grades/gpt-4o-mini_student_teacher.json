  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 95.\n\nThe student accurately describes key biblical teachings on faithfulness in marriage, referencing relevant passages in both the Old and New Testaments. They highlight the sacred nature of marriage as a covenant and the expectation of fidelity, incorporating teachings from Exodus, Matthew, and the letters of Paul to support their points. The student effectively communicates the importance of maintaining integrity and faithfulness in marriages based on Christian teachings. They could have strengthened their response by directly quoting the specific passage from Matthew 5:28 provided in the reference answer to further support the point about adultery and intent. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on faithfulness in marriage."
