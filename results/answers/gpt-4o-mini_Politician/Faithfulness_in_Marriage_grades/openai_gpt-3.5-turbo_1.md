# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Bible offers various teachings on the subject of faithfulness in marriage, particularly regarding the seriousness of adultery. In the context of faithfulness, marriage is often depicted as a sacred covenant, emphasizing the importance of loyalty, commitment, and love between partners.

One of the most commonly referenced passages is found in the Ten Commandments, specifically Exodus 20:14, which states, "You shall not commit adultery." This command highlights the expectation of fidelity and serves as a clear directive against infidelity.

In the New Testament, Jesus addresses the subject in Matthew 19:4-6, where He affirms the sanctity of marriage and the notion that a marital bond is meant to be a lifelong commitment. Additionally, in Matthew 5:27-28, Jesus expands on the idea of adultery, indicating that even lustful thoughts can be equated with the act itself, thus calling for a deeper level of commitment and purity in relationships.

Furthermore, the Apostle Paul addresses marital faithfulness in his letters, noting the importance of love, mutual respect, and fidelity as key components of a healthy marriage (e.g., Ephesians 5:25-33).

Overall, the biblical view encourages couples to uphold their vows and emphasizes the importance of faithfulness as a reflection of their love and commitment to one another and their relationship with God. These teachings can foster values that promote strong, loving, and lasting relationships within marriage.
