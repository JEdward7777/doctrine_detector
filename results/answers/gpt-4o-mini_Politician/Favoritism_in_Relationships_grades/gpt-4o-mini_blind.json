  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of what favoritism entails and its potential effects on relationships. They have correctly highlighted key negative consequences such as inequality, division, demotivation, communication barriers, and negative perceptions. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of fairness, transparency, and valuing others as integral to fostering healthy relationships. A higher grade could be achieved by integrating biblical principles or references that address favoritism directly, such as James 2:1-4, which warns against showing favoritism in our interactions with others."
