  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of the negative effects of favoritism in relationships, highlighting the importance of fairness, transparency, and inclusivity. The Christian concern for avoiding favoritism and promoting equal treatment of all individuals is clearly addressed and supported throughout the response. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly incorporate a Christian perspective or biblical references to strengthen the argument further."
