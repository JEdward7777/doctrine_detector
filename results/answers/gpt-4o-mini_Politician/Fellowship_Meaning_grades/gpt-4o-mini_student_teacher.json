  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out answer that effectively captures the essence of fellowship in a Christian context. They have highlighted the importance of unity, love, and mutual support among believers. However, there is some additional elaboration beyond the reference answer, which is good in terms of depth of understanding. The student could have slightly focused more on the spiritual aspect of fellowship to align more closely with the concern provided. Overall, a very good response."
