In a biblical context, to "find favor" with someone typically refers to receiving goodwill, approval, or a supportive relationship from a person or, in a broader sense, from God. The concept is often associated with grace and kindness, reflecting a positive and often transformative relationship.

For instance, when individuals like Noah or Mary (the mother of Jesus) are said to have found favor, it indicates that they were seen as righteous or chosen for a special purpose, and that they were recipients of divine blessing or protection. This idea underscores themes of mercy, grace, and the importance of moral integrity in building relationships, not only with others but also with the divine. 

Overall, finding favor can be seen as an invitation to a deeper connection or responsibility, characterized by trust and mutual support.
