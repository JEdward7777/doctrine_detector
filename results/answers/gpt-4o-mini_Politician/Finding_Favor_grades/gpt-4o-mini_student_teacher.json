They effectively connected the concept to receiving goodwill or approval, particularly from God, and highlighted its significance in relationships and divine intervention. However, the student went beyond the specific concern provided by emphasizing themes of mercy, grace, and moral integrity, which, while valuable in a broader theological discussion, slightly deviates from the focus on mutual approval and blessing in relationships."
