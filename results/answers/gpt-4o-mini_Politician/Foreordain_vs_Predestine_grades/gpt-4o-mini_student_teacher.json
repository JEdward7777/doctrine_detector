  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained response that delves into the nuances of the terms \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" in Christian teachings. They have accurately described the key differences between the two terms and their implications within theology. The only suggestion for improvement would be to more explicitly tie in the overarching theme of God's authority in the plan, as highlighted in the reference answer."
