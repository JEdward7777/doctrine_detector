While it's correct that \"foreordain\" emphasizes God's authority, the explanation is quite superficial and doesn't delve deeper into the implications and theological nuances surrounding these terms. The response also doesn't fully address the concern of clarifying the relationship between similar theological concepts. To improve, the response could provide more specific examples or biblical references to support its claims and explore the differences and similarities between \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\"."
