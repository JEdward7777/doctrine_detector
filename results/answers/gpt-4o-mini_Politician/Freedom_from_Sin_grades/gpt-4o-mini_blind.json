  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 85. \n\nThe student provides a comprehensive and well-organized explanation of how being bound by sin can hinder a Christian's relationship with God, touching on key points such as spiritual separation, guilt and shame, struggle with identity, and impaired decision-making. They also offer practical and biblically sound suggestions for finding freedom from these bonds, including confession and repentance, prayer, seeking community support, embracing grace, engaging in spiritual practices, and seeking professional guidance when needed.\n\nHowever, the answer could be improved by incorporating more specific references to relevant Bible verses or Christian doctrines supporting their points. Additionally, while the suggestions for finding freedom are valuable, emphasizing the foundational role of faith in Christ's redemptive work would enhance the overall doctrinal correctness of the response."
