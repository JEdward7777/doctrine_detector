  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful answer addressing the ways in which being 'bound' by sin can hinder a Christian's relationship with God and offered practical steps to find freedom from these bonds. The response demonstrated a good understanding of the Christian perspective on sin and repentance. However, the student could have emphasized the centrality of repentance and faith in Jesus as the ultimate solution to finding freedom from sin. Overall, a well-structured and insightful response."
