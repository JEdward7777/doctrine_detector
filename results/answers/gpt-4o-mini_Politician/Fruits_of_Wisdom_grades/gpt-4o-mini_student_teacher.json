  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the fruits of the Holy Spirit based on Galatians 5:22-23 and how these qualities can be manifested in one's life. While the answer covered all the fruits of the Spirit, it was perhaps overly detailed for the given concern, which highlighted joy, kindness, love, and patience as essential fruits for a wise person to exhibit. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have focused more on the specific fruits mentioned in the reference answer."
