It acknowledges the significance of fulfilled prophecies in demonstrating God's sovereignty and involvement in human history. The response could have been strengthened by directly linking the idea of God causing the fulfillment of prophecies to the example of Jesus fulfilling Old Testament prophecies, illustrating this concept with a specific biblical reference."
