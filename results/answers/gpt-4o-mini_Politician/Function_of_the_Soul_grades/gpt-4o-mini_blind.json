The points raised are supported by relevant biblical references and demonstrate a good understanding of the holistic nature of the soul as portrayed in scripture. The explanation is clear, insightful, and reflects a sound Christian worldview in discussing the spiritual, emotional, relational, moral, and eternal dimensions of human identity. Great job overall!"
