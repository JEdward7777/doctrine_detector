However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that true holiness ultimately stems from God and is not merely defined by human perception or cultural practices. While the response touches on the significance of historical events and personal sacred spaces, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing the primacy of God's presence as the foundation of holiness in any place. Encouraging a deeper reflection on the biblical understanding of holiness and sacred spaces would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
