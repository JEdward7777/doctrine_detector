However, the answer does not specifically address the concern of identifying places dedicated to divine encounter, which is important in a Christian worldview that emphasizes the sacredness of spaces for worship and encountering God. The response could have been improved by incorporating a clearer connection to the concept of dedicated spaces for divine encounter within the broader discussion of holy places."
