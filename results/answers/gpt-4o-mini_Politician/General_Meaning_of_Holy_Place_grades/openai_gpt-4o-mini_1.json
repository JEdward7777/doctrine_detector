  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed and thoughtful exploration of various types of holy places beyond just those dedicated to worship, reflecting a broad and inclusive perspective on holiness. However, there is a lack of specific focus on places dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter as mentioned in the concern. While the response acknowledges the diversity of sacred spaces, it does not adequately emphasize the importance of places set apart for God in a worship context from a Christian worldview."
