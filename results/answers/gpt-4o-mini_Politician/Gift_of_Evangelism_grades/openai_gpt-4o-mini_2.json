The answer effectively addresses the concern by acknowledging the spiritual gift of evangelism and its significance within the church. However, it could have delved deeper into the biblical basis for spiritual gifts, such as referencing passages like 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12. Overall, a solid response with a good Christian worldview perspective."
