  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily lives, encompassing both personal actions and interactions with others. While their suggestions are valuable and align with Christian principles of love, kindness, and service, the answer lacks a focused emphasis on sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments. Encouraging the student to prioritize these specific actions would further emphasize the importance of honoring God's greatness in daily life."
