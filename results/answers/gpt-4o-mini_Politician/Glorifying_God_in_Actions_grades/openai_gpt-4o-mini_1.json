While these suggestions are valuable and align with Christian principles, the overall focus somewhat diverged from the specific emphasis on sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments to reflect His glory. The response could have been strengthened by more directly connecting the suggested actions to the core idea of reflecting God's greatness through personal testimony and adherence to His attributes."
