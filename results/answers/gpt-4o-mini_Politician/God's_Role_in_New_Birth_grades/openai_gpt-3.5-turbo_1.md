# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The concept of being "born again" is often associated with spiritual renewal and transformation in many religious traditions, particularly in Christianity. In this context, God's role is generally viewed as both initiating and facilitating this process. 

From a theological perspective, many believe that God offers grace, which empowers individuals to seek spiritual rebirth. This may involve enlightenment, inspiration, and the calling of the Holy Spirit, guiding a person towards faith and repentance. The idea is that individuals have the capacity to make choices in their spiritual journey, but it is God's influence and grace that make this transformation possible.

It's important to acknowledge that different faith traditions and individual beliefs may offer varying interpretations of God's role in this process. Engaging with these differing views can enhance mutual understanding and respect among diverse communities.
