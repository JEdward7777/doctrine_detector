They accurately highlight the divine nature and moral perfection of God as the standard of goodness. The student effectively connects the statement to humility and the role of faith in moral development. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly stating that the statement emphasizes the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness, as outlined in the reference answer."
