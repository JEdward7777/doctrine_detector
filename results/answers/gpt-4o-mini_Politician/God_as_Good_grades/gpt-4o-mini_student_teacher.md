## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
When Jesus states, "There is only one who is good, and that is God," he is emphasizing the unique and ultimate goodness of God in comparison to human beings. This statement suggests that while humans can strive to perform good deeds and cultivate virtuous qualities, true goodness is an inherent attribute of God alone. It serves as a reminder of the divine nature and moral perfection of God, and it encourages believers to seek a deeper understanding of goodness that aligns with spiritual values.

This perspective invites reflection on humility, as it acknowledges human limitations and the need for divine guidance in the pursuit of moral excellence. Overall, the statement can be seen as a call to recognize the role of faith in the journey toward goodness and righteousness in our lives.
