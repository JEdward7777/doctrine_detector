  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the concept of a 'remnant' and how it reflects God's selective grace towards His people. The student effectively conveys the idea that God preserves a faithful group despite challenges and societal decline, showcasing His mercy and personal relationship with His people. The answer could be enhanced by incorporating more specific examples from scripture to strengthen the theological foundation of the argument. Overall, a well-developed response."
