The Bible speaks extensively about God's nature, especially in terms of compassion. Several passages convey the idea that God is inherently compassionate and loving. For example:

1. **Exodus 34:6-7** describes God as merciful and gracious, "slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness." This highlights the patience and kindness that God embodies.

2. **Psalm 103:8-14** articulates God's compassion, stating that He "is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love." It emphasizes that God understands human frailty and extends His compassion to humanity.

3. **Isaiah 49:15** uses the metaphor of a mother’s love, illustrating that God’s compassion is profoundly nurturing, suggesting that just as a mother cannot forget her child, God remembers and cares for His people.

4. **Luke 6:36** encourages followers to "be merciful, just as your Father is merciful," indicating not only God’s compassionate nature but also the expectation that humanity should emulate that compassion in their interactions with others.

These passages collectively portray God as a being characterized by deep compassion, demonstrating His care for creation and His desire for justice and mercy in human relationships. This understanding encourages a call to embody such compassion in our own lives, reflecting a commitment to empathy and kindness.
