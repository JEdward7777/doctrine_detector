The inclusion of specific verses, such as Exodus 34:6-7, Psalm 103:8-14, Isaiah 49:15, and Luke 6:36, effectively illustrates the depth of God's compassion and its impact on our understanding of divine love and mercy. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong grasp of how God's compassion influences our comprehension of divine attributes. Great job!"
