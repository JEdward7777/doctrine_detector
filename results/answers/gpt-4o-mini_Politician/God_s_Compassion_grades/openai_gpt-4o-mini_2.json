By citing specific verses and elaborating on their implications, the answer effectively demonstrates how God's compassionate nature shapes His interactions with humanity and sets a model for believers to follow. The only thing that could enhance this response further is perhaps delving deeper into the theological implications of God's compassion in the context of divine justice and forgiveness."
