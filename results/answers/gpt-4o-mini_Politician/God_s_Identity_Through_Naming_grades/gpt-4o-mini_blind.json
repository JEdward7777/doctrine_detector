  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of how the concept of being \"called by my name\" reflects our relationship with God, highlighting aspects of identity, purpose, and belonging. The explanation of the reciprocal nature of this relationship and how it can inspire individuals to live out their faith is well articulated. However, to improve the grade, the response could further emphasize the Christian perspective of being called by God, referencing biblical examples such as Abraham, Moses, or the disciples who were specifically called by name for a particular purpose in accordance with God's plan. Adding more scriptural references and theological depth would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
