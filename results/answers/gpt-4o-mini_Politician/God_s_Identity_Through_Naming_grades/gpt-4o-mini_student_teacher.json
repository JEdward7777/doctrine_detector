  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of how being \"called by my name\" reflects our relationship with God, touching on aspects of identity, purpose, belonging, and community. They articulate well how this concept can foster a sense of worth and significance, as well as the reciprocal nature of the relationship with God. However, the student's response could be improved by more explicitly tying these points back to the Christian perspective on identity and belonging to God. Emphasizing the unique personal relationship and ownership that comes with being called by God's name would strengthen the connection to the Christian worldview."
