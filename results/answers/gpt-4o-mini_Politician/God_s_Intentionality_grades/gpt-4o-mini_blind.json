However, it lacks explicit reference to Christian doctrine, scriptural foundations, or the unique understanding of calling within a Christian worldview. Drawing more specifically from biblical teachings on calling and God's sovereignty would enhance the doctrinal correctness and depth of the response. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the divine aspect of God's calling and His ultimate sovereignty in the process would align more closely with a Christian worldview."
