  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid overview of the Christian doctrine of justification, focusing on key elements such as faith, grace, repentance, the role of Jesus Christ, and assurance. The explanation is clear and covers essential aspects while maintaining doctrinal correctness. However, it could have been strengthened by including more explicit references to key biblical passages supporting the concept of justification by faith. Additionally, the student could have elaborated further on the imputed righteousness aspect of justification to enhance the theological depth of the response. Nonetheless, overall, a well-structured and informative answer."
