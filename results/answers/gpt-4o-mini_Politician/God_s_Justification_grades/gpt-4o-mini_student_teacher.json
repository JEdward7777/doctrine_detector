  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the Christian doctrine of justification, addressing the key components effectively. The response shows a good understanding of the concept and its significance in salvation. However, there is a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer in terms of emphasizing the role of repentance alongside faith in justification. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic and presents the information clearly."
