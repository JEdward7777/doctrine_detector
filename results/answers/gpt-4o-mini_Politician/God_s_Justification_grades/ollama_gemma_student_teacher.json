  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Christian doctrine of justification. It clearly articulates the central elements of the process, including the role of faith, grace, repentance, and the significance of Jesus Christ's sacrifice. The inclusion of a brief explanation regarding the importance of approaching these discussions with sensitivity is also commendable.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from greater clarity in expressing the connection between forgiveness of sins and declaring individuals to be righteous in God's sight. Additionally, the student's answer lacks specific reference to the act of forgiveness being central to God's justification of sinners."
