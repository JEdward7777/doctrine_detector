  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the Christian doctrine of justification, expanding on key elements such as faith, grace, repentance, the role of Jesus Christ, and assurance. It effectively clarifies the concept and its significance in salvation from a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps include more scriptural references to support the explanation further."
