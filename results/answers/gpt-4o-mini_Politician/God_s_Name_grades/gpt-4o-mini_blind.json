  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-rounded and accurate explanation of the significance of God's name 'Yahweh' in the Bible. They have touched upon important theological themes such as covenantal relationship, self-existence, revelation of character, sacredness, and theological implications. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the student could have delved deeper into the scriptural references and theological implications of the name 'Yahweh' to further bolster their argument. Overall, a solid response."
