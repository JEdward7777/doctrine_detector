  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a strong and comprehensive answer that thoroughly explores the significance of the term \"Almighty\" in relation to God's nature. The response effectively highlights key attributes such as omnipotence, sovereignty, and ultimate authority. However, the student could have linked these attributes more explicitly to the concern of understanding God's omnipotence as fundamental to faith and worship. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept within a Christian worldview."
