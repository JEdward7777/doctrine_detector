It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding God's omnipotence in relation to faith and worship. The only minor improvement could be to further emphasize the centrality of God's omnipotence in shaping one's belief and relationship with Him. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful response."
