However, it lacks a foundational emphasis on seeking God's will above personal desires and feelings. The Christian worldview would prioritize aligning one's plans with God's revealed will in Scripture and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit through prayer and submission. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of surrendering personal desires to God's sovereign will and following Christ's example. Additionally, the response could benefit from highlighting the need for discernment in distinguishing between personal inclinations and God's direction."
