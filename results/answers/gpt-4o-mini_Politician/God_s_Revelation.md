## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the Bible, God introduces Himself in various ways that reflect His nature and attributes. One of the most significant revelations of God's name occurs in Exodus 3:14, where God identifies Himself to Moses as "I AM WHO I AM." This name, often represented as Yahweh, emphasizes His eternal existence and unchanging nature.

Additionally, throughout the scriptures, God uses different names that highlight various aspects of His character. For example, in Genesis, He is referred to as Elohim, which denotes His power as the Creator. In Psalm 23, He is called Jehovah-Ra'ah, meaning "The Lord is my Shepherd," which conveys care and guidance.

These names and titles allow individuals to understand and relate to God in multifaceted ways, reflecting His sovereignty, love, and personal relationship with humanity. It's essential to approach these texts with respect for the diverse interpretations and beliefs that exist within the many religious traditions that engage with the Bible.
