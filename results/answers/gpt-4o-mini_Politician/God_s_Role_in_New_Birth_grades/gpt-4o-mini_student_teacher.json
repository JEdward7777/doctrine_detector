  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the concept of being \"born again\" and acknowledges God's role in initiating and facilitating this process. However, the answer falls short of emphasizing the crucial aspect of God's sovereignty and grace in the individual's salvation. It is important for the student to highlight that being born again is solely God's work and not achieved by human effort, as the reference answer states. The student's answer could be improved by explicitly stating the divine initiative and sovereignty in the process of spiritual rebirth."
