The response effectively conveys the idea that spiritual rebirth is a divine act, while also acknowledging the role of human choice and the variations in interpretation among faith traditions. The inclusion of a reference to divine initiative aligns well with the specified concern regarding God's sovereignty and grace in salvation."
