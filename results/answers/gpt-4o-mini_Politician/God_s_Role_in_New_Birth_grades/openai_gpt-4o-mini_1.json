The explanation provided demonstrates an understanding of the theological significance of God's role in bringing about new birth in individuals within a Christian framework. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to offer a more explicit reference to scriptural teachings or doctrinal principles supporting the concept of God's sovereign work in the process of salvation."
