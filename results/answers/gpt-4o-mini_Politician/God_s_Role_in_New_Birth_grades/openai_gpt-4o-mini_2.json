  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately conveys the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of spiritual rebirth, aligning well with the Christian view that new birth is a result of divine initiative rather than human effort. The explanation provided demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological perspective within Christianity. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more explicit references to biblical passages or key theological concepts to further strengthen the argument."
