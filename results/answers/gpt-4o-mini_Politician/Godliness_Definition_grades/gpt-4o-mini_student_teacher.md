## [Answer](../Godliness_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Bible speaks to the concept of 'godliness' in several passages, emphasizing a lifestyle that reflects reverence, respect, and devotion to God. In 1 Timothy 4:7-8, for example, the Apostle Paul encourages believers to train themselves in godliness, suggesting that it involves intentional effort and discipline, akin to physical exercise.

In general, godliness in the biblical context can be understood as living in a way that is consistent with God's character and will. This includes cultivating virtues such as love, kindness, humility, and integrity. Additionally, in 2 Peter 1:5-7, believers are encouraged to supplement their faith with virtues like knowledge, self-control, perseverance, and godliness itself, indicating that it is a fundamental quality to develop in one's spiritual journey.

Overall, godliness is portrayed as an embodiment of faith in action, where oneâ€™s conduct, choices, and relationships reflect a commitment to living according to God's principles and teachings. It's a holistic approach to life that not only focuses on personal piety but also on how one interacts with others and the world at large, promoting values that uplift and encourage a harmonious community.
