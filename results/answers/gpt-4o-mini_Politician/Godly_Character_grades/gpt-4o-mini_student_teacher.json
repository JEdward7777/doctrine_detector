  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate list of the fruits of the Holy Spirit from Galatians 5:22-23, demonstrating a solid understanding of the characteristics of a godly individual. However, the student included additional qualities beyond the reference answer which may show a deeper understanding but could potentially deviate from a strict adherence to the given list. Encouraging the student to focus on the key fruits mentioned in the reference answer would have strengthened their response within the specified concern."
