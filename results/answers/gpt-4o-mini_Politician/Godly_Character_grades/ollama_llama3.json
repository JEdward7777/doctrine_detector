However, it lacks comprehensive coverage of the other three fruits (goodness, faithfulness, and gentleness) that are also essential aspects of godly character. Nevertheless, the explanation of each fruit provides a solid foundation for cultivating these qualities in one's life, aligning well with the concern to understand the characteristics of a godly individual and how to cultivate them."
