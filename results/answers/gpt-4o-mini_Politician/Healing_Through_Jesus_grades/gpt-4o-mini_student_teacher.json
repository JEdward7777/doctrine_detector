  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer detailing Jesus's approach to healing demon-possessed individuals, emphasizing compassion, authority, inclusivity, holistic healing, and personal encounters. While the student did not explicitly mention the practice of 'casting out' demons as the reference answer did, their discussion effectively captured the essence of Jesus's authority over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. Overall, a strong understanding of the Christian worldview is demonstrated in the response."
