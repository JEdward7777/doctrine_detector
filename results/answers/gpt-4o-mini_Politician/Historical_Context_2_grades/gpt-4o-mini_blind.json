  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of why the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt, connecting it to the biblical account of their haste and the significance of this practice in the Jewish tradition. The student effectively highlights the cultural and historical context of the Exodus and the symbolism behind consuming unleavened bread. However, to enhance the grade, further elaboration on the spiritual significance of unleavened bread in terms of purity and obedience to God's commands could have been included."
