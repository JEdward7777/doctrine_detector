However, the student missed the key aspect of God's instruction as the reason for eating unleavened bread, which is central to the biblical account. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to recognize the divine intervention and guidance in shaping religious practices. The answer also lacked emphasis on the theological significance of God's deliverance of the Israelites from slavery."
