  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the historical context and religious significance of the Israelites' eating unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt. It effectively explains the hasty departure and its connection to the holiday of Passover. The student also connects the practice to the broader themes of endurance and cultural continuity. While the response lacks the direct mention of God's instruction, it provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation from a Christian perspective."
