## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a significant historical and cultural practice that is rooted in the context of their Exodus. According to biblical accounts, they left in such haste that there was no time to allow the bread to rise, which is why they baked unleavened bread instead. This event is commemorated during the Jewish holiday of Passover, symbolizing both their flight from slavery and the importance of readiness and faith in moments of urgency. Eating unleavened bread serves as a reminder of their journey to freedom and the endurance of their culture and traditions throughout history.
