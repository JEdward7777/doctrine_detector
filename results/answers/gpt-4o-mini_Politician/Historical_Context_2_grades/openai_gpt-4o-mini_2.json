It emphasizes the significance of this practice within the context of the Exodus story and highlights the cultural and symbolic importance of eating unleavened bread during the Jewish holiday of Passover. However, it could have provided a bit more emphasis on the role of God's instruction in shaping this religious practice, as mentioned in the given answer."
