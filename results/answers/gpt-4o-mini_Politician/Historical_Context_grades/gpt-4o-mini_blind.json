It connects these events well with the overarching theme of a faithful minority amidst unfaithfulness. The inclusion of the story of Elijah, though not directly from Isaiah or Amos, adds depth to the discussion. However, the answer could have been strengthened by further emphasizing the theological significance of the remnant concept within the context of God's redemptive plan and covenantal faithfulness."
