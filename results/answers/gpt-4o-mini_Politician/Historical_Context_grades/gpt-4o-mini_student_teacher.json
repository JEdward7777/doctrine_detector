  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-supported answer referencing specific biblical events and passages from Isaiah and Amos that illustrate the concept of 'remnant.' They effectively explained how these events reflect the idea of a faithful minority amid unfaithfulness in society. The answer effectively connects the remnant concept to the historical significance in relation to God's promises. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the biblical events that illustrate the concept of 'remnant.' Overall, a strong understanding of the concept was demonstrated."
