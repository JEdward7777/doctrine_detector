They provide well-articulated examples from the texts, clearly explaining how these events illustrate the idea of a faithful minority remaining true to God. The inclusion of the story of Elijah further strengthens the student's argument. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a closer analysis of the historical context and theological significance of each event in relation to the concept of the remnant. Additionally, the connection to the teacher's reference answer regarding Isaiah and Amos could be elaborated on."
