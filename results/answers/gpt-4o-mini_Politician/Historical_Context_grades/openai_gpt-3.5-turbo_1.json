It effectively addressed the concern by highlighting the historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises, emphasizing the preservation of a faithful minority despite judgment and exile. The inclusion of additional biblical references, such as the story of Elijah, further supported the explanation. The response could have been strengthened by connecting the concept of the remnant to the broader theological implications of God's faithfulness to His covenant throughout history."
