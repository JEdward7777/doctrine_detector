# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The concept of the 'remnant' is an important theme in the prophetic books of Isaiah and Amos. It refers to a faithful minority of people who remain true to God amid widespread unfaithfulness and societal decay. Here are a few biblical events and passages that illustrate this concept:

1. **The Assyrian Invasion (Isaiah 10:20-22)**: Isaiah prophesies that after the judgment of God on Israel through the Assyrian invasion, a remnant of Israel will return. This remnant will be a faithful group that relies on the Lord rather than on worldly alliances or power.

2. **The Promise of a Holy Seed (Isaiah 6:13)**: In the vision of Isaiah, God tells him that although the people will be hardened and face judgment, a holy seed or remnant will remain. This remnant symbolizes hope and preservation of a faithful community that will restore God's covenantal relationship.

3. **The Call to Justice (Amos 5:15)**: In the book of Amos, the prophet calls for justice and righteousness among the people of Israel. He emphasizes that the faithful who seek justice will be part of a remnant that will survive the impending judgment on the nation due to its social injustices.

4. **The Restoration of Israel (Amos 9:11-15)**: Despite the bleak outlook in Amos, there is a promise of restoration for the remnant of Israel. The passage proclaims that God will raise up the fallen booth of David and restore its ruins, indicating a future hope for those who remain faithful.

5. **Elijah and the Seven Thousand (1 Kings 19:18)**: Though not from Isaiah or Amos directly, the story of Elijah showcases the remnant concept, where God reassures Elijah that He has preserved a remnant of seven thousand in Israel who have not bowed to Baal. This highlights the presence of faithful followers even when the larger community strays.

The concept of the remnant serves as a powerful reminder that God always preserves a faithful group, providing hope and continuity of worship and obedience amid challenges and trials.
