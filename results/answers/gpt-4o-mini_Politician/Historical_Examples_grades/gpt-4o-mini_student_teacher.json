  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-detailed response, identifying and explaining various examples of individuals who built altars in the Bible and the significance of those acts. The examples chosen were relevant and supported by biblical references. The student effectively demonstrated how these acts of building altars reflected faith, gratitude, and commitment to God. However, the response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern provided in a more explicit manner to show a clear connection between the historical examples and how they can inspire Christians in their worship practices."
