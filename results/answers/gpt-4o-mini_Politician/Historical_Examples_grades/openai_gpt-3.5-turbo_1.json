The given examples effectively demonstrate how building altars served as expressions of faith, gratitude, and commitment to God. The response effectively addresses the concern by showcasing how learning about these historical examples can inspire Christians to express their faith and devotion through intentional acts of worship. The only area for improvement would be to expand slightly on the connection between the examples and how they specifically inspire Christians today. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
