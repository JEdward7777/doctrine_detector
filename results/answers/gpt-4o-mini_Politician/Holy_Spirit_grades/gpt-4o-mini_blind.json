However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the unique Christian understanding of the Holy Spirit as a distinct person within the Trinity. The response could be improved by stressing the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Triune Godhead, distinct from mere general spirituality or inspiration. Further development on the biblical basis for the Holy Spirit's identity and role would strengthen the answer."
