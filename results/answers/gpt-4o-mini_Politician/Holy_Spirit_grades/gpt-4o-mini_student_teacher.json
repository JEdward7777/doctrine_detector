It is important to ensure that the distinctiveness of the Holy Spirit's identity within the Trinity is communicated clearly to prevent misconceptions. Additionally, more explicit teaching on the biblical basis and theological significance of the Holy Spirit as part of the Triune God would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
