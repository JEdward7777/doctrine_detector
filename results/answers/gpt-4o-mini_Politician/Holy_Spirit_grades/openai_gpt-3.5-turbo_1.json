While the suggested approach is thoughtful and inclusive, it may benefit from a more direct emphasis on the Holy Spirit as a distinct person within the Trinity, to clearly communicate His identity and work from a Christian perspective. Incorporating more explicit biblical references to support the teaching could enhance the response even further."
