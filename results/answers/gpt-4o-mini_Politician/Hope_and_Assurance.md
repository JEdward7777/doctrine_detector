## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The concept of hope is significant in biblical references, often seen as a cornerstone of faith and resilience. In many scriptures, hope is portrayed as a source of strength and encouragement, providing comfort in difficult times. For example, Romans 15:13 states, "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."

Conversely, the absence of hope can be described in some biblical contexts as a source of despair. For instance, Proverbs 13:12 notes, "Hope deferred makes the heart sick." This highlights the emotional and spiritual toll that can arise when individuals feel that hope is lacking. In such scriptures, the importance of hope is emphasized, advocating for maintaining faith and trust even in challenging circumstances.

Ultimately, hope is presented not only as a personal virtue but also as an essential aspect of communal and spiritual life, encouraging individuals to foster hope in themselves and others.
