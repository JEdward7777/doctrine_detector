The explanation of how the term can refer to heavenly beings, creation, and God's sovereignty aligns well with Christian beliefs. It effectively addresses the concern by linking the understanding of spiritual warfare and divine authority to a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific biblical examples to further strengthen the argument."
