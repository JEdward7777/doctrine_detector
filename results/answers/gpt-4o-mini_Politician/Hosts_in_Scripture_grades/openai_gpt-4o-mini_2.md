In scripture, particularly within the Judeo-Christian tradition, the term "hosts" primarily refers to heavenly beings or angelic figures, often associated with armies or multitudes. This term is frequently found in connection with the phrase "Lord of hosts," which signifies God's sovereignty over all divine beings and the heavenly realm.

1. **Heavenly Armies**: The term "hosts" can signify the armies of angels that serve God. This usage reflects the idea of divine power and protection, portraying God as a commander of these celestial beings.

2. **Creation**: In some contexts, "hosts" can also refer to all created beings in the heavens and on earth, encompassing everything from the stars and celestial bodies to the array of life on the planet.

3. **Religious and Literary Contexts**: The term is often used in prayers, hymns, and liturgical contexts, where worshippers express reverence for God's majesty and authority over all creation.

In summary, "hosts" in scripture typically encompasses angelic beings and can extend to refer to the entirety of creation under divine authority. This reflects a rich theological tradition that emphasizes God's omnipotence and the majesty of the spiritual realm.
