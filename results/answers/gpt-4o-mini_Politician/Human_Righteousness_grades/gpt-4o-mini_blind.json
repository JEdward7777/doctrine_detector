  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: The response provides a solid overview of how a person can be declared righteous according to the Christian faith. It correctly emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus Christ, grace, repentance, the role of Scripture, and the transformative process. The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian doctrine. However, to achieve a higher grade, the student could have delved deeper into the concept of justification by faith alone and could have provided more scriptural references to support their points. Overall, a strong and well-rounded answer."
