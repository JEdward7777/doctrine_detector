## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the Christian faith, being declared righteous is often understood through the concept of justification. This process typically involves a few key elements:

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: Central to Christian belief is the idea that faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior is essential. Christians believe that through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus offers redemption and reconciliation with God.

2. **Grace**: Righteousness is seen as a gift from God, known as grace. This means that individuals cannot earn righteousness through their own actions but receive it through God’s unmerited favor.

3. **Repentance**: Acknowledging one’s sins and turning away from them is also crucial. Repentance signifies a desire to change one's life and align it with God’s teachings.

4. **The Role of Scripture**: Many Christians refer to biblical passages, particularly in the New Testament, such as Romans 3:22-24 and Ephesians 2:8-9, which communicate that righteousness comes through faith and not by works alone.

5. **The Transformative Process**: While being declared righteous occurs through faith, many Christians view the journey of growing in righteousness as a lifelong process, aided by the Holy Spirit, which involves developing moral character and goodwill.

Overall, this understanding emphasizes a loving, inclusive relationship with God, inviting all to participate in this journey of faith, grace, and transformation.
