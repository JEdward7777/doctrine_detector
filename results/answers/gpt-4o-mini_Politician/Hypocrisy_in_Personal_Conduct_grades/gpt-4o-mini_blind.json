The steps outlined are logical and applicable in daily life. However, from a Christian worldview, there is a notable absence of reference to the role of faith and reliance on God's grace in aligning actions with beliefs. Emphasizing the importance of prayer, seeking guidance from Scripture, and depending on the Holy Spirit to empower obedience to God's Word would have enhanced the depth and completeness of the answer within a Christian perspective."
