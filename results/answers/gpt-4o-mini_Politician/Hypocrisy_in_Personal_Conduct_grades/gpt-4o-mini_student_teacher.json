  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful list of practical steps to ensure actions align with beliefs, emphasizing transparency, self-assessment, and leading by example. However, the student's answer lacks a direct connection to seeking God's guidance through prayer and living authentically according to His Word as the reference answer highlighted. To fully align with a Christian worldview, it is essential to acknowledge the importance of spiritual reflection and guidance in keeping actions consistent with beliefs. The student's response could be enhanced by incorporating more explicit references to aligning actions with biblical principles and seeking God's wisdom in daily decision-making."
