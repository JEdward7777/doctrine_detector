  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: \nThe answer provides a thoughtful interpretation of the phrase \"I have called you by name\" from a theological perspective, emphasizing the personal and relational aspect of God's recognition of individuals. The response effectively conveys the significance of being known and valued by God, as well as the implications for one's sense of belonging and purpose. However, it falls short in explicitly emphasizing the Christian doctrine of God's intimate knowledge and calling of believers by name, which is often associated with salvation, adoption into God's family, and a personal relationship with Him through Jesus Christ. To improve the grade, the student could further highlight the biblical foundations and implications of being called by God, specifically within the Christian tradition."
