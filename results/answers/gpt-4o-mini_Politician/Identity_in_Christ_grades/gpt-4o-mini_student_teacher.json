  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and thoughtful interpretation of the phrase \"I have called you by name\" from a theological perspective. They effectively convey the idea of God's personal recognition and value for each individual. The response also touches on the implications for understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ, highlighting the importance of connection with God. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly linking the concept of being called by name to the significance of identity and value in Christ, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
