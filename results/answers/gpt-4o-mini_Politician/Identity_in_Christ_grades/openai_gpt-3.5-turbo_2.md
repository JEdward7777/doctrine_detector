When interpreting the phrase "I have called you by name" from a theological perspective, it can be understood as a deeply personal and relational statement from God. It suggests that each individual is uniquely recognized and valued by God. This affirmation can convey a sense of belonging, purpose, and individual significance, emphasizing that God is aware of each person's journey and experiences.

From a broader context, this phrase encourages a sense of connection and intimacy with the divine, highlighting the importance of individuals in the fabric of humanity.
