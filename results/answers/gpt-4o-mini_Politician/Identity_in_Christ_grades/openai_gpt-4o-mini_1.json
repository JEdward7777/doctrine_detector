  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and insightful interpretation of the phrase \"I have called you by name\" from a theological perspective, emphasizing the personal and relational aspect of God's recognition and value of each individual. It also effectively addresses the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ by highlighting the significance of God's personal relationship with each person. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly tying the interpretation back to the answer provided and emphasizing the Christian perspective more explicitly."
