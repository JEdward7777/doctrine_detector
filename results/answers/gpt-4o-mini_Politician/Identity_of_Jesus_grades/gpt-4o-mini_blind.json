However, the response could be improved by emphasizing Jesus' unique role as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity, as central doctrines in Christian theology. Additionally, a clearer distinction could be made between the Christian perspective on Jesus and the beliefs of other religions, in line with a more doctrinally specific approach."
