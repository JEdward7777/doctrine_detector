  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: \nThe student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that explains the consequences of idolatry among God's people from a biblical perspective. The student effectively references both Old and New Testament examples to support their points. The answer appropriately emphasizes the themes of loss of divine favor, exile, spiritual consequences, and God's desire for restoration, all of which are key aspects of the biblical teachings on idolatry. However, the response could have been strengthened by providing more specific scriptural references to support each point and by delving deeper into the theological implications of idolatry in light of Christian doctrine. Nonetheless, it is a solid response overall."
