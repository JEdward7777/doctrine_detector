  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how the Bible illustrates the consequences of idolatry among God's people, drawing references from both the Old and New Testaments. They have effectively highlighted the loss of divine favor, exile and captivity, spiritual consequences, and God's desire for restoration in response to idolatry. The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and effectively conveyed the seriousness of straying from God's commandments. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the aspect of punishment and oppression as consequences of idolatry, as emphasized in the reference answer."
