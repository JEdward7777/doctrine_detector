It effectively addresses the concern by exploring how the conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders sheds light on broader themes relevant to contemporary faith. However, the response could have further emphasized the spiritual implications of the conflict and the need for genuine humility and devotion to God, drawing stronger connections to Christian teachings on pride, self-interest, and true faith."
