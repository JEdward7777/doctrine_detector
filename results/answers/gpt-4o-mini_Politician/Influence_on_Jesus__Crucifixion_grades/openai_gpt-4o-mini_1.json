The explanation incorporates biblical context and theological insight from a Christian worldview. The response effectively connects the historical events to contemporary faith by highlighting themes of power, ethical implications, and the complexities of religious leadership. However, there could have been more direct references to specific biblical passages or teachings to strengthen the Christian perspective further."
