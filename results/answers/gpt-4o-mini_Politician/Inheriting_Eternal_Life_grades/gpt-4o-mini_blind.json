However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly stating that according to Christian doctrine, salvation and eternal life come only through faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Additionally, a clearer emphasis on the sacrificial work of Jesus on the cross for the forgiveness of sins would have aligned more closely with orthodox Christian beliefs on this topic. The mention of different denominational interpretations was relevant but could have been better framed within the context of core Christian teachings on salvation."
