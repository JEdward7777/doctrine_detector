According to the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the concept of inheriting eternal life is often discussed in the context of faith and actions. In the Gospel of Matthew, for instance, Jesus speaks to a rich young ruler about keeping the commandments and following Him, which highlights the importance of both ethical living and faith. Additionally, passages such as John 3:16 emphasize believing in Jesus as essential for eternal life. 

Overall, the teachings suggest that a combination of faith in God, love for others, and adherence to moral principles is key to inheriting eternal life. Each interpretation may vary among different Christian denominations, so it's always beneficial to consider the wide range of theological perspectives within Christianity.

Grade: 70

Comments: The answer provided a general overview of the concept of inheriting eternal life according to the New Testament, referencing key passages such as the interaction with the rich young ruler in Matthew and John 3:16. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly stating that according to Christian doctrine, salvation and eternal life come only through faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Additionally, a clearer emphasis on the sacrificial work of Jesus on the cross for the forgiveness of sins would have aligned more closely with orthodox Christian beliefs on this topic. The mention of different denominational interpretations was relevant but could have been better framed within the context of core Christian teachings on salvation.
