According to the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, the concept of inheriting eternal life is often discussed in the context of faith and actions. In the Gospel of Matthew, for instance, Jesus speaks to a rich young ruler about keeping the commandments and following Him, which highlights the importance of both ethical living and faith. Additionally, passages such as John 3:16 emphasize believing in Jesus as essential for eternal life.
