  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of how following the teachings of Jesus is essential for inheriting eternal life, as exemplified in the interaction with the expert in Jewish law. It accurately reflects the concern of clarifying the path to salvation as taught by Jesus. The reference to different passages in the New Testament, such as the Gospel of Matthew and John 3:16, adds depth to the analysis. The only improvement could be to provide more specific references and elaboration on how faith, love for others, and moral principles play into inheriting eternal life according to Jesus' teachings."
