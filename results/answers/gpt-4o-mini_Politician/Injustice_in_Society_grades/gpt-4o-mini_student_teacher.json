  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of examples of injustice in our world today and offered a thoughtful response on how Christians can respond to these injustices. The answer aligns well with the concern of promoting fairness based on biblical principles. However, the student could enhance their answer by explicitly tying each example of injustice to specific biblical principles or teachings that support addressing those issues."
