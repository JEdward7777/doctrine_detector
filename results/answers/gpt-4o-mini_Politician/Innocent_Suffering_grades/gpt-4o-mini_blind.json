  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of \"innocent blood\" in the Bible and its implications for the value of life. The student effectively references both the Old Testament and New Testament to support their points, highlighting the importance of justice, mercy, and the sanctity of life. The response could be strengthened by providing more specific biblical examples and delving deeper into theological implications, but overall, it presents a thoughtful and well-reasoned analysis from a Christian worldview."
