  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the concept of \"innocent blood\" in the Bible, connecting it well to themes of justice, righteousness, and the value of life. The response effectively addressed the concern by delving into moral implications and societal treatment of individuals. The student's integration of biblical references and discussions on justice and mercy align well with a Christian worldview. However, a slightly higher grade could be achieved by directly aligning the response more closely with the succinct reference answer provided by emphasizing the sanctity of life and the injustice of wrongful death more explicitly."
