  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of the concept of \"the last day\" in Christian teaching. The student accurately describes it as the end of the current age, Christ's return, final judgment, resurrection of the dead, and the establishment of God's Kingdom. The response appropriately highlights the importance and various interpretations of this event within Christian denominations. To improve, the student could have included references to key biblical passages, such as those in the book of Revelation, which further elaborate on the events of the last day."
