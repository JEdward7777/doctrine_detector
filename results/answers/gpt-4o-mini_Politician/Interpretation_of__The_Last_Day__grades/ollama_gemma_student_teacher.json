It accurately describes the end of the current age as the primary connotation, highlighting Christ's return, resurrection, and the establishment of God's Kingdom. The student also acknowledges the variations in interpretation among denominations and theological perspectives, demonstrating awareness of the nuanced understanding of this concept within Christianity. While the answer aligns well with the provided reference answer, it lacks additional elaboration on the aspect of judgment, which is specifically mentioned in the concern."
