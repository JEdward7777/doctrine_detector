However, there is room for improvement in addressing the concern raised, as the response does not explicitly touch upon the crucial aspect of judgment for one's relationship with God and the urgency of faith. Making a direct connection between the concept of \"the last day\" and the implications for individuals in terms of judgment and faith would enhance the response."
