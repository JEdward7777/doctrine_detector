  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The answer provides a decent overview of how \"divine glory\" can be understood in the context of worship, emphasizing themes of transcendence, community, personal transformation, and cultural expressions. However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the Christian perspective specifically. To improve the grade, the student could have incorporated references to Biblical passages (such as Isaiah 6:3 or Revelation 4:11) that highlight the concept of divine glory in Christian worship. Additionally, delving deeper into the sacrificial aspect of worship and the centrality of Jesus Christ in bringing glory to God would have strengthened the response."
