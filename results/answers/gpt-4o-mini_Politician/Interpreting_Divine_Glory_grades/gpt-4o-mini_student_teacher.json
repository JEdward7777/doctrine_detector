  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful and well-articulated perspective on how \"divine glory\" can be understood in the context of worship, highlighting important aspects such as transcendence, community inspiration, personal transformation, and cultural expressions. However, the student's explanation leans more towards a general understanding of divine glory rather than specifically addressing the importance of recognizing God's glory in influencing worship practices. The student effectively explores the concept of divine glory in worship, but could benefit from further emphasizing the centrality of God's presence and deserving adoration as per the reference answer."
