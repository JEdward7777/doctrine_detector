The response effectively elaborates on the implications of divine glory for worshippers in terms of transcendence, community, personal transformation, and cultural expressions. However, the student could have further emphasized the unique Christian perspective on divine glory and how it specifically influences worship practices within Christianity. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of the concept and its importance in fostering a deeper connection with the divine."
