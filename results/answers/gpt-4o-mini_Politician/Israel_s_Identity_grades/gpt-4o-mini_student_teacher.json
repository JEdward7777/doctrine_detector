  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the name 'Israel' in biblical context, highlighting its roots in Jacob's wrestling with God and its broader implications for the Jewish people. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more specifically on the direct meaning of the name 'Israel' as \"He struggles with God,\" as given by God to Jacob in the reference answer. Additionally, incorporating more scriptural references could strengthen the biblical foundation of the explanation."
