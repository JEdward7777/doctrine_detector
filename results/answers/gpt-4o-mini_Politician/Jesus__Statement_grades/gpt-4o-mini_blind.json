The student effectively connects this statement to biblical teachings and conveys the importance of faith and spiritual renewal. However, the explanation could be enhanced by emphasizing the centrality of Jesus as the source of resurrection and eternal life for believers, rooted in his divine nature and sacrificial death for the forgiveness of sins. Additionally, a clearer distinction between spiritual renewal in the present life and the promise of life after physical death would strengthen the theological depth of the response."
