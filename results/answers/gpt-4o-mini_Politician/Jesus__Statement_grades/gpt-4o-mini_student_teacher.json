However, there is room for improvement in clarifying Jesus' unique identity and role as the source of resurrection. It is important to emphasize Jesus as the divine Son of God who has the power to physically and spiritually raise the dead, underscoring his unique position as the source of life and resurrection. Encouraging deeper exploration into the theological implications of Jesus' statement would enhance the theological understanding of this concept."
