  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" by emphasizing that Jesus is the source of resurrection and the one who brings people back to life spiritually. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, contributing to a deeper understanding of Christian faith and theology. The response could have further elaborated on the significance of Jesus as the source of eternal life and how this impacts believers' relationship with Him, earning a slightly lower grade."
