  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation on how Jesus used the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings, highlighting its significance in affirming the truth and authority of His statements. The response effectively connects the use of 'amen' to reinforcing the importance and weight of Jesus' words. However, the student could have better emphasized the aspect of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, as the reference answer focuses on this specific concern. Further integration of this Christian worldview perspective would have strengthened the overall response."
