  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of Jesus as the High Priest and His role in relation to the sacrifices made by human priests. It correctly highlights the superiority of Jesus' sacrifice over the sacrifices of the old covenant. The answer effectively conveys the significance of Jesus as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity. The student could enhance the answer by incorporating specific Scripture references from the Book of Hebrews to strengthen the theological points made. Additionally, emphasizing the doctrinal importance of Jesus being both fully God and fully man in His role as the High Priest would further deepen the theological analysis. Overall, a strong response with room for further theological depth."
