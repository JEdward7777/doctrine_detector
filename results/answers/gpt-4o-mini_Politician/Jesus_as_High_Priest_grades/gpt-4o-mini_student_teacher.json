  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the significance of Jesus as the High Priest in Christian theology. They effectively discussed how Jesus' role transcends the traditional priesthood and the implications for sacrifices made by human priests. The answer demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic, but could have been strengthened by directly quoting or referencing relevant biblical passages, such as Hebrews 4:14-16, to further support their points. Overall, a well-written response that effectively addresses the concern."
