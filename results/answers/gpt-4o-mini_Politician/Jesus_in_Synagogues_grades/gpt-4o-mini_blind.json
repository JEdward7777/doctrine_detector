However, there are some doctrinal points that could be further emphasized or clarified. For example, the significance of Jesus' identity as the Messiah and Son of God could be brought out more distinctly in relation to His actions in the synagogue. Additionally, the mention of conflicts with religious authorities could be expanded upon to show how these interactions were rooted in deeper theological disagreements. Overall, a solid response but with room for deeper theological reflection."
