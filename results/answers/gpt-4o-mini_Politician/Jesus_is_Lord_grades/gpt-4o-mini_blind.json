However, there are areas for improvement. The suggestions focus more on being sensitive to the political context rather than emphasizing the unique and doctrinally significant assertion of Jesus' lordship. The answer could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the exclusive claims of Christ as Lord in Christianity, while still being respectful and considerate of the surrounding context. Additional references to Scripture or doctrinal teachings could strengthen the response."
