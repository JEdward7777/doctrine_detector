  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant suggestions on how to communicate the phrase 'Jesus is Lord' in a context where political leaders are also referred to as 'lord.' They emphasized clarity and sensitivity, which are important considerations. However, the student could improve by directly addressing the concern of differentiating Jesus' divine lordship from earthly titles. The reference answer clearly defines the significance of 'Jesus is Lord' in terms of His divine authority, which the student could have integrated more explicitly into their response."
