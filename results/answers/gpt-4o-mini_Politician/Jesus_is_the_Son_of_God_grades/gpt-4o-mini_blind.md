## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

In a Muslim context, it's important to honor and respect the beliefs of Islam while engaging in interfaith dialogue. Muslims view Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) as one of the great prophets, but they do not accept the concept of him being the Son of God. 

A respectful translation or adaptation might be: "Jesus is regarded as a revered prophet in Islam." This phrasing captures the esteem in which Jesus is held while aligning with Islamic beliefs. It's essential to approach such discussions with sensitivity and an openness to understanding different perspectives.

70.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this response a 70.

While the answer shows an attempt to respect Islamic beliefs and engage in interfaith dialogue, it falls short in accurately representing the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God. In a Christian worldview, Jesus being the Son of God is a non-negotiable doctrinal truth, not simply a matter of perception or interpretation. The response could have acknowledged this difference in a more direct and clear manner, while still discussing the parallel belief in Jesus as a revered figure in Islam. The emphasis should have been on the importance of understanding and respecting the differing beliefs rather than watering down the Christian doctrine.
