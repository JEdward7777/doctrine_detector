However, the concern here is about maintaining Biblical accuracy and explaining the original text's meaning clearly. The suggested adaptation falls short in accurately conveying the original meaning that Jesus is the Son of God. In an interfaith dialogue, it is crucial to maintain the core teachings while promoting understanding, and in this case, a clearer explanation or context could have been provided to bridge the theological differences between Christianity and Islam."
