  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the importance of maintaining Biblically accurate language, which aligns with the concern about explaining the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way. It also shows sensitivity to the Muslim perspective by using language that is respectful and culturally aware.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more explicit teaching and context on the meaning of \"Jesus is the Son of God\" rather than simply translating it into a phrase that aligns with Islamic beliefs. While the goal is to minimize offense, it's also important to ensure that the translation accurately conveys the Christian message.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern and shows sensitivity to different perspectives, but could be strengthened by providing more explicit teaching on the biblical concept being translated."
