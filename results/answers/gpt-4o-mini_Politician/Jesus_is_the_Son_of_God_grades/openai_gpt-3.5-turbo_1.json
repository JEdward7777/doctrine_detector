However, there is room for improvement in addressing the concern as the provided response suggests honoring and respecting Islamic beliefs without affirming the central Christian belief that Jesus is the Son of God. A more robust explanation of the concept of Jesus as the Son of God within the Christian faith could have been included to align with a Christian-specific worldview."
