  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response adequately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain the meaning of \"Jesus is the Son of God.\" However, the suggested response in the context of Islam focuses more on respectful adaptation and translation rather than ensuring Biblical accuracy. More emphasis on accurately conveying the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God within an interfaith dialogue context would improve the grade."
