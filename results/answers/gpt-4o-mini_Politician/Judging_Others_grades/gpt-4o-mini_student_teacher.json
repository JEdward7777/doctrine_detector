  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched response, incorporating various biblical passages and principles related to judgment within the Christian community. The answer demonstrated an understanding of the importance of approaching judgment with sensitivity, humility, and love. However, the response could be improved by focusing more directly on the given reference answer, which emphasizes the importance of not judging harshly or condemning one another. The student's answer touched on this point but could have been more aligned with the specific instructions provided in the reference answer. Overall, a solid effort with room for a bit more direct alignment with the given reference."
