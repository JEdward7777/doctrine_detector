The answer could be enhanced by incorporating specific biblical references to support each point and by emphasizing the centrality of Christ's sacrifice for salvation throughout. Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify that salvation is by grace through faith alone, and works are a demonstration of that faith rather than a means of earning salvation. Overall, a strong foundation is presented with room for deeper theological exploration."
