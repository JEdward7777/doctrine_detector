  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the biblical perspective on judgment, encompassing various aspects like faith, deeds, intentions, the Book of Life, and the distinction between believers and non-believers. It emphasizes the importance of aligning one's actions with biblical principles and the righteous character of Christ. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of considering one's actions in light of biblical teachings. However, to enhance the grade, more direct reference to the alignment of actions with Christ's righteousness could have been incorporated throughout the response."
