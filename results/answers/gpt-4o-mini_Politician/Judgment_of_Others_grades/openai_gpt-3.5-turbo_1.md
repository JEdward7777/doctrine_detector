# Question [Judgment of Others](../../../questions/Judgment_of_Others.md)
What does Jesus teach us about pointing out the faults of others in relation to our own faults?

# Correct Answer
Jesus teaches us to first remove the plank from our own eye before pointing out the speck in someone else's eye, reminding us to practice humility and self-reflection (Luke 6:41-42).

# Stated Concern
Criticizing others while ignoring our own faults can reflect hypocrisy and diminish our witness as Christians.

# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Jesus' teachings emphasize the importance of self-reflection and humility when addressing the faults of others. A well-known passage from the Gospel of Matthew, specifically Matthew 7:3-5, illustrates this point: “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.” 

This passage encourages us to focus on our own imperfections before commenting on the shortcomings of others. It highlights the importance of compassion, understanding, and recognizing our common humanity. By prioritizing introspection and personal growth, we are better equipped to support others in a constructive and empathetic manner.

In a broader sense, Jesus' teachings promote a spirit of kindness, forgiveness, and grace. They encourage us to engage in dialogue and correction with love and humility, rather than judgment, fostering an atmosphere of mutual support and understanding. This approach not only honors the dignity of others but also nurtures our own personal development.
