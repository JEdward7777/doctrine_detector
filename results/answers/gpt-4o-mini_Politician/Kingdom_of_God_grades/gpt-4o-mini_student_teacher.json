  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer shows a good understanding of the importance of cultural context in translation work and the need to ensure effective communication of spiritual concepts. However, the concern raised about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' is not directly addressed in the response. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes retaining the original term and providing explanations about its spiritual significance, which the student's answer does not fully align with. Overall, while the student provides valid points, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern raised."
