  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response appropriately recognizes the concern that rephrasing the term \"Kingdom of God\" could potentially lead to a loss of depth and biblical context. However, it also presents valid points about considering cultural nuances and linguistic traditions when translating. While engaging with local leaders and scholars is beneficial, it may not fully address the concern raised about retaining the spiritual and eschatological significance of the original term. Overall, the response shows a balanced consideration of the issue at hand."
