However, the suggestion to provide explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance is not explicitly supported in the given response. While the response highlights the importance of respecting cultural nuances, it lacks a strong affirmation of the spiritual and theological implications of retaining the original phrase. Strengthening the connection between retaining the term and its biblical significance would enhance the overall response."
