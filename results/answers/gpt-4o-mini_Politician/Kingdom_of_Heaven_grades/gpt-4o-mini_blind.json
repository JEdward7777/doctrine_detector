  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-rounded explanation of the importance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the book of Matthew. It effectively discusses theological significance, cultural context, symbolism, inclusivity of belief, and preservation of tradition. The answer is thorough and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, it could have been strengthened by incorporating more specific biblical references and quotes from the text to support the points made. Overall, a solid response."
