  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-reasoned answer, demonstrating an in-depth understanding of the theological, cultural, and symbolic significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the book of Matthew. The response effectively connects the theological implications and cultural context, highlighting the importance of this term in conveying the intended messages of the biblical author. However, the answer could be improved by directly acknowledging the distinctiveness of the term to Matthew's gospel, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
