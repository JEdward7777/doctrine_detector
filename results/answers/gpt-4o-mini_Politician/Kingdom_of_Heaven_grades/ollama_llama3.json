  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of using \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in Matthew's Gospel, discussing various theological, cultural, and symbolic implications. The writer provides clear explanations for each point, making their argument stronger.\n\nHowever, the response could have been even more effective if it had directly addressed the concern about understanding unique terminology used in the gospels. While the writer does touch on this aspect by highlighting the phrase's distinctiveness to Matthew's gospel, a more explicit connection between the term \"heaven\" and its intended message would have strengthened their argument.\n\nThe response also lacks specific examples or biblical references to support some of its claims, which could make it harder for readers to fully grasp the author's points. Nevertheless, the writer provides a clear and concise overview of the importance of retaining \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven.\""
