  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the theological and cultural significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the book of Matthew. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the unique terminology in the gospels for grasping the intended messages of the biblical authors. The response is well-supported with relevant points and demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview."
