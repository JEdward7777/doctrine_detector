## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

The response accurately states that "the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew", which aligns with the given answer. Additionally, it provides a helpful clarification about Aramaic being used in certain books, which demonstrates an understanding of the linguistic context of the Old Testament.

However, I would deduct some points because the response does not fully explore the significance of this knowledge for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context. While the concern is mentioned, the response could be more explicit about how this knowledge is essential for grasping the meaning and relevance of the Old Testament.

Comment: The response provides a good foundation by accurately stating the language in which most of the Old Testament was written. To take it to the next level, consider adding a sentence or two that highlights the importance of understanding the original languages for studying the Scriptures and applying their teachings to our lives today.
