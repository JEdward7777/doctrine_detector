Comment: The response appropriately acknowledges that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is essential for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context. It provides correct and relevant information regarding the languages used in the Old Testament. The slight deduction is due to not explicitly mentioning the portions in Aramaic found in the books of Daniel and Ezra, which could have further enriched the response.
