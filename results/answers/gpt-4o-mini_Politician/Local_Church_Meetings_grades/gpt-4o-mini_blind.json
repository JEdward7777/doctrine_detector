However, from a Christian worldview, it lacks specific references to the biblical foundation of the early church gatherings, such as meeting in homes (Acts 2:46), breaking of bread (Acts 2:42), and studying the apostles' teaching (Acts 2:42). Including more Scriptural references and emphasizing the importance of gathering in the name of Jesus Christ would strengthen the answer from a Christian perspective."
