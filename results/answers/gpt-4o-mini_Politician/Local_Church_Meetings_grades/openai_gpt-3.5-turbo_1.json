It aligns well with the concern by highlighting the intimate and communal aspect of these gatherings, which can strengthen relationships and build a sense of community among believers. However, it could have elaborated further on additional activities and ways to support and encourage one another in faith, which could enhance the response even more from a Christian perspective."
