  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian tradition, focusing on key aspects such as the Last Supper, the establishment of a new covenant, the symbolism of Jesus' sacrifice, and the importance of community and remembrance. However, it would have been beneficial to emphasize more the theological aspect of the Lord's Supper as a means of grace and spiritual nourishment through partaking of Christ's body and blood. Overall, a good understanding is demonstrated."
