They addressed key aspects such as reflecting God's nature, healing relationships, promoting unity, and personal freedom, all of which are important in understanding the significance of forgiveness in loving others. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly emphasizing the unconditional nature of God's love as the foundational reason for forgiveness, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, focusing more explicitly on the core biblical principle of forgiveness as a reflection of God's love could have strengthened their response even further."
