  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately states that the names of the twelve disciples are mentioned in multiple books (Matthew, Mark, and Luke), which aligns with the correct answer provided. However, it could be more detailed and specific by mentioning the actual passages where these lists can be found, as the given response does. Additionally, the response could have been more comprehensive by including the passage from Acts 1:13 that lists the apostles after Jesus' resurrection.\n\nThe concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings is somewhat addressed in this response, but it could be further explored to provide a more well-rounded understanding of the disciples and their roles. Overall, while the response has some good information, it could be expanded upon to better address the given concern.\n\nComment: The response shows some knowledge of the biblical accounts, but could benefit from more specificity and depth in its discussion of the disciples and the Gospel accounts."
