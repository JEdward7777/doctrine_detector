The names of the twelve disciples are mentioned in several books of the Bible. Specifically, you can find lists of the disciples in:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4**
2. **Mark 3:16-19**
3. **Luke 6:13-16**
4. **Acts 1:13** (after the resurrection of Jesus, listing the apostles)

Each of these passages provides a slightly different context but includes the names of the twelve disciples. If you have any further questions about the disciples or the context in which they are mentioned, feel free to ask!
