It would have been beneficial to delve further into the unique aspects of Jesus as the Messiah in Christianity, emphasizing his divinity and unique role in salvation. Additionally, while sensitivity and respect are important, it is crucial to prioritize doctrinal accuracy when discussing religious concepts from different worldviews."
