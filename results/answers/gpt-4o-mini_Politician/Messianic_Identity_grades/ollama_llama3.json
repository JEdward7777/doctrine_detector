The provided answer only mentions that Jesus is a descendant of King David and that his reign is eternal, but does not fully articulate the theological significance of the title \"King of the Jews\" in relation to Jesus' identity as the Messiah.\n\nThe concern emphasizes the importance of understanding Jesus' messianic role, which this response only partially addresses. It would be beneficial for the response to delve deeper into the historical and cultural context of the title, its implications for Christian theology, and how it relates to Jesus' teachings and actions in the Gospels.\n\nTo improve, the response could provide more specific examples from Scripture or early Christian writings that demonstrate Jesus' role as the Messiah and King. Additionally, exploring the complexities and sensitivities surrounding this title would enhance the understanding of its significance in both Jewish and Christian traditions."
