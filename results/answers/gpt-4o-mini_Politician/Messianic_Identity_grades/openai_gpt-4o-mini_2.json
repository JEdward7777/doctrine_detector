It also offers additional context by discussing the significance of the title within the Jewish tradition, the spiritual versus political aspect of Jesus' kingship, and the historical complexities surrounding the title. The response could be further strengthened by providing more explicit biblical references to support the claims made about Jesus as the Messiah."
