  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of ministry in the context of the Bible, focusing on serving, caring, and supporting others with love and compassion. They correctly highlight the importance of selflessly serving others and promoting community and fellowship, aligning with the Christian values emphasized in the Bible. However, the answer does not explicitly mention teaching others about God, which is a fundamental aspect of ministry according to the reference answer. Encouraging the integration of spiritual teaching alongside acts of service would strengthen the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
