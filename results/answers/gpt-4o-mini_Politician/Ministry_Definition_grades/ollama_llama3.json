  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does a good job of providing a general definition of ministry and its association with Jesus' teachings, emphasizing serving others selflessly and promoting community. It also acknowledges that ministry can take various forms and is not limited to formal church roles.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the concept of ministry to the biblical context and specific passages. Additionally, while it mentions caring for spiritual needs, it does not fully explore the idea of ministering to physical needs as mentioned in the concern.\n\nComment: This response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical definition of ministry, but could benefit from further development and connection to specific biblical passages."
