It correctly highlights Jesus' teachings on selfless service and compassion. However, it could further strengthen its Christian worldview by explicitly connecting ministry with teaching about God and emphasizing the spiritual aspect of caring for others. Additionally, tying the concept of ministry back to the foundational biblical principles would enhance the response."
