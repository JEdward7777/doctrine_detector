It expands upon the basic definition by highlighting the importance of selfless service, inclusivity, and the diverse forms ministry can take beyond formal church roles. This understanding aligns well with the concern about the biblical definition of ministry being crucial for effective service in the church and community. However, the response could have strengthened its connection to specific biblical references or principles to further enhance its alignment with a Christian worldview. Overall, a solid exploration of the topic."
