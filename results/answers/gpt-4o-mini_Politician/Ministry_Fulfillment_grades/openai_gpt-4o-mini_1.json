However, while the response touched on understanding and applying Christian teachings in daily life, it could have been more explicit in connecting this to the specific calling or purpose that God has placed on individuals to serve others. It would have strengthened the response to explicitly link the fulfillment of one's ministry with discerning and carrying out God's unique calling in serving others."
