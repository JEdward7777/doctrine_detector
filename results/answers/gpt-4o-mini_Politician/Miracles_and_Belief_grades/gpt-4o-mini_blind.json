However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the foundational Christian belief that miracles are ultimately a display of God's power, intended to point people towards Him and His Kingdom. The answer could benefit from a stronger integration of biblical examples and teachings on miracles as signs of God's existence and sovereignty. Additionally, it could delve deeper into the concept of faith being a key component in interpreting miracles as signs from God. The reference to the subjectivity of belief in God is valid but could have been balanced with a stronger emphasis on the objective reality of miracles as signs of God's presence and action in the world."
