  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of how miracles can lead to belief in God, touching on personal experiences, community and tradition, philosophical reflection, moral guidance, and the extraordinary nature of miracles. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the specific Christian worldview perspective emphasized in the reference answer. While the student's points are valid and insightful, a stronger alignment with the reference answer focusing on miracles as indicators of God's power would have improved the grade. Additionally, incorporating more explicit Biblical examples or references to the ministry of prophets and apostles would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
