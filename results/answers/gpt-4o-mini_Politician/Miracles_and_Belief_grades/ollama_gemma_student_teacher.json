  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the role of miracles in faith. It covers various aspects of how miracles can inspire belief in God, including personal experiences, community narratives, philosophical reflection, moral guidance, and their contrast to the ordinary. The answer is well-written and demonstrates a sensitivity to different beliefs and perspectives. However, it would benefit from a more direct connection to the teacher's reference answer, specifically addressing how miracles serve as indicators of God's power."
