The original answer focuses specifically on the idea that miracles serve as indicators of God's power and prompt belief in Him. While this is a valid perspective, the response does not fully explore the other ways in which miracles can lead people to faith, such as through personal experiences, community and tradition, philosophical reflection, and moral guidance.\n\nThe concern about evangelism and personal faith is well-addressed in the original answer, but again, it could be more developed. For example, the response could have discussed how miracles can serve as a common ground for conversation with people of other faiths or no faith at all, or how they can provide a powerful apologetic for the Christian faith.\n\nOverall, the response provides some good insights and perspectives on the role of miracles in leading others to faith, but it could be more robust and comprehensive."
