The additional discussion on personal experiences, community and tradition, philosophical reflection, moral and ethical guidance, and the contrast to the ordinary further enriches the understanding of miracles within a Christian worldview. The emphasis on approaching the subject with sensitivity to different beliefs and perspectives demonstrates a compassionate and inclusive attitude, aligning well with the concern of enhancing evangelism and personal faith through the understanding of miracles."
