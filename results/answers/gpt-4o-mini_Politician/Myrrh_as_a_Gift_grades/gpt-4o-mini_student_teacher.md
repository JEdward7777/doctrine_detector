The gift of myrrh, presented to Jesus by the Magi, carries significant symbolic meaning in the context of his life and mission. Myrrh is a resin obtained from the Commiphora tree and has historically been used for various purposes, including as an embalming agent in ancient cultures. 

1. **Symbol of Suffering and Sacrifice**: Myrrh is often associated with burial and death due to its use in embalming. This gift foreshadows the suffering and sacrifice that Jesus would endure later in life, highlighting his role as a savior who would ultimately give his life for humanity.

2. **Royalty and Divinity**: Myrrh was also used in ancient royal ceremonies and religious rituals. By presenting myrrh, the Magi acknowledged Jesus' royal status and divine nature, in addition to his future suffering.

3. **Healing Properties**: Myrrh has been recognized for its medicinal qualities as well. This aspect can be viewed as symbolic of Jesus' role in healing and redemption throughout his ministry.

Overall, the inclusion of myrrh among the gifts, alongside gold and frankincense, offers a profound insight into the multifaceted nature of Jesus' identity: as king, divine being, and suffering servant. This depth of meaning enriches the narrative of his birth and the significance of his life and teachings.
