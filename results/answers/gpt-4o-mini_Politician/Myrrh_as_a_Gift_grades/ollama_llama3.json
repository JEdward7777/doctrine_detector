While it's not identical to the provided answer, it effectively conveys the same idea and goes beyond that to explore additional aspects of myrrh's symbolism (royalty, divine nature, and healing properties). The response also demonstrates a clear understanding of the concern, emphasizing how the gifts given to Jesus can enrich our appreciation for his purpose and mission. Well-done!"
