The additional insights on myrrh representing healing properties and its connections to Jesus' royal and divine nature enhance the understanding of Jesus' identity and mission from a Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how understanding the symbolism of the gifts deepens appreciation for Jesus' purpose and mission."
