  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-rounded overview of how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament. It effectively incorporates key principles such as speaking the truth in love, gentleness, respect, encouragement, prayerful preparation, focus on restoration, and listening with understanding. The references to relevant Bible verses further strengthen the argument. One suggestion for improvement could be to delve deeper into the theological implications of exhortation within the Christian faith. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
