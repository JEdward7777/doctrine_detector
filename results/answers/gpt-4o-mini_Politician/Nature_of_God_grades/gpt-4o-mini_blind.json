  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and insightful interpretation of Jesus' statement about God being a spirit and how it should influence our worship. The answer effectively highlights key points such as the transcendence of God beyond physical limitations, the importance of inner connection in worship, inclusivity, diversity of expression in worship, and stewardship of creation. The response could be strengthened by explicitly mentioning the importance of approaching worship with reverence, humility, and obedience in light of God's spiritual nature. Additionally, connecting the concept of God as spirit to key Christian doctrines such as the Trinity and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit could further deepen the theological richness of the answer. Overall, a solid and well-explained response."
