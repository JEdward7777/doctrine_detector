  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful answer that effectively explains the concept of God as a spirit and how it influences worship. They have highlighted important aspects such as internal connection, inclusivity, diversity of expression, and stewardship of creation. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly answering the concern provided. There is a strong Christian worldview evident in the response, but it could have been more explicitly tied back to scriptural references to strengthen the connection to Christian beliefs."
