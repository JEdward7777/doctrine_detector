However, it lacks doctrinal clarity in delineating the orthodox Christian view of hell as a place of eternal conscious torment for those who reject Christ. This answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of repentance, salvation through Jesus, and the eternal consequences of sin as taught in traditional Christian theology."
