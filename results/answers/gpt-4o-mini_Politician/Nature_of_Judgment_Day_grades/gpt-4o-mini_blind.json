The student accurately references key passages such as Revelation 20:11-15 and Matthew 25:31-46 to support their explanation. However, the response could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of repentance and the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ in the context of Judgment Day, as these are central doctrines in Christianity. Additionally, more clarity on the eternal consequences of judgment based on one's relationship with Christ could enhance the depth of the explanation."
