  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 90. \n\nThe student effectively explains that in a Christian context, \"Judgment Day\" is when God judges all humanity based on their faith and actions, drawing upon relevant biblical passages like Revelation 20:11-15 and Matthew 25:31-46. They also correctly emphasize the importance of faith in Jesus Christ and living a life aligned with Christian teachings for attaining eternal life. The only slight deviation from the reference answer is that the student did not explicitly mention the evaluation of beliefs by God on Judgment Day. However, overall, the student provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the concept."
