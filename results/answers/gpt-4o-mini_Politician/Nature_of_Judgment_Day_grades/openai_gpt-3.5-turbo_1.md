# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In a Christian context, "Judgment Day" refers to the time when God will judge all humanity, determining their eternal destinies based on their faith and actions. This concept is rooted in various passages from the Bible, particularly in the New Testament. 

For instance, in the book of Revelation, particularly Revelation 20:11-15, it describes a great white throne where the dead are judged according to their deeds. Similarly, in Matthew 25:31-46, Jesus speaks of the separation of people like sheep and goats, representing the righteous and the unrighteous, based on how they treated others.

Judgment Day is often viewed as a time of accountability, where believers emphasize the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as a means to attain eternal life, while also highlighting the significance of loving one's neighbor and living a life aligned with Christian teachings.

Different Christian denominations may interpret the specifics of Judgment Day in varied ways, but the overarching theme remains one of divine judgment and the fulfillment of God's justice.
