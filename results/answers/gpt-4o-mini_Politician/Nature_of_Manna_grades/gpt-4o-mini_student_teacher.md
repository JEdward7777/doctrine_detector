In the Bible, specifically in the book of Exodus, manna is described as a miraculous food provided to the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness. Its appearance is likened to coriander seed, and it had a white color. In terms of taste, it is described as being like wafers made with honey, giving it a sweet flavor. This dual description reflects both the physical characteristics and the delightful taste of manna, symbolizing nourishment and sustenance during a challenging time.
