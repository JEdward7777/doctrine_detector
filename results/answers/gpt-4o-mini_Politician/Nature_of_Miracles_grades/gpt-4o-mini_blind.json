However, it falls short in explicitly emphasizing the foundational Christian belief that Jesus' miracles specifically point to His divinity as the Son of God. The explanation could have been strengthened by explicitly stating that the miracles were signs pointing to Jesus as the Messiah and the Savior of the world, fulfilling the prophetic promises of the Old Testament. Additionally, mentioning the significance of Jesus' miracles in confirming His deity and the unique salvific role He plays in the Christian faith would have further enriched the response. Further theological depth and clarity on these key points would have enhanced the overall quality of the answer."
