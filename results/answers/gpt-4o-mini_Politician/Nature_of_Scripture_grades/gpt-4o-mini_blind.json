It correctly distinguishes between the two terms and acknowledges the broader understanding of \"the word of God\" beyond just written text. The explanation aligns well with Christian theology and doctrine. However, to improve the answer further, the student could have emphasized more on the inspired and authoritative nature of scripture as the written word of God and how it is the primary source of divine revelation for Christians."
