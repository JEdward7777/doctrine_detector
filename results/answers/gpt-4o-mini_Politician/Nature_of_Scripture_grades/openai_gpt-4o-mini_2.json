  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and insightful explanation of the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word. It effectively differentiates between the terms \"scripture\" and \"the word of God\" within a biblical context and expands on how they relate to divine communication. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly incorporating Jesus' teachings as a crucial aspect of God's word, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the concern and presents a coherent Christian worldview perspective."
