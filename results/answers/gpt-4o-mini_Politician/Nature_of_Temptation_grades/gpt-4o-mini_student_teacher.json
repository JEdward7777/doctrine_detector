  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and thoughtful response discussing the roles of sinful nature and external influences in temptation. They demonstrate an understanding of the internal and external factors that contribute to temptation and highlight the complexities of individual experiences. However, the answer does not directly align with the Christian teaching perspective provided by the reference answer, which emphasizes that sinful nature drives us to desire what is wrong and external influences can entice us to sin, including the influence of Satan. The student's response is insightful and well-articulated but lacks the strong emphasis on the spiritual dimension of temptation as highlighted in the reference answer."
