  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-rounded understanding of temptation, incorporating both the role of our sinful nature and external influences, consistent with Christian teaching. It effectively acknowledges the internal struggle and external factors that can contribute to temptation. However, it could have more explicitly emphasized the ultimate source of temptation as rooted in our sinful nature alongside external influences such as societal pressures and peer influences. Overall, the response aligns well with Christian teachings on temptation."
