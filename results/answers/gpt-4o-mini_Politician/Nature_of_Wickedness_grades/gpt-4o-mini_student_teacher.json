  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 90. The student demonstrated a strong understanding of how the Bible addresses wickedness through various actions, intentions, social justice issues, and consequences. They also appropriately included references to biblical verses to support their points and highlighted the potential for redemption. However, the response could have been improved by directly relating more of the discussion back to how biblical perspectives on wickedness influence moral behavior and spiritual growth. Overall, a well-written and insightful answer."
