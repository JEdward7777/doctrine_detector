The inclusion of key biblical terms (nephesh, psuche, ruach, pneuma) is commendable. The response could have been stronger by referencing specific Bible verses that highlight the differences between 'soul' and 'spirit' more explicitly. Additionally, the mention of different theological perspectives could have been elaborated to provide a more comprehensive understanding. Overall, a solid explanation with room for some improvements."
