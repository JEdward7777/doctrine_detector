  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible, showing a good understanding of the nuances involved. The answer was well-written and demonstrated a thoughtful engagement with the topic. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of ensuring accurate interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God. The grade reflects the quality of the response in terms of biblical knowledge and explanation, although there was room for improvement in addressing the specific concern highlighted."
