  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. The answer accurately identifies and explains the prohibitions of abstaining from wine and grapes, avoiding haircuts, and staying away from contact with the dead. The inclusion of how these restrictions demonstrate a commitment to holiness and dedication to God is commendable. However, to improve the grade, the response could have delved deeper into the spiritual significance and symbolism behind each restriction within the context of the Nazirite vow."
