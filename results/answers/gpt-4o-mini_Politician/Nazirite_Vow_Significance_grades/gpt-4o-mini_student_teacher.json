  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow, including abstaining from wine and grapes, avoiding haircuts, and avoiding contact with the dead. However, the student missed the specific detail of abstaining from food or drink made from grapes, as mentioned in the reference answer. Therefore, there is room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with the biblical context of the Nazirite vow."
