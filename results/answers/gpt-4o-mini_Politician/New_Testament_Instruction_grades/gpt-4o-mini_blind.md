In the New Testament, Christians are encouraged to engage with the Psalms as part of their spiritual and communal life. The Apostle Paul, for instance, instructs believers in Ephesians 5:19 to speak to one another with "psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs." This highlights the importance of the Psalms in worship and encouragement among Christians.

Additionally, Colossians 3:16 similarly emphasizes the value of letting "the word of Christ dwell in you richly" and teaching and admonishing one another through songs, including the Psalms. These passages suggest that the Psalms are not only a form of prayer and praise but also a source of spiritual wisdom and community building.

Furthermore, various Psalms are quoted throughout the New Testament, linking the teachings of Jesus and the apostles back to the Hebrew Scriptures, underscoring their significance in the Christian faith.

Overall, the New Testament teaches that engaging with the Psalms can enhance worship, foster community, and deepen one's understanding of faith.
