  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a well-structured and detailed response showcasing a good understanding of how the Psalms are integrated into Christian worship and community life based on biblical teachings. While the student's answer expands on the significance of the Psalms beyond just worship, the focus on singing Psalms to God as an act of worship, as presented in the reference answer, could have been emphasized more clearly to directly address the concern of applying biblical teachings to contemporary Christian worship. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic."
