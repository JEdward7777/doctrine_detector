It effectively addresses the concern by showing how the instructions to sing psalms in worship are rooted in the New Testament and emphasize the importance of the Psalms in contemporary Christian worship practices. The incorporation of specific biblical references and the explanation of the multifaceted roles of the Psalms in spiritual and communal life enhance the depth of understanding."
