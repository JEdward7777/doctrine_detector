  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers, citing relevant biblical passages and emphasizing the individual believer's direct access to God. The student effectively highlights the significance and implications of this doctrine, promoting communal support and individual responsibility within the faith community. A few areas for improvement include delving deeper into the sacrificial aspect of priesthood and the role of intercession, as well as connecting the priesthood of believers to Christ's role as the ultimate High Priest."
