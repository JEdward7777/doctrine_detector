  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively explains the concept of the priesthood of all believers, citing relevant biblical passages and discussing the implications of this doctrine in the Christian faith. The response highlights the accessibility to God, communal support, and the worth of each individual in contributing to the faith community, aligning well with the Christian worldview. Minor improvements could be made by directly stating the central idea of believers being able to come directly to God in prayer to intercede for themselves and others, as referenced in the teacher's answer."
