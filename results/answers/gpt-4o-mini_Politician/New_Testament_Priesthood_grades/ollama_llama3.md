## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of every believer in Jesus being considered a priest is rooted in the idea of the "priesthood of all believers." This doctrine suggests that, through faith in Christ, all individuals have direct access to God without the need for a human intermediary, like a traditional priest. 

This understanding is based on several key biblical passages, including 1 Peter 2:9, which states that believers are "a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation," emphasizing both the dignity and responsibility that comes with this identity. In the book of Revelation, it is also affirmed that believers are made to be "a kingdom and priests to serve our God."

The implications of this priesthood are significant. It indicates that every believer has a role in the spiritual community, allowing them to engage in worship, prayer, and service to others. It fosters a sense of equality among believers, acknowledging that each person has unique gifts and a role to play in the body of Christ. Additionally, this perspective encourages personal responsibility in spiritual growth and communal support, as each member contributes to the well-being of the faith community.

In summary, the notion of every believer as a priest emphasizes accessibility to God, communal support, and the worth of each individual in contributing to their faith community. It reflects the inclusive nature of Christianity, inviting everyone to participate in their spiritual journey.
