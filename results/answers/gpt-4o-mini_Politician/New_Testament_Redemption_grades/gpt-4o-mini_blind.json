The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the theological evolution and the significance of Jesus' teachings in redefining purification. The answer could be further enhanced by citing specific Old Testament passages and New Testament verses to support the points made. Additionally, connecting the concept of purification to broader theological themes like atonement and redemption would have strengthened the argument. Overall, a strong response with room for minor improvements."
