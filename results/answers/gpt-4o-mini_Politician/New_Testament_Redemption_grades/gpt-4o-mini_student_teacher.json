They accurately identified the shift from external ritualistic practices to internal spiritual transformation in the New Testament. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly connecting the concept of purification in the New Testament to the sufficiency of Christ\u2019s sacrifice as the ultimate means of eternal purification from sin, as outlined in the given concern. Overall, solid understanding and analysis were demonstrated."
