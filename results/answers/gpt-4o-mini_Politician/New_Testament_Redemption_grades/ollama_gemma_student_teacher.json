  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the evolution of the concept of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament. The student clearly explains the shift from a focus on ceremonial purity to spiritual transformation through faith in Jesus Christ. The reference to the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of purification is particularly relevant and aligns with the specified concern."
