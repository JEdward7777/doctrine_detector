  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of highlighting the evolution in understanding purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament, and it correctly emphasizes the shift from ritualistic practices to faith in Jesus as the means of spiritual cleansing. The analysis is thorough and well-supported by biblical examples. The conclusion effectively summarizes the key point that the New Testament presents a deeper, more spiritual concept of purification.\n\nHowever, I deduct 15 points because the response does not explicitly highlight the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin. While it mentions Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection, it does not explicitly state that this is sufficient for eternal purification, but rather implies it through the discussion of repentance and trust in Jesus. To earn a higher grade, the response could have more clearly emphasized the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of purification and its development from the Old Testament to the New Testament."
