  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and thorough examination of the available evidence from the New Testament regarding John the Baptist and the Nazirite vow. They provide well-reasoned arguments based on textual references and historical parallels. \n\nHowever, the grade is slightly deducted because the student did not explicitly mention the reference answer provided by the teacher concerning the angel's announcement to Zechariah. Including this additional evidence would have strengthened the student's overall argument."
