  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that accurately explains the purpose of Noah's Ark in terms of rescue and preservation as outlined in the Bible. The response effectively highlights themes of salvation, obedience, and the covenant with God. However, the student could strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting the purpose of the Ark to God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative of Noah's Ark, as outlined in the concern."
