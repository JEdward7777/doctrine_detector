  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a broad and inclusive perspective on how listening to God can connect to wisdom, touching on various aspects such as guidance, moral framework, reflection, community, and long-term perspective. While these points are valuable, the student did not explicitly emphasize the importance of obedience to God as the reference answer did. In a Christian worldview, the act of obedience to God is essential in the journey towards wisdom, as it signifies trust, submission, and alignment with God's divine will. The student's response would benefit from making this connection more explicit and highlighting the significance of obedience as a key component in becoming wise according to Christian beliefs."
