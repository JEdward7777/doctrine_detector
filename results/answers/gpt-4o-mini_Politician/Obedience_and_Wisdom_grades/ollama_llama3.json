  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively explores various ways in which listening to God can contribute to wisdom, highlighting its potential benefits for individuals across different spiritual traditions. It also acknowledges the importance of community and self-awareness, demonstrating an understanding that wisdom is not solely individualized but can be cultivated collectively.\n\nWhile the response does not directly address the concern about recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom, it does indirectly touch on this idea by emphasizing the importance of humbly obeying God's will. This subtle connection may not be explicitly stated, but it is implicit in the response's overall tone and emphasis on listening to God.\n\nTo achieve a perfect score, the response could have been more explicit in highlighting the link between obedience to God and wisdom, as well as providing more concrete examples or biblical references to support its claims. Nevertheless, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the role of spiritual beliefs in cultivating wisdom and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to exploring this topic.\n\nComment: The response is strong in its exploration of various aspects that contribute to wisdom, but could be improved by more explicitly acknowledging the link between obedience to God and wisdom."
