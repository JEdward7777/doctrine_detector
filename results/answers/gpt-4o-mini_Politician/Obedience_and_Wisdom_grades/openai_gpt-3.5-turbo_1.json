  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned and insightful exploration of how listening to God contributes to wisdom, incorporating various dimensions such as guidance, moral framework, self-awareness, community, and long-term perspective. The emphasis on aligning decisions with God's will for wisdom is consistent with the Christian worldview. While the focus is more on the broader implications of listening to God rather than direct obedience, which is the key concern provided, the content aligns well within a Christian perspective on wisdom and spirituality."
