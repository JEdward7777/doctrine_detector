  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated perspective on the ways in which listening to God can lead to wisdom. It acknowledges the importance of divine guidance, moral frameworks, self-awareness, community support, and long-term perspective in the pursuit of wisdom. While the response captures various facets of wisdom, it slightly deviates from the explicitly stated concern of emphasizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom as critical for spiritual growth. However, the inclusion of diverse perspectives and the respectful tone towards different beliefs contribute positively to the overall discussion."
