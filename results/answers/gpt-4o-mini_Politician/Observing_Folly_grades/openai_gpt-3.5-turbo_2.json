  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of actions considered folly in biblical texts and effectively links them to the concern of encouraging better decision-making aligned with God\u2019s will. The examples given are supported by relevant scriptures, demonstrating a strong understanding of biblical principles. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include additional references from the Bible to further reinforce the connection between recognizing folly and making decisions in line with God\u2019s will."
