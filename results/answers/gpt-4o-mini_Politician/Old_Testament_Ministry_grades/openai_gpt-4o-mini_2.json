  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the roles and responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, highlighting the importance of sacrificial offerings, ritual purity, teaching the Law, intercession, temple maintenance, celebration of festivals, and daily offerings. It effectively connects the practices of the Old Testament to the broader concept of sacrificial service in ministry today. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly mention how understanding these practices can inform and shape current ministry approaches, but overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
