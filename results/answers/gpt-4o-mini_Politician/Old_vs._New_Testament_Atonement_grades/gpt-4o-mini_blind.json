The student shows a strong understanding of the sacrificial system in the Old Testament and the transformative understanding of atonement through Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The response is well-structured, supported by relevant biblical references, and effectively explores the differences in understanding and application of atonement between the two Testaments. The explanation aligns well with Christian theology and presents the evolution of the concept of atonement in a clear and insightful manner. Great job!"
