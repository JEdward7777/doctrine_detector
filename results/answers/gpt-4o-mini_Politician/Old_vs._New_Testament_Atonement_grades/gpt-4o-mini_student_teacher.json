  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured comparison of the concept of atonement in the Old Testament and New Testament, highlighting key differences in sacrificial practices, covenantal relationships, the role of Jesus Christ, and the shift towards grace and faith. The student effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. However, the reference answer succinctly captures the core difference between the two testaments regarding atonement, which the student's response elaborates on. Overall, the student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview."
