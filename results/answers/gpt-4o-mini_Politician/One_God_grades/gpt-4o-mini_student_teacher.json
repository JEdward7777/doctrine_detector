  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful strategies for translating the concept of 'One God' while respecting cultural beliefs, which is commendable. However, the proposed approaches lack a direct emphasis on the unique nature of God and the Trinity, which are crucial aspects of biblical monotheism. The student's answer could be improved by explicitly highlighting these aspects to uphold the biblical truth of one God more effectively in the context of cultural polytheism."
