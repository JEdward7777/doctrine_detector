  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the challenges involved in translating the concept of 'One God' for cultures that respect multiple deities. The proposed strategies are practical and respectful of diverse belief systems. \n\nThe inclusion of suggestions such as contextualizing the concept, emphasizing attributes, using inclusive language, and engaging with local leaders shows a sensitivity to the cultural context and a willingness to foster dialogue rather than confrontation. \n\nWhile the answer does not explicitly mention the Trinity, it implicitly acknowledges the uniqueness and supremacy of God without compromising the biblical monotheism. The emphasis on God's unique nature aligns with the teacher's reference answer."
