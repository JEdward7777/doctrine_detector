However, the concern emphasized the importance of upholding biblical monotheism without compromise, and the response could have more explicitly emphasized the uniqueness of God's nature and the Trinity in its strategies. While the strategies presented are respectful and inclusive, they could have been strengthened by a clearer emphasis on the biblical truth of one God, especially in the context of addressing cultural polytheism."
