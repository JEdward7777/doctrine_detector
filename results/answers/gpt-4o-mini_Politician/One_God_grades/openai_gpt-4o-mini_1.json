While the strategies are sensitive and inclusive, there is a concern that some of the approaches may dilute the biblical truth of one God. It is important to ensure that while adapting to different cultures, there is no compromise on the core doctrine of monotheism and the Trinity as revealed in the Bible. Encouraging discussions about the nature of divinity and engaging with local leaders are beneficial, but it is crucial to maintain clarity on the uniqueness and supremacy of the Christian God."
