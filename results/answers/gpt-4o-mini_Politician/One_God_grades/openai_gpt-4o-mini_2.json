  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides effective strategies for translating the concept of 'One God' into cultures with belief in multiple deities while maintaining biblical monotheism. The strategies offered are respectful, culturally sensitive, and focused on building bridges rather than confrontation. The emphasis on God's unique nature and the Trinity aligns well with upholding biblical truth. However, it would have been beneficial to see a stronger emphasis on the exclusivity of God within the Christian faith. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of balancing biblical truth with cultural sensitivity."
