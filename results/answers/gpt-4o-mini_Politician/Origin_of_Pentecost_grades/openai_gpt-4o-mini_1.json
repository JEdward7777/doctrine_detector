The connection to the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai is made, which sets the stage for understanding the relevance of this festival in anticipating its fulfillment through Christ in Christian theology. The response could have further emphasized how Shavuot foreshadows the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost in the New Testament and the fulfillment of the Law through Christ's sacrifice and establishment of a new covenant."
