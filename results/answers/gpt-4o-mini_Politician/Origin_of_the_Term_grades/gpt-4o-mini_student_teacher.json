  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided the correct location where Jesus' followers were first called 'Christians', mentioning the city of Antioch and citing the New Testament in the Book of Acts. The student also highlighted the evolution of the term 'Christian' over time, which is relevant to understanding its significance. The only minor deduction is for stating that the term is embraced by many denominations and groups within Christianity today, which is not directly addressed in the teacher's reference answer."
