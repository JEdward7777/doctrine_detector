It acknowledges the significance of understanding the heritage of the Hebrew people in order to grasp Biblical narratives. The mention of the Twelve Tribes of Israel further enhances the depth of understanding. The response could be improved by explicitly mentioning the spiritual significance of the Hebrew lineage in the context of God's covenant and plan as depicted in the Bible."
