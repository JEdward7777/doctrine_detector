  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good overview of the concept of pardon and its relation to God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ. However, there is a lack of direct reference to the New Covenant and the specific act of pardon through Jesus Christ as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. The student's answer could be improved by incorporating more explicit Christian theological connections to enhance the depth and accuracy of their response."
