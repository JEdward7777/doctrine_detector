It builds upon the given answer by providing more depth and nuance to the idea of pardon as a form of divine forgiveness. The writer successfully illustrates how this concept is transformational, not only releasing individuals from guilt but also inviting them to live a redeemed life. The emphasis on mercy, compassion, and personal growth adds richness to the discussion.\n\nHowever, while the response touches on the importance of extending compassion towards others, it could delve deeper into the practical implications of this concept in everyday life. Additionally, some sentences could be tightened up for greater clarity and cohesion. Overall, a strong effort that demonstrates a good understanding of the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness!"
