  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-explained answer connecting the significance of Passover to Jesus in Christian belief. They accurately discuss the parallels between the Passover lamb and Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb of God. However, the answer could be enhanced by focusing more on the direct connection between the Old Testament Passover and the New Testament revelation of Jesus, as emphasized in the reference answer. Additionally, emphasizing the theological significance of Jesus as the Passover Lamb for Christians would further strengthen the response. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated."
