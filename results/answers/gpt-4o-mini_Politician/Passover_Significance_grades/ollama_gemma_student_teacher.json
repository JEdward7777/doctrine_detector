The response clearly articulates the theological significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of the Passover lamb symbolism and highlights the parallels between the liberation of the Israelites and the redemption offered through Christ's sacrifice. The inclusion of references to Holy Week and the Last Supper further strengthens the argument."
