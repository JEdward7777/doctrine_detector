# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
For Christians, the celebration of Passover holds significant theological meaning, particularly in relation to the life and teachings of Jesus. Passover commemorates the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, as described in the Hebrew Bible. For Christians, this story is seen as a precursor to the New Testament events of Jesus' life, particularly his crucifixion and resurrection.

Many Christians view Jesus as the fulfillment of the Passover lamb symbolism. According to Christian belief, just as the lamb's blood marked the homes of the Israelites for protection during the Exodus, Jesus' sacrificial death is seen as providing salvation and liberation from sin for humanity. This connection is often highlighted during the Christian observance of Holy Week and Easter, which corresponds with the timing of Passover.

Furthermore, the Last Supper, which Jesus shared with his disciples before his crucifixion, is believed to have been a Passover meal, further strengthening the link between these two significant religious events. 

In summary, for Christians, the celebration of Passover signifies not only a historical event but also a profound theological connection to the life, sacrifice, and resurrection of Jesus, emphasizing themes of deliverance, hope, and redemption.
