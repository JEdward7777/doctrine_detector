  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response effectively explains the central role of faith in Jesus' sacrifice in achieving peace with God according to scripture. The explanation is supported by relevant Bible verses and provides a clear understanding of the theological significance of Jesus' redemptive work. The connection between faith, grace, and salvation is well articulated. The response could be further enriched by delving deeper into the concept of atonement and the implications of Jesus' sacrifice in the Christian faith."
