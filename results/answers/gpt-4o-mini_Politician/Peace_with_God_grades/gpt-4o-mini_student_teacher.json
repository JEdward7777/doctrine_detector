  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively explores the significance of faith in Jesus' sacrifice in achieving peace with God. The response is grounded in scripture and demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on this key theological concept. A slight deduction is made for the slightly verbose nature of the response compared to the reference answer, but overall, the student's grasp of the topic is commendable."
