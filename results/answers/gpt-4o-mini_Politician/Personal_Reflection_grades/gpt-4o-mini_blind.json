However, from a Christian worldview, the answer could be enhanced by delving deeper into the spiritual aspect of sorrow and sin, emphasizing the need for repentance, seeking divine help, and the potential for redemption through Christ. Additions linking the phrase to Biblical examples or teachings would have strengthened the answer."
