They effectively discuss the theological and social tensions that arose due to differing interpretations of the law. However, the answer could be improved by more directly addressing the concern raised about understanding the role of the Pharisees in providing insight into the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry. Additionally, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly answering the question without delving into tangential discussions."
