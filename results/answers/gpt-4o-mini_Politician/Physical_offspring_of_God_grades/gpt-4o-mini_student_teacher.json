  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and respectful approach to clarifying the term \"Son of God\" for someone who may misunderstand it as implying physical offspring of God. While the response offers valuable insights on historical context, theological explanations, metaphors, diversity of meanings, and open dialogue, it somewhat dilutes the central Christian teaching regarding Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God. The student should have emphasized more strongly the Christian-specific viewpoint that 'Son of God' primarily refers to Jesus' unique divine status and not physical procreation."
