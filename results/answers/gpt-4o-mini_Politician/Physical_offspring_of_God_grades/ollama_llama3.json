  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of explaining the term \"Son of God\" in a way that's inclusive and respectful, highlighting its metaphorical and theological significance rather than just focusing on a literal interpretation. It also emphasizes the importance of engaging with diverse perspectives and fostering open dialogue.\n\nHowever, while it does touch on the idea that Jesus' divine nature is an essential aspect of what \"Son of God\" means, it could have done more to explicitly connect this concept back to biblical teaching and doctrine. The concern about preventing doctrinal errors and retaining biblical terminology is well-taken, and the response could have been strengthened by providing more explicit biblical support for its explanation.\n\nThat being said, the response does a great job of providing a nuanced and thoughtful approach to understanding this complex term, and it's likely to be helpful in fostering greater understanding and appreciation among people from different backgrounds."
