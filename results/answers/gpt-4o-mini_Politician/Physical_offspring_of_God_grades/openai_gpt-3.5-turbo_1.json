  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response does an excellent job of addressing the concern by clarifying the term \"Son of God\" as referring to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God rather than physical procreation. The suggested approach emphasizes the importance of proper teaching to prevent doctrinal errors and retain biblical terminology, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The response also promotes respectful dialogue, encourages understanding of diverse perspectives, and acknowledges the metaphorical nature of religious language. Overall, this response effectively balances theological accuracy with inclusivity and sensitivity."
