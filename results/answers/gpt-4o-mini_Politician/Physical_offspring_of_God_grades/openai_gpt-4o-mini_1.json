The theological explanation aligns with Christian doctrine by emphasizing Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, thereby helping to prevent doctrinal errors and retain biblical terminology. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly reinforcing the centrality of Jesus' divinity as the Son of God within Christian belief."
