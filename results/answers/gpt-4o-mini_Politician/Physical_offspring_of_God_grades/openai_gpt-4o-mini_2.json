It acknowledges the importance of proper teaching to prevent doctrinal errors and retain biblical terminology. However, the focus is more on facilitating understanding through diverse perspectives rather than solely emphasizing the specific Christian understanding of the term. More emphasis on the unique Christian perspective while still promoting respectful dialogue would have strengthened the response."
