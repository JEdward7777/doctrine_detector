  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written explanation of physical death and the spiritual concept of 'perish' from a broad and general perspective, considering cultural and philosophical aspects. However, from a Christian worldview, the essence of 'perish' should be more clearly tied to the eternal separation from God for those who do not trust in Jesus, as highlighted in the reference answer. Therefore, the student's response lacks specificity in emphasizing the critical distinction between physical death and the spiritual significance of 'perish' in light of Christian beliefs."
