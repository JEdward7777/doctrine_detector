  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish.' They clearly articulate the physical aspect as a biological process while acknowledging the broader spiritual implications. The student also highlights the importance of respecting diverse perspectives and cultural interpretations. The conclusion appropriately suggests discussing these concepts within their respective contexts. The response aligns well with the Christian specific worldview by referencing the concept of eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus."
