  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student's answer is generally accurate, mentioning several important aspects of early Christian fellowship such as listening to God's Word, praying together, sharing their belongings, and eating meals together. However, their answer lacks the depth and breadth of information provided in the model response. The model response goes beyond just listing practices and provides a more comprehensive overview of how early Christians expressed their fellowship.\n\nThe concern is also well-addressed as the student recognizes the importance of understanding these practices for contemporary Christians to foster deeper connections with each other. Overall, while the student's answer could be improved by providing more specific examples and details, it shows a good understanding of the main points involved in early Christian fellowship."
