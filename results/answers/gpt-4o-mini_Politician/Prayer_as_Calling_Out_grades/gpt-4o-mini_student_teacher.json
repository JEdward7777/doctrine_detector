  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided insightful interpretations of the phrase \"call out to the Lord\" in prayer, touching on seeking guidance, expressing urgency, building connection, offering praise, and affirming trust. However, the answer did not fully address the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life as specified in the concern. The reference answer emphasized seeking God urgently for help, trusting in Him, and depending on Him, which the student did not explicitly address. Encouraging the student to deepen their response by integrating the importance of dependence on God in daily life would enhance the overall grade."
