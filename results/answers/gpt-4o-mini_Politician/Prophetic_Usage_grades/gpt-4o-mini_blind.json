  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of how the term \"Daughter of Zion\" is utilized in Biblical prophecies. It accurately highlights the symbolic, emotional, and theological significance attached to this term in the prophetic literature. The explanation is doctrinally sound and captures the essence of the topic well. However, to enhance the answer further, the student could have included more specific references to particular Biblical passages that illustrate each point mentioned. This would have strengthened the argument by providing concrete examples to support their analysis. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
