However, there is a slight concern that the answer may have focused more on the symbolism and themes associated with the term rather than emphasizing the primary focus on the people of Israel and their relationship with God. Encouraging the student to ensure a clear connection between the historical context and the prophetic nature when discussing Biblical terms can enhance the application of scriptures in a Christian worldview."
