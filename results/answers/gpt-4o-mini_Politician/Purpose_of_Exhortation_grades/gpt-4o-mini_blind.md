Comment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament. They have rightly emphasized the role of exhortation in encouraging spiritual growth, promoting righteous living, unity within the community of believers, and the importance of accountability and support. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly tying the purpose of exhortation to scriptural references in the New Testament that highlight these aspects. Additionally, mentioning the role of exhortation in correcting errors or addressing sin would have added depth to the response. Overall, a good explanation with room for some theological nuance.
