It correctly mentions engaging the audience and fostering reflection. However, it could be improved by specifically highlighting the dual purpose of both revealing truth to those who have ears to hear and concealing it from those who are hardened in unbelief, in line with the biblical teaching in Matthew 13:10-17."
