  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student correctly identifies that Jesus used parables to convey spiritual truths and moral lessons in an accessible manner, there is a key element missing in their answer that aligns with the Christian worldview. The teacher's reference answer highlights the concept that Jesus used parables to reveal truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe. This aspect of parables serving as a way to separate those who truly sought understanding from those who were indifferent or opposed to his teachings is an essential element in understanding the teaching methods of Jesus within a Christian framework. Encouraging the student to include this aspect would strengthen their answer and align it more closely with a Christian worldview."
