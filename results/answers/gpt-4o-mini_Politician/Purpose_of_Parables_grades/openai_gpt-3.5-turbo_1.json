However, it could have delved deeper into the implications for faith, connecting the concept of hidden truths to the importance of faith and understanding in the context of Jesus' teachings. Additionally, reinforcing the significance of parables as a tool for engaging listeners and challenging them to reflect on spiritual truths would have enriched the response further."
