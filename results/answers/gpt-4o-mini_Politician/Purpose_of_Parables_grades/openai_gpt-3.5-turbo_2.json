It correctly highlights the aspect of revealing truth to disciples while hiding it from non-believers. The concern on understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith is addressed effectively with a Christian worldview perspective. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more specific biblical references to support the points made."
