The answer effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how parables serve to reveal truths to disciples while hiding them from those who do not believe, emphasizing the importance of understanding Jesus' teaching methods in relation to faith. However, the response could have further delved into the transformative power of parables in shaping individuals' beliefs and actions, which would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
