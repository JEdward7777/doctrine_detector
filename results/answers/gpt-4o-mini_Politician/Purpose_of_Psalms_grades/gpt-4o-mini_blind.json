The student effectively outlines the multiple functions of the Psalms, such as their use in liturgy, expression of emotions, theological teachings, personal reflection, historical remembrance, community solidarity, and prophetic/messianic hopes. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a strong understanding of the subject matter. Well done!"
