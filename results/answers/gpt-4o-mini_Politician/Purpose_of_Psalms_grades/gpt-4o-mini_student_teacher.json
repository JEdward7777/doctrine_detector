  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the role of Psalms in the worship practices of ancient Israel, covering various aspects such as liturgy, emotional expression, theological teaching, personal reflection, historical remembrance, community solidarity, and prophetic hopes. While the student's answer goes beyond the specific concern of understanding historical context and purpose, it effectively demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. This answer is rich in content and insights but could benefit from linking the provided information back to the given reference answer to show a direct relationship between the two."
