  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-written and thoughtful response on the purpose of tests in religious contexts, the answer did not directly align with the Christian perspective provided in the reference answer. In a Christian worldview, the primary purpose of tests that God allows believers to experience is often seen as a way to expose sin, prompt repentance, and deepen one's relationship with God. The student's answer touched on some important aspects like spiritual growth and resilience, but it missed the specific emphasis on sin, repentance, and drawing closer to God that is central to many Christian beliefs on tests and trials."
