  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the purpose of tests in a Christian worldview. They acknowledge the diverse interpretations and perspectives on faith and adversity, highlighting the importance of inclusivity and respect. However, their answer lacks specific reference to the idea of exposing sin and drawing closer to God, which is explicitly stated in the teacher's reference answer. Including this element would have strengthened the overall coherence and alignment with the given concern."
