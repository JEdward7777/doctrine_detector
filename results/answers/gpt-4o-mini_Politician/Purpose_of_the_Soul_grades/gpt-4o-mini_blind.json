  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The response provides a general overview of the relationship between the soul and an individual's connection with God as described in various scriptures and faith traditions. However, it lacks specificity in terms of referencing specific Christian scriptures or doctrines. To improve the grade, the student should include more direct references to Christian scriptures (such as the Bible) and teachings to support their points. Additionally, the response could delve deeper into the Christian perspective on the soul's role in a person's relationship with God, emphasizing concepts like salvation, redemption, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Incorporating these aspects would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
