  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer exploring various aspects of the soul's relationship with God based on different scriptures and faith traditions. They effectively highlighted the soul's significance in spiritual growth, moral decisions, communication with God, and eternal perspective. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly aligning with the teacher's reference answer, which succinctly emphasizes the soul's role in spiritual connection and accountability towards God. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have further emphasized the spiritual and moral accountability aspect in relation to God as per the given concern."
