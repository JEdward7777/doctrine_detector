  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of the term \"Rabbi\" in the context of Christian teaching and makes a valuable connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate Rabbi. However, the response could benefit from a more direct focus on the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, as indicated in the concern. The student's discussion of the differences between Rabbis in Judaism and teachers in Christianity is informative but somewhat tangential to the specific question at hand. Strengthening the direct link to the concern would enhance the overall response."
