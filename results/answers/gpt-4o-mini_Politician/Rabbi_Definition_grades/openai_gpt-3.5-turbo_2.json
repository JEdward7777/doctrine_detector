The student shows a good grasp of the differences between the roles of Rabbis in Judaism and Christianity, highlighting the importance of respect and awareness in interfaith dialogue. The response could be improved by incorporating more specific examples or references to biblical passages where Jesus is referred to as Rabbi to further support the argument."
