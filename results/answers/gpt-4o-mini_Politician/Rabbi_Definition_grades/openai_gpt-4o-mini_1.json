It addresses the concern by emphasizing the differences between the roles of Rabbis in Judaism and Christian teachers in the New Testament, showing awareness of the nuances and importance of understanding these differences within a Christian worldview. The perspective offered aligns well with Christian teachings and promotes respectful dialogue between the two faiths."
