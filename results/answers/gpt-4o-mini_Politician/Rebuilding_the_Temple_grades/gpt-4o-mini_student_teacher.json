  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the history of the Temple in Jerusalem, detailing the construction of both the First and Second Temples, their destructions, and subsequent rebuilding efforts. However, the student's answer did not focus on the specific events that directly led to the destruction and subsequent rebuilding of the temple as outlined in the reference answer. The student's response covers a broader historical context without pinpointing the key events specified in the question. It is important to address the specific concerns raised to receive a higher grade."
