  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the significance and purpose of the Lord's Supper as established by the Apostle Paul. The student accurately highlights the communal, remembrance, and spiritual nourishment aspects of the practice. However, the response could have been strengthened by including more emphasis on the sacrificial aspect of the Lord's Supper, particularly in relation to Christ's sacrifice on the cross. It is important to emphasize the theological significance of the Lord's Supper as a remembrance of Christ's atonement for the forgiveness of sins. Overall, a well-rounded answer with room for a minor improvement in doctrinal specificity."
