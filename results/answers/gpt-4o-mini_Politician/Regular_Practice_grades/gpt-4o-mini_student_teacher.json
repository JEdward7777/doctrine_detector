  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-developed response highlighting the various reasons for the establishment of the Lord's Supper, emphasizing community, remembrance, and spiritual nourishment. While the student's answer touched on important aspects of the practice, it went beyond the core reason stated in the reference answer, which is to remember and proclaim the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The response reflected a good understanding of the significance of the Lord's Supper, but could have been more focused on the specific concern provided."
