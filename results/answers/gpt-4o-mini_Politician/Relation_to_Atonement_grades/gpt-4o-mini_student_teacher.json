  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated explanation of the relationship between propitiation and atonement, highlighting the key differences between the two terms. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concepts and effectively captures the essence of propitiation in relation to atonement. The mention of different religious traditions adds depth to the discussion, showcasing a broader perspective. However, the student could have drawn a more explicit connection between propitiation and appeasing God's wrath, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a strong effort with minor room for improvement."
