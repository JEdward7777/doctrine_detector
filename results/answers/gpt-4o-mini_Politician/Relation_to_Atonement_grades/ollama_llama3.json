  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of explaining the relationship between propitiation and atonement, highlighting that both concepts are related to reconciliation between God and humanity. The writer also provides a clear definition of propitiation as appeasing God's wrath specifically.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or biblical references to support their explanation. Additionally, while the writer does acknowledge the importance of understanding the differences and similarities between atonement and propitiation, they don't delve deeper into the nuances of each term beyond a brief summary.\n\nOverall, this is a solid effort that provides a good foundation for further exploration and discussion."
