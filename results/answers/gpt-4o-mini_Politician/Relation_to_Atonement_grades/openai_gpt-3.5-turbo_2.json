  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the relationship between propitiation and atonement, addressing the concern raised in the question effectively. The explanation is coherent and demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concepts involved. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to provide a more explicit example or reference to scriptural passages that illustrate the concepts discussed within a Christian worldview."
