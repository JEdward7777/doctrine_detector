## [Answer](../Repentance_and_Judgment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Bible addresses the concepts of repentance and the wrath of God in various passages, highlighting the importance of turning away from sin and the consequences of disobedience. 

In the New Testament, for example, 2 Peter 3:9 discusses God's desire for people to repent rather than face His wrath, stating that God is "patient" and not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. This suggests a compassionate approach from God, emphasizing His willingness to forgive and extend grace to those who turn back to Him.

In the Old Testament, passages like Ezekiel 18:30-32 encourage individuals to repent and turn from their offenses so sin will not be their downfall. Here, repentance is presented as a pathway to life, showcasing God's desire for restoration rather than punishment.

Overall, the biblical narrative highlights that while Godâ€™s wrath is a response to sin and disobedience, repentance provides an opportunity for forgiveness and reconciliation. The emphasis is on the transformative power of turning towards God and the hope inherent in His mercy.
