  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God, citing relevant biblical passages and emphasizing God's desire for repentance. However, the student could improve by explicitly connecting repentance as a necessary response to avoid God's judgment and receive His mercy, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer effectively communicates the importance of repentance in one's relationship with God but falls slightly short in explicitly framing it as a crucial step in avoiding God's wrath."
