The student accurately points out that Matthias was chosen through the casting of lots by the remaining apostles. The explanation could be improved by mentioning the specific passage in Acts where this event is recorded (Acts 1:15-26). Additionally, emphasizing the spiritual significance of this selection in maintaining the apostolic community and fulfilling the Scriptures would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
