  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response accurately identifies Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles and demonstrates a good understanding of the event as documented in the Book of Acts. However, the student's answer does not directly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, which was the main focus of the question. The reference answer provides a clearer and more concise response in this context."
