## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This selection is documented in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, where the remaining apostles cast lots to determine who would take Judas's place after his departure. Matthias was then numbered among the eleven apostles. This decision reflects the apostles' desire to maintain their community and the original number of their group.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response does accurately describe Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, and it also mentions the significance of maintaining the original number of the group. However, there is some room for improvement in terms of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.

While the response does not explicitly discuss the importance of maintaining the original number of apostles, it does acknowledge the desire to do so, which shows an awareness of the significance of preserving the continuity of apostolic leadership. The response could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting this event to the broader theme of recognizing the continuation of Jesus' work through the apostles.

Comment: While the response is generally accurate and shows some understanding of the importance of maintaining the original number of apostles, it could be improved by more explicitly discussing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.
