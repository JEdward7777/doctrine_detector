## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This selection is documented in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, where the remaining apostles cast lots to determine who would take Judas's place after his departure. Matthias was then numbered among the eleven apostles. This decision reflects the apostles' desire to maintain their community and the original number of their group.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response accurately identifies Matthias as the replacement for Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death, reflecting the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. However, the response could have provided more detail from a Christian perspective on the significance of maintaining the twelve apostles and how Matthias was chosen through the casting of lots in the Book of Acts to fulfill this role.
