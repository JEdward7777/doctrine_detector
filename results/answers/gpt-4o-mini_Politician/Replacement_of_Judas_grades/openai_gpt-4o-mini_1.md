## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This selection is documented in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, where the remaining apostles cast lots to determine who would take Judas's place after his departure. Matthias was then numbered among the eleven apostles. This decision reflects the apostles' desire to maintain their community and the original number of their group.

Comment: The response accurately states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and subsequent death, aligning with the Christian belief in maintaining apostolic leadership continuity. However, the response does not directly address how this decision reflects the desire to maintain the original number of apostles, as highlighted in the concern.
