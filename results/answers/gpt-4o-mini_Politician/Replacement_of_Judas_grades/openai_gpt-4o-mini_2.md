## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This selection is documented in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, where the remaining apostles cast lots to determine who would take Judas's place after his departure. Matthias was then numbered among the eleven apostles. This decision reflects the apostles' desire to maintain their community and the original number of their group.
