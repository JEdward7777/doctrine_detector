However, the response falls short in its doctrinal correctness. Peter's speech in Acts 2 does contain elements of divine plan and fulfillment of prophecies, but it also includes strong language of convicting the crowd of their sin and calling them to repentance for crucifying Jesus, whom God raised from the dead. The emphasis on hope and redemption should have been tied more closely to the foundational message of repentance and forgiveness through Christ. The response lacks depth and clarity on the gravity of the crowd's sin and the need for genuine repentance."
