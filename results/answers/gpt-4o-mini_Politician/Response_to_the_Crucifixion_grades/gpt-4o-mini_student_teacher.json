However, the response could have been more direct and concise in aligning with the teacher's reference answer, which focuses on Peter's clear statement about the crowd's responsibility in crucifying Jesus and the call to repentance and faith. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the theme but could benefit from a more precise explanation."
