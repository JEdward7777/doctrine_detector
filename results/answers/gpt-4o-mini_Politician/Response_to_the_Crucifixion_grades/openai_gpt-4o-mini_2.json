The emphasis on God's ultimate sovereignty in raising Jesus to life is appropriately highlighted. However, it would enhance the answer to further elaborate on the importance of repentance and faith as central themes in responding to the gospel message, aligning more closely with the Christian worldview of salvation through belief in Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection."
