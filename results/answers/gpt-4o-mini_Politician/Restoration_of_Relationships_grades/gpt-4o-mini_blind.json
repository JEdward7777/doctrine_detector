It is important to emphasize the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross for the forgiveness of sins and the necessity of faith in Him for restoration to God. The student should delve deeper into biblical teachings on redemption and atonement to provide a more doctrinally sound answer from a Christian perspective."
