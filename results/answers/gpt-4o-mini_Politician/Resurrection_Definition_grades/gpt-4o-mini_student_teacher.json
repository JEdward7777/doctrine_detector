  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a strong and well-explained answer that covers the key aspects of resurrection in a Christian context, including the resurrection of Jesus Christ as central to Christian faith, the promise of eternal life, and the future resurrection of all individuals. The response effectively ties the concept of resurrection to Christian beliefs about life after death. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the fundamental concept of resurrection as the act of becoming alive again after having died, emphasizing God's power in bringing someone back to life, as stated in the reference answer."
