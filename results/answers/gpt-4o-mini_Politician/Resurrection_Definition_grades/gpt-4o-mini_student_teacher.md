In a Christian context, the term "resurrection" primarily refers to the belief in the rising of Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion, as described in the New Testament of the Bible. This event is central to Christian faith and signifies not only the victory over sin and death but also the promise of eternal life for believers. Additionally, the concept of resurrection can extend to the belief in the future resurrection of all individuals at the end of times, when they will be brought back to life for judgment. The resurrection is celebrated by Christians during the Easter season, symbolizing hope, renewal, and the transformative power of faith.
