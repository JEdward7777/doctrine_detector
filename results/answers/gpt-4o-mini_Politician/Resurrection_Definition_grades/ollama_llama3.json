However, it lacks depth and nuance compared to the given answer. For instance, the response does not explicitly mention the biblical context or the concept's extension to the future resurrection of all individuals. Nevertheless, it demonstrates a basic understanding of the term's fundamental meaning and relevance to Christian beliefs about life after death, which aligns with the concern.\n\nThe provided answer is stronger because it:\n\n1. Provides more specific examples (Jesus' resurrection) to illustrate the concept.\n2. Explicates the biblical context, emphasizing God's power in bringing someone back to life.\n3. Offers a clearer connection between the concept of resurrection and Christian beliefs about life after death.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest providing more specific examples from Scripture, highlighting the significance of Jesus' resurrection as a demonstration of God's power, and exploring the implications for Christian beliefs about life after death."
