They correctly emphasized the importance of empathy, self-reflection, forgiveness, and positive communication. However, the answer could be improved by further integrating the Christian worldview perspective, such as emphasizing the ultimate authority of God as the judge and the need for repentance and redemption through Christ. Adding more scriptural references or theological insights would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
