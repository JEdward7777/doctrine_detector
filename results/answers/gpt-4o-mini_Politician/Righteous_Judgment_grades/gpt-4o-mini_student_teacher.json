  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-articulated response, exploring various perspectives on how Christians reconcile God's wrath with His loving and merciful nature. The inclusion of different theological viewpoints and the emphasis on God's redemptive purpose and covenantal relationship with humanity enhances the depth of the answer. Additionally, the acknowledgment of the limitations of human understanding in interpreting divine attributes is commendable. However, the student could strengthen their response by explicitly connecting their discussion back to the reference answer provided by the teacher, incorporating more direct scriptural references, and further emphasizing the ultimate demonstration of God's love and mercy through salvation and forgiveness."
