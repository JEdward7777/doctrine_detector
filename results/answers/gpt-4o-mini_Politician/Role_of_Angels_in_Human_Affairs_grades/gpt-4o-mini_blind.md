In biblical references, angels are depicted as messengers and servants of God who fulfill various roles in the divine plan. Here are some key ways they serve:

1. **Messengers**: Angels often deliver important messages from God to humans. For example, the angel Gabriel announced the birth of Jesus to Mary (Luke 1:26-38).

2. **Protectors**: Angels are described as protectors of God's people. For instance, Psalm 91:11-12 speaks of angels guarding individuals and keeping them safe.

3. **Worshippers**: Angels are portrayed as beings who worship and praise God continually. Revelation 4:8 describes the four living creatures around God's throne, proclaiming His holiness.

4. **Guides**: In various accounts, angels guide and provide direction. An example is found in Acts 8:26, where an angel instructs Philip to go south to the road leading to Gaza.

5. **Warriors**: Angels also engage in spiritual warfare on behalf of God’s kingdom. Revelation 12:7-9 depicts angels fighting against the forces of evil.

6. **Executors of God's Will**: Angels carry out God’s commands, as seen in the account of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) and during the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 12:29).

7. **Comforters**: They often provide comfort and encouragement to individuals in distress, as seen when an angel strengthened Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:43).

These roles illustrate the multifaceted ways angels serve divine purposes, reflecting their dedication and commitment to God’s will.
