It demonstrates a clear understanding of how angels deliver messages, protect, guide, worship, fight spiritual battles, and execute God's will. The detailed examples from scripture further support the description of angelic roles. However, the response could have included a stronger link between understanding these angelic roles and how they impact Christians' perceptions of divine intervention in their lives. Adding a deeper analysis of this connection would have further enhanced the response."
