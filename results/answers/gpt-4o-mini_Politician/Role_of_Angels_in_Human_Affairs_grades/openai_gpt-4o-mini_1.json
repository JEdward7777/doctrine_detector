  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively expands on the roles of angels in biblical references, providing specific examples and elaborating on how they serve God in different capacities. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological significance of angels in Christian belief and how their roles can impact believers' perspectives on divine intervention. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie the explanation back to how understanding these roles can influence Christians' perceptions of divine intervention. Overall, a thorough and well-supported response."
