  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response expands well on the foundational aspects of teaching, fellowship, and prayer as modeled by the apostles, demonstrating a deep understanding of community-building within the church. The additional insights on inclusivity, education, relationship-building, service, open dialogue, and resilience show a strong connection to the concern provided and offer valuable lessons applicable to modern communities from a Christian worldview. Great integration of biblical principles with contemporary relevance."
