The integration of inclusivity, education, relationship-building, service, open dialogue, and resilience aligns well with the concern of understanding community and teaching as integral aspects of church life modeled by the apostles from a Christian worldview. The response could be strengthened by including more explicit references to biblical passages or principles to further solidify the Christian worldview perspective."
