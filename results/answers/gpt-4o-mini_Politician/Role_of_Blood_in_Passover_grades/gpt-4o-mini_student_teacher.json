  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the blood in the Passover event both historically and symbolically, there is a lack of direct connection to the importance of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith, which was the specific concern outlined. The answer predominantly focuses on themes of protection, redemption, and symbolism, but does not explicitly tie these elements back to sacrifice and atonement in the Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student could have elaborated more on how the Passover event foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God, which is central to the Christian belief in atonement for sin."
