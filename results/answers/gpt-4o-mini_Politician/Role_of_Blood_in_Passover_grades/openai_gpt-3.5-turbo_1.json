It effectively elaborates on the protection and deliverance aspect related to the angel of the Lord passing over those houses marked with the blood of the lamb. However, the response could have further emphasized the Christian perspective on sacrifice and atonement, linking it more explicitly to the Passover event and its foreshadowing of Christ's sacrificial atonement for sin."
