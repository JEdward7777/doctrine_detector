  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response does a good job of highlighting the various aspects of the role of eunuchs in ancient times, tying it to broader themes of inclusion and diverse societal contributions. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by directly linking the role of eunuchs to the reference concern of understanding the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom. The reference answer provides a more concise and direct connection to God's ability to use anyone for His purposes, which the student's response could have emphasized more explicitly."
