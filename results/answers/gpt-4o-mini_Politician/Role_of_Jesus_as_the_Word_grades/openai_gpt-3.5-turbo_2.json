It addresses the concern by highlighting Jesus' dual nature as fully divine and fully human, effectively connecting his divinity with his mission of revealing God. The response could have further discussed the aspect of Jesus being co-eternal and consubstantial with God to strengthen the Christian-specific worldview perspective. Overall, the response demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological implications of Jesus being referred to as \"the Word of God\" in Christian belief."
