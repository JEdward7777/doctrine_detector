The emphasis on avoiding negative stereotypes and promoting empathy is commendable. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Jesus' crucifixion from a Christian worldview perspective, especially in terms of understanding the fulfillment of prophecy and the redemptive aspect of Jesus' sacrifice."
