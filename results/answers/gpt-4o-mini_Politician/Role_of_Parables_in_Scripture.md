## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The prophet Nathan used a parable as a powerful tool to confront King David about his actions regarding Bathsheba and the subsequent death of her husband, Uriah. In 2 Samuel 12, Nathan tells David a story about a rich man who had many sheep and a poor man who owned just one lamb. The rich man, instead of taking from his own flock, took the poor man's beloved lamb to serve a visitor.

This parable served multiple purposes. It engaged David's empathy and sense of justice, prompting him to react with outrage towards the rich man's actions. Nathan then revealed that the story was a metaphor for David's own behavior, cleverly leading David to recognize his wrongdoing. By using a parable, Nathan effectively communicated a difficult truth in a way that was indirect yet impactful, ultimately leading to David's repentance. This method highlights the importance of wise and compassionate communication when addressing sensitive issues.
