  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of how the prophet Nathan used a parable to confront King David, accurately summarizing the story from 2 Samuel 12 and its significance in David's realization of his sin. The explanation effectively conveys the purpose and impact of Nathan's approach. However, to enhance the grade further, incorporating a deeper theological reflection on the biblical context and the implications of repentance and forgiveness within Christian teachings would be beneficial."
