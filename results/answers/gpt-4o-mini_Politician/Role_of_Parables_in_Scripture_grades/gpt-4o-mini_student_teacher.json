  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of how the prophet Nathan used a parable to confront King David, highlighting the effectiveness of this method in prompting David's acknowledgment and repentance. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. It could have been improved by focusing more on the direct impact of the parable on David's realization of his sin, similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
