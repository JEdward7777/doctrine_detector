  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, specifically highlighting the way Nathan used a parable to confront David about his sin. The example from 2 Samuel 12 is well-explained, and the analysis of the parable's purpose and impact is insightful.\n\nThe response also does a good job of connecting the biblical story to broader principles, emphasizing the importance of wise and compassionate communication when addressing sensitive issues. This shows an understanding of the larger theological implications of Nathan's use of the parable.\n\nTo reach a score of 100, the response could have further developed its analysis of the parable's significance or provided more specific examples of how this method is used throughout Scripture. Nevertheless, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good grasp of the concern and biblical narrative."
