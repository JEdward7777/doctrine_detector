## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The prophet Nathan used a parable as a powerful tool to confront King David about his actions regarding Bathsheba and the subsequent death of her husband, Uriah. In 2 Samuel 12, Nathan tells David a story about a rich man who had many sheep and a poor man who owned just one lamb. The rich man, instead of taking from his own flock, took the poor man's beloved lamb to serve a visitor.

This parable served multiple purposes. It engaged David's empathy and sense of justice, prompting him to react with outrage towards the rich man's actions. Nathan then revealed that the story was a metaphor for David's own behavior, cleverly leading David to recognize his wrongdoing. By using a parable, Nathan effectively communicated a difficult truth in a way that was indirect yet impactful, ultimately leading to David's repentance. This method highlights the importance of wise and compassionate communication when addressing sensitive issues.

I'd give this response a score of 85.

The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, specifically highlighting the way Nathan used a parable to confront David about his sin. The example from 2 Samuel 12 is well-explained, and the analysis of the parable's purpose and impact is insightful.

The response also does a good job of connecting the biblical story to broader principles, emphasizing the importance of wise and compassionate communication when addressing sensitive issues. This shows an understanding of the larger theological implications of Nathan's use of the parable.

To reach a score of 100, the response could have further developed its analysis of the parable's significance or provided more specific examples of how this method is used throughout Scripture. Nevertheless, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good grasp of the concern and biblical narrative.
