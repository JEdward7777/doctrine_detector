  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, they expanded beyond what was specifically mentioned in the reference answer. The student's answer encompassed various aspects of the priestly duties, incorporating elements like maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple, interceding for the people, and even judicial duties which were not directly mentioned in the reference answer.\n\nHowever, the student's response accurately captured the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, demonstrating a deep understanding of their roles in relation to worship, rituals, teaching, and intercession. The student also emphasized the importance of priests in maintaining the spiritual life of the community and facilitating a relationship between the people and God, aligning well with a Christian worldview."
