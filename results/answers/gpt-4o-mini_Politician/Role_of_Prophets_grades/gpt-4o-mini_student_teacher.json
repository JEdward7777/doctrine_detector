The response also correctly highlights the importance of prophets addressing moral and social justice issues and guiding individuals towards righteous living. However, the student could have emphasized more on the aspect of turning away from sins and obedience to God as the primary focus of a prophet's role, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
