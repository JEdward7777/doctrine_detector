The student clearly explains that prophets are primarily messengers of God, conveying both warnings and encouragement. They also highlight the importance of addressing social and moral issues, as well as the potential for prophecy to foretell future events. The inclusion of a mention about different interpretations of prophecy across traditions adds an insightful touch."
