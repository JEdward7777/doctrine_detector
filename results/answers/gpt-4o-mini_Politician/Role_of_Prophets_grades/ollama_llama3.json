  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the primary role of a prophet as being a messenger of God, conveying His words and messages to the people. It also mentions that prophets provide guidance, warning, and encouragement, which aligns with biblical teachings. The mention of prophets addressing issues of moral and social justice is also relevant, as well as their role in foretelling future events.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples from Scripture to support its claims. Additionally, while it does acknowledge the importance of recognizing varied interpretations across different religious traditions, it could delve deeper into how these differing understandings can provide valuable insights into the significance of prophecy in the context of faith.\n\nThe grade of 85 reflects the response's generally accurate and relevant discussion of the role of prophets in biblical terms, as well as its recognition of the importance of understanding prophetic roles across different traditions."
