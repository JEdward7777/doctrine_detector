The mention of prophets addressing issues of moral and social justice is also relevant, as well as their role in foretelling future events.

However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples from Scripture to support its claims. Additionally, while it does acknowledge the importance of recognizing varied interpretations across different religious traditions, it could delve deeper into how these differing understandings can provide valuable insights into the significance of prophecy in the context of faith.
