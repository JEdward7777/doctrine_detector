However, while the response goes beyond the basic answer provided by the teacher, it could benefit from emphasizing the specific priestly tasks performed by the Sadducees in relation to offering sacrifices, which was the primary responsibility highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus would further strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
