  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the Sadducees' responsibilities in the Jewish temple system. It covers all the key aspects listed in the reference answer, including temple administration, sacrificial system, legal authority, and political engagement. The student also acknowledges the significance of the Second Temple period and the subsequent decline of the Sadducees after its destruction. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the Sadducees' theological beliefs and their specific interpretations of the Torah."
