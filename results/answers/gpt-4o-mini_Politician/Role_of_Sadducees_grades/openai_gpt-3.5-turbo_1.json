The response goes beyond simply listing the responsibilities and delves into the specific roles and influence of the Sadducees, showcasing a strong understanding of the topic. However, the response could have further highlighted the theological differences and conflicts between the Sadducees and other Jewish sects during that time to provide a more comprehensive analysis."
