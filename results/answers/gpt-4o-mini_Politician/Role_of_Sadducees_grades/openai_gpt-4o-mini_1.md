## [Answer](../Role_of_Sadducees.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Sadducees were a significant sect within ancient Judaism, particularly during the Second Temple period. Their main responsibilities in the Jewish temple system included:

1. **Temple Administration**: The Sadducees played a crucial role in the governance and administration of the temple. They were often associated with the priesthood and held positions of authority, overseeing rituals and temple activities.

2. **Sacrificial System**: They were responsible for the management of the sacrificial offerings, ensuring that they were performed according to the requirements of the Torah. This involved maintaining the correct procedures and purity standards necessary for sacrifices.

3. **Legal Authority**: The Sadducees held significant power in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish court system, which allowed them to interpret and enforce religious law. Their interpretations often differed from those of other groups, notably the Pharisees.

4. **Curation of Scripture**: While the Sadducees accepted only the written Torah as authoritative and rejected the oral traditions upheld by the Pharisees, they were influential in the preservation and interpretation of the texts considered sacred.

5. **Political Engagement**: The Sadducees were often aligned with the ruling authorities, including the Roman Empire, which meant they had a role in negotiating and maintaining a degree of political stability for the Jewish community.

Their influence waned after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, as their practices and beliefs were heavily tied to the temple system itself.
