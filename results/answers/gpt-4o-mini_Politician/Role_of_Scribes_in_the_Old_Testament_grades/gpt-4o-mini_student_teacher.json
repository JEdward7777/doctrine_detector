  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the responsibilities of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures, they went beyond the scope of the question and concern by including details such as interpretation, commentary, maintaining sacredness, updating texts, and preserving oral traditions. The core focus of the question was on the responsibilities related to preserving the scriptures themselves. \n\nHowever, the student did accurately address the crucial role of scribes in copying and maintaining the accuracy of the Old Testament scriptures. They demonstrated a good understanding of the scribes' importance in preserving biblical texts, even though they delved into additional responsibilities."
