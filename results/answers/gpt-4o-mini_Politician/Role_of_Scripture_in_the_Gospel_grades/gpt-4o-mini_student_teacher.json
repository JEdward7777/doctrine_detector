  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed answer that effectively illustrates the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message. They have referenced key biblical figures and passages to support their points. However, the student could improve their answer by focusing more on the integration of Scripture specifically in the communication of the Gospel, as requested in the concern. Additionally, the response could have included more explicit connections to how the examples given relate to understanding the Gospel message."
