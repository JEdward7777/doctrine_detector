The analysis of Jesus' use of Scripture, the apostles' preaching, Paul's letters, the importance of context, and the role of the Holy Spirit all contribute to a comprehensive and well-supported argument. The reference to key Biblical figures like Jesus, Philip, and Paul adds depth to the discussion and showcases a strong grasp of how Scripture has been utilized in evangelism throughout Christian history. Great job overall."
