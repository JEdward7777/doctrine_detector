  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe original response provides a more detailed and nuanced exploration of the role of witnesses in the New Testament, discussing their importance for establishing the truth of events, fulfilling prophecy, and providing encouragement to believers. The added points about the apostles' experiences, the historical record, and the ongoing relevance of witness testimonies today demonstrate a deeper understanding of the significance of witness accounts.\n\nThe only area where the original response falls short is in its lack of explicit connection to the concern about Christians sharing their personal experiences with God's work in their lives. While it's implicit that witnesses' testimonies are meant to be an example for believers, the response could have more explicitly drawn parallels between the New Testament witnesses and contemporary Christian witness.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical text and its relevance to Christian practice, making it deserving of an 85 out of 100."
