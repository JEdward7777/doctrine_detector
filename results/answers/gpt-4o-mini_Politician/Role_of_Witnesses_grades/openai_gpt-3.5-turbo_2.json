The mention of the witnesses' contribution to fulfilling prophecy, emphasizing the authority of apostolic witness, and providing encouragement to believers adds depth to the explanation. The application of the concern regarding Christians witnessing their faith and sharing personal experiences aligns well with the Christian worldview, highlighting the importance of personal testimony in spreading the gospel message."
