However, the student's answer goes beyond the simplicity of the reference answer provided by the teacher, exploring additional details and insights. While the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the significance of the high priest's role in Israelite worship practices, the answer could have been more focused on the specific uniqueness of the high priest's responsibilities compared to other priests, as highlighted in the reference answer."
