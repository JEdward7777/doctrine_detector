While the student effectively covers multiple aspects such as Savior, Prophet, King, Priest, Healer, and Deliverer, the response lacks specificity and clarity in directly addressing the concern given the question. The reference answer provided by the teacher succinctly captures the key roles of the Messiah according to the Bible, specifically as a prophet, priest, and king initiating the New Covenant. Greater focus on these specific roles and their importance in understanding Jesus's mission and authority would have strengthened the student's response."
