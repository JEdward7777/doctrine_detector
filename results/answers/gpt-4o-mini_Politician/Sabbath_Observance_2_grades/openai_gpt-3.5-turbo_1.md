# Question [Sabbath Observance 2](../../../questions/Sabbath_Observance_2.md)
How did God instruct the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath?

# Correct Answer
God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna the day before the Sabbath so they would have enough to eat on their day of rest.

# Stated Concern
Importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands.

# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the biblical narrative, particularly in the Book of Exodus, God provided specific instructions to the Israelites regarding the gathering of manna, emphasizing the importance of the Sabbath. The Israelites were instructed to gather manna each day except for the Sabbath. On the sixth day, they were to collect a double portion, as no manna would be provided on the Sabbath itself. This practice underscored the significance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and reflection, allowing the Israelites to observe this holy day without the burden of gathering food. It's a remarkable example of how spiritual observance and practical needs were interwoven in the guidelines given to the community.
