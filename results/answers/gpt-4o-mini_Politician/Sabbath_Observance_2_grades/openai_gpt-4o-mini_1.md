## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the biblical narrative, particularly in the Book of Exodus, God provided specific instructions to the Israelites regarding the gathering of manna, emphasizing the importance of the Sabbath. The Israelites were instructed to gather manna each day except for the Sabbath. On the sixth day, they were to collect a double portion, as no manna would be provided on the Sabbath itself. This practice underscored the significance of the Sabbath as a day of rest and reflection, allowing the Israelites to observe this holy day without the burden of gathering food. It's a remarkable example of how spiritual observance and practical needs were interwoven in the guidelines given to the community.
