However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to recognize that the Biblical teaching for the Sabbath is based on the creation account in Genesis where God rested on the seventh day (Saturday). Christians believe that with the coming of Jesus Christ, the observance of the Sabbath was shifted to Sunday (the Lord's Day) to commemorate His resurrection. So while the response is accurate in a Jewish context, a Christian perspective on the Sabbath would involve observing it on Sunday."
