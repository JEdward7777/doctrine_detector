However, there was no mention of the importance of the Sabbath in promoting rest, spiritual rejuvenation, and community values, which are foundational aspects of the observance. Additionally, a Christian perspective could have been provided to emphasize the significance of the Sabbath in relation to God's commandments and the rest He offers to His people."
