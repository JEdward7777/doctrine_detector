  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of loving others sacrificially as demonstrated by Jesus, highlighting key aspects such as selflessness, active service, empathy, and personal sacrifices. The answer effectively connects these concepts to God's love and reflects on how they should manifest in personal relationships. The student's response is insightful and well-developed, but could be improved by more explicitly emphasizing the aspect of prioritizing others' well-being over one's own interests, as demonstrated by Jesus' ultimate sacrifice."
