  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed explanation of the beliefs of the Sadducees and contrasts it well with Christian teaching on resurrection. They effectively highlight the key differences and implications for faith between the two perspectives. However, the student's answer is more elaborate than necessary for the given question, which slightly detracts from the direct comparison. Thus, while the content is accurate and insightful, a slightly lower grade is given for not being as concise as the reference answer provided by the teacher."
