  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful analysis of Samson's story in relation to the implications of the Nazirite vow and the themes of commitment, strength, temptation, and redemption. Their answer effectively explored the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. While the student's response was thorough and well-constructed, it could have been further strengthened by directly aligning with the reference answer provided by the teacher and focusing more explicitly on the divine purpose as outlined in the Bible."
