## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The New Testament offers a variety of insights into the sanctification process for believers in Jesus. Sanctification is often described as both an instantaneous and ongoing process, reflecting the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life.

1. **Position and Process**: Believers are initially sanctified through their faith in Jesus (1 Corinthians 6:11). This establishes a positional sanctification, where they are set apart as holy. However, the process of becoming more like Christ—often referred to as progressive sanctification—takes place throughout a believer's life.

2. **Role of the Holy Spirit**: The Holy Spirit is central to the sanctification process. Believers are encouraged to live according to the Spirit, which empowers them to reflect Christ's character and resist sin (Galatians 5:16-25). The Spirit plays a vital role in teaching, guiding, and convicting believers.

3. **Scripture and Prayer**: The New Testament emphasizes the importance of scripture and prayer in the sanctification journey. Engaging with God's Word is seen as a way to renew the mind (Romans 12:2), while prayer fosters a deepened relationship with God and allows for spiritual growth.

4. **Community and Accountability**: The New Testament encourages believers to support one another in their faith journeys. Gatherings for worship, fellowship, and mutual encouragement help encourage sanctification (Hebrews 10:24-25).

5. **Obedience and Good Works**: While salvation is by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9), the New Testament underscores that genuine faith will naturally lead to a life of obedience and good works (James 2:17). As believers grow in their faith, they are called to demonstrate the fruits of the Spirit.

6. **Endurance and Hope**: Sanctification is portrayed as a journey that involves perseverance. Believers are encouraged to endure trials and challenges, which can serve to refine their faith and character (Romans 5:3-5; James 1:2-4).

In summary, the New Testament outlines sanctification as a multifaceted journey involving the believer's initial set-apartness, the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit, engagement with scripture and prayer, the importance of community, a life of obedience, and the call to endure through challenges—all leading to a deeper resemblance to Christ. This process is both a divine work and a human responsibility, fostering a rich relationship between the believer and God.
