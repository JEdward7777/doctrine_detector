  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student effectively explained how the sanctuary was described as a sacred space where God's presence dwelled among His people, highlighting its significance as a place for worship, sacrifice, and communion. They also touched on the symbolic elements of the sanctuary and its importance in the community's spiritual life.\n\nHowever, the student missed the specific aspect of God referring to the sanctuary as a place where He lived among His people and as a source of safety for them. This detail was a key point in understanding the relationship between the sanctuary and God's people in the Old Testament. \n\nOverall, the student provided a thorough explanation of the sanctuary's role but could have strengthened their answer by directly addressing the concern regarding the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people."
