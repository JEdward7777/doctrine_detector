It accurately recognizes the sanctuary's significance in representing God's presence and providing a safe space for the Israelites. The reference to the sanctuary as a tangible representation of God's holiness and a place for worship, sacrifice, and communion with Him aligns well with the concern regarding the importance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people."
