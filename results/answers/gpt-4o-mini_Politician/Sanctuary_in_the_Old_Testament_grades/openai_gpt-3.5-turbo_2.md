In the Old Testament, God described the sanctuary as a sacred space where His presence dwelled among His people, the Israelites. It was seen as a tangible representation of God's holiness and a place for worship, sacrifice, and communion with Him. 

The Book of Exodus outlines specific instructions for the construction of the sanctuary, which included elements such as the Ark of the Covenant, the altar, and the Holy of Holies. These components symbolized God's covenant with His people and His desire for a relationship with them. 

Moreover, the sanctuary served as a focal point for the community's spiritual life, where they could come to seek forgiveness, guidance, and restoration. In this way, the sanctuary was not only a physical structure but also a profound symbol of God's love, mercy, and commitment to His people.
