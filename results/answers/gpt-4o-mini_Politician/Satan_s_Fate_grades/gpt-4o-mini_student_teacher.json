  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a general overview of different beliefs regarding the fate of Satan and his followers, but there was a lack of specificity and depth in discussing the Christian perspective on this matter. The response did not directly address the concern of how the fate of Satan has implications for understanding the struggle between good and evil in Christian theology. A clearer focus on the Christian view and its significance in the context of the question would have strengthened the response."
