  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses that emphasize the importance of interceding for others, highlighting key themes such as compassion, prayer, healing, and support within a Christian community. The selection of verses effectively supports the practice of intercessory prayer. The response could have been strengthened by providing a more detailed analysis or explanation of how each verse specifically relates to the act of intercession. Overall, the use of additional relevant verses and deeper reflection on their application could have enhanced the response even further."
