  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of connecting the theological concept of propitiation with biblical references, providing three key passages that emphasize Jesus' role as the means of reconciliation and fulfillment of divine justice. The inclusion of Romans 3:25 specifically highlights God's righteousness in passing over former sins through Jesus' sacrifice, which adds depth to the understanding of propitiation.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how these verses support the concept of propitiation and how they might be applied to everyday life. Additionally, while the response acknowledges diverse perspectives on theological interpretations, it does not explicitly demonstrate sensitivity to those differences or explore ways to engage with them in a constructive manner.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical basis for the concept of propitiation and effectively connects it to deeper theological concepts."
