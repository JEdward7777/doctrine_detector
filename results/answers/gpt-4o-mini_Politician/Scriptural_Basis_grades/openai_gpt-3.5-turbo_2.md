## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The concept of propitiation, which refers to the act of appeasing or satisfying the demands of justice, especially in the context of atonement in the Christian faith, is supported by several Bible verses. Here are a few key passages:

1. **Romans 3:25** - “Whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.”

2. **1 John 2:2** - “He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.”

3. **1 John 4:10** - “In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.”

These verses emphasize the role of Jesus Christ as a means of reconciliation and the fulfillment of divine justice through His sacrifice. In discussing these concepts, it is essential to approach them with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives on theological interpretations.
