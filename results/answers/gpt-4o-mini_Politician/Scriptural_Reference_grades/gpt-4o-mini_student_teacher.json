  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive overview of key biblical passages addressing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers, showing a good understanding of the topic. They offered a detailed explanation of each passage and its significance for believers navigating a world characterized by ungodly values. Additionally, the student incorporated a variety of verses from different parts of the Bible, showcasing a well-rounded view.\n\nHowever, the student missed the specific reference answer from the teacher, which highlighted different key passages. While the student's response was thorough and insightful, aligning more closely with the teacher's provided reference would have strengthened their answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong grasp of the topic but could benefit from closer alignment with the specified concern in the question."
