## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The concept of the 'world' in relation to believers is addressed in several biblical passages, each presenting a unique perspective. Here are some key verses that reflect different aspects of this theme:

1. **John 15:18-19**: Jesus speaks to His disciples about the world's attitude toward them, emphasizing that if the world hates them, it is because they do not belong to it. This passage highlights the distinction between believers and the world.

2. **1 John 2:15-17**: This passage cautions believers against loving the world or the things in the world, as the love of the Father is not in those who do. It encourages a focus on eternal values rather than temporary worldly pleasures.

3. **Romans 12:2**: Paul urges believers not to conform to the patterns of this world but to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. This encourages a mindset that seeks to reflect God's will rather than societal norms.

4. **James 4:4**: This verse describes friendship with the world as enmity against God, emphasizing the conflict that can arise between worldly values and spiritual commitments.

5. **Matthew 5:14-16**: In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus calls His followers the light of the world, encouraging them to exhibit good deeds that glorify God. This illustrates the role of believers in positively impacting the world around them.

6. **John 17:14-16**: In His prayer for His disciples, Jesus acknowledges that they are not of the world, even as He is not of it, suggesting a protective yet engaged relationship between believers and the world.

These passages collectively illustrate that while believers are called to live in the world, they are also encouraged to maintain their distinctiveness and uphold their values based on their faith.
