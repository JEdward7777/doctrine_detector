The student effectively references key verses from both the Old and New Testaments, showcasing a strong understanding of Christian doctrine regarding accountability, righteousness, and judgment. The inclusion of verses like Matthew 25:31-46, Revelation 20:11-15, and others aligns well with the theological emphasis on ultimate evaluation and personal responsibility before God. Great job connecting these passages to the overarching theme of judgment in Scripture."
