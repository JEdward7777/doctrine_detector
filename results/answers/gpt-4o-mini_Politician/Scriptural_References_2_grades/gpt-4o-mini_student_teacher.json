  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-organized and comprehensive list of biblical passages that support the concept of the day of judgment. They effectively explained the significance of each passage in relation to the theme of judgment, highlighting key aspects such as accountability, righteousness, and the ultimate evaluation of one's actions. However, the grade is slightly lower than perfect as the student missed referencing the specific passages mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively reinforces the scriptural basis for beliefs concerning judgment."
