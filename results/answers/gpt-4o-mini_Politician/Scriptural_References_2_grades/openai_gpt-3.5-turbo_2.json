The inclusion of various passages effectively supports the theme of judgment, emphasizing accountability, righteousness, and the ultimate evaluation of one's actions. The response aligns well with the concern of deepening understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforcing the scriptural basis for beliefs. Great job in presenting a holistic view based on biblical references."
