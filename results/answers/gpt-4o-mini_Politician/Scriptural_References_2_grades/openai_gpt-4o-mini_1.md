2. **Revelation 20:11-15** - This text depicts the Great White Throne judgment, where the dead are judged according to their deeds, emphasizing the importance of accountability.

3. **Romans 14:10-12** - These verses remind us that we will all stand before the judgment seat of God, highlighting personal responsibility and the ultimate accountability we have for our actions.

4. **John 5:28-29** - Here, Jesus speaks about a time when all in their graves will hear His voice and be raised for judgment, reinforcing the belief in universal resurrection and judgment.

5. **2 Corinthians 5:10** - This passage indicates that everyone must appear before the judgment seat of Christ to receive what is due for their actions in life, motivating ethical living.
