The incorporation of various passages from both the Old and New Testaments, along with the explanation of their implications, aligns well with the concern of deepening the understanding of scriptural teachings on judgment. The inclusion of additional verses would have further enriched the response, but overall, it demonstrates a strong grasp of the subject matter from a Christian worldview."
