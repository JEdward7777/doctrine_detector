  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the passage in Matthew as highlighting the contrast between outward appearances and inner moral character, which is in line with the given answer. It also correctly emphasizes the importance of integrity in one's faith, which aligns with the concern.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points for the following reasons:\n\n1. The response could have delved deeper into the biblical context and explored more nuanced implications of Jesus' teaching.\n2. While the response mentions \"genuine holiness,\" it does not explicitly tie this to a pursuit of Christlikeness or a desire to glorify God, which is crucial for Christian readers.\n\nThe comment I would leave for the grade is: \"Well-done! Your response accurately captures the essence of Matthew 23:27-28 and highlights the importance of integrity in one's faith. To take it to the next level, consider exploring more deeply how Jesus' teaching challenges external compliance with religious standards and encourages a pursuit of genuine holiness that honors God.\""
