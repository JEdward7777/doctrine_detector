The connection between iniquity and integrity in faith is well articulated. The reflection encourages self-examination and humility, promoting genuine goodness from within. The only slight deduction is that the response could have delved deeper into the specific Christian call to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards. Overall, a strong Christian worldview perspective is presented."
