## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The New Testament does show a shift in the understanding of Hades, moving from a more neutral concept of the grave or the realm of the dead to a place often associated with punishment for the unrighteous. Here are some verses that illustrate this shift:

1. **Luke 16:19-31** - The parable of the rich man and Lazarus presents Hades as a place of comfort for Lazarus and torment for the rich man, suggesting a moral division. This parable conveys the idea of Hades as a location where the righteous and the unrighteous experience different outcomes after death.

2. **Matthew 11:23** - In this verse, Jesus speaks of Capernaum being brought down to Hades, indicating that this place may be associated with judgment for those who reject righteousness.

3. **Matthew 16:18** - Jesus mentions that the gates of Hades shall not prevail against the church. While this verse does not directly describe Hades as a place of punishment, it suggests a conflict between life and death, righteousness and sin, which impacts our understanding of Hades.

4. **Revelation 20:13-14** - The final judgment scene describes death and Hades being thrown into the lake of fire, which highlights the association of Hades with judgment for the unrighteous at the end of times.

These illustrations, among others in the New Testament, contribute to a developing understanding of Hades as a place with moral implications, particularly in relation to the fate of the unrighteous. It's important to approach these interpretations with an awareness of the cultural and theological contexts in which they were written.
