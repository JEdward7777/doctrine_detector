  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-supported explanation of how the New Testament depicts a shift in the understanding of Hades, moving towards associating it with punishment for the unrighteous. The student accurately references relevant verses such as Luke 16:19-31, Matthew 11:23, Matthew 16:18, and Revelation 20:13-14 to make their case. The explanation is clear and effectively conveys the theological shift regarding Hades in the New Testament. However, the response could benefit from further theological depth and integration of doctrinal implications related to the concept of Hades and judgment."
