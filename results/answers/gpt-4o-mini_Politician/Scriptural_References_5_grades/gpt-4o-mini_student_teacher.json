  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer supported by relevant New Testament verses that indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades. They have effectively shown how these verses point to Hades as a place associated with punishment for the unrighteous. The student also appropriately acknowledged the importance of considering cultural and theological contexts in interpreting these verses. However, the reference answer from the teacher specifically highlighted Luke 16:23 and Luke 23:43 as key verses indicating the shift, which the student did not focus on exclusively. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a good understanding of the topic."
