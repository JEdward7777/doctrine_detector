  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the shift in the New Testament understanding of Hades from a neutral place to one associated with punishment for the unrighteous. They provide relevant textual evidence from Luke 16:19-31, Matthew 11:23, Matthew 16:18, and Revelation 20:13-14 to support their claim. Additionally, they acknowledge the importance of considering the cultural and theological contexts of these interpretations. While the reference answer provides a specific verse depicting Hades as a place for the unrighteous, the student's answer offers a more comprehensive analysis of the evolving understanding of Hades in the New Testament."
