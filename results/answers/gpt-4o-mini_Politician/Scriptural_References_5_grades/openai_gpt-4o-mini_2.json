  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of various New Testament verses that demonstrate the shift in understanding Hades as a place with moral implications, particularly for the unrighteous. The incorporation of additional verses and explanation of their significance enriches the understanding of Hades within Christian eschatology. The response effectively addresses the concern by expanding on scriptural evidence and offering insightful interpretations. A very well-done explanation from a Christian worldview perspective."
