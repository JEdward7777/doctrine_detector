  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that effectively connects the biblical principles of humility and exaltation in the context of 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11. The student's analysis and interpretation of the passages demonstrate a clear understanding of how humility precedes exaltation in the Christian faith. However, the student included additional insights and explanations beyond what was specifically requested in the reference answer, which is why the grade is slightly lower than perfect."
