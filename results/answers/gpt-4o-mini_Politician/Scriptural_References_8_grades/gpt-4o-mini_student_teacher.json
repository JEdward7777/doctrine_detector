  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thorough exploration of key scriptural references supporting the concept of being blameless, offering insightful interpretations and practical guidance for Christian living. The student effectively connected the chosen verses to the idea of maintaining a blameless character in various aspects of life. However, the response could have been enhanced by directly referencing the verses specified in the teacher's reference answer (1 Thessalonians 2:10, 2 Peter 3:14, Philippians 2:15) to align more closely with the given concern. Overall, a strong and well-supported answer deserving of a high grade."
