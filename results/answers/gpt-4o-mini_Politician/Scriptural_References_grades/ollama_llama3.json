  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80%\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the book and chapter of the Bible where God is referred to as \"Almighty\" in relation to Abraham, which aligns with the concern of knowing biblical references that deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises. However, it would be even stronger if the response had explicitly mentioned how this reference relates to God's power and sovereignty, as emphasized by the title \"El Shaddai.\" Additionally, providing a brief explanation or application of what this means for our understanding of God could further enhance the response. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good foundation in biblical knowledge and shows potential for growth in its application and significance."
