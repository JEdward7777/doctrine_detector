  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid selection of Bible verses emphasizing the theme of restoration and has offered insightful explanations for each. The references chosen align well with the theme and are explained in a thoughtful and coherent manner. The student effectively highlights the various aspects of restoration portrayed in the verses. However, there is room for improvement in connecting these verses more explicitly to the overarching narrative of God's overarching plan for restoration through Jesus Christ. Additionally, incorporating how these verses relate to the broader biblical context of God's redemptive work could enhance the depth of the analysis. Overall, a strong effort with room for additional theological depth."
