2. **Isaiah 61:3**: "And provide for those who grieve in Zion— to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair."  
   - Here, restoration is depicted as a transformative process that replaces sorrow and mourning with joy and praise, showcasing God's compassion and restorative power in the lives of those who are suffering.

3. **Joel 2:25**: “I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten…”  
   - This verse illustrates divine assurance of restoring what has been lost or damaged. It signifies hope for recovery from past hardships and calamities, emphasizing that restoration can encompass both emotional and material aspects of life.

4. **2 Corinthians 5:17**: "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!"  
   - This verse underscores the concept of spiritual restoration and renewal in Christ, indicating that through faith, individuals can experience a complete transformation and a new beginning.

5. **Romans 8:28**: "And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."  
   - While this verse doesn’t mention restoration explicitly, it communicates a message of hope and assurance that even amid difficulties, God orchestrates outcomes for overall good, suggesting a focus on eventual restoration and healing.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student has provided a solid selection of Bible verses emphasizing the theme of restoration and has offered insightful explanations for each. The references chosen align well with the theme and are explained in a thoughtful and coherent manner. The student effectively highlights the various aspects of restoration portrayed in the verses. However, there is room for improvement in connecting these verses more explicitly to the overarching narrative of God's overarching plan for restoration through Jesus Christ. Additionally, incorporating how these verses relate to the broader biblical context of God's redemptive work could enhance the depth of the analysis. Overall, a strong effort with room for additional theological depth.
