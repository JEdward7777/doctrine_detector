  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of several key Bible verses emphasizing the theme of restoration. The verses chosen effectively illustrate different aspects of restoration in the context of hope, renewal, and healing. The explanation of each verse demonstrates a strong understanding of the theme and its significance in the Christian faith journey. However, the student could have included the verses Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6 as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer to further strengthen the scriptural support for the concept of restoration. Overall, it was a well-constructed response with room for minor improvement."
