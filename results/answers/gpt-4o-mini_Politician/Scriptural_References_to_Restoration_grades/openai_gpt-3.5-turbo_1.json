The inclusion of additional verses such as Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6 further strengthens the argument for God's promise of restoration and healing. The response effectively addresses the concern by showcasing strong scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey from a Christian worldview."
