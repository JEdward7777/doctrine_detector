  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and comprehensive explanation of a seared conscience in the biblical context, emphasizing its implications for believers. However, the answer lacked specificity in addressing the concern by not directly connecting the importance of recognizing one's conscience for spiritual vigilance and integrity in a believer's life. The response could have been improved by explicitly tying in the significance of self-reflection and sensitivity to moral guidance in light of the given concern."
