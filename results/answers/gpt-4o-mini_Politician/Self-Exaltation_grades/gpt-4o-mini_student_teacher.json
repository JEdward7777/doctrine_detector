  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough answer citing relevant biblical teachings on the dangers of exalting oneself. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the biblical perspective on pride and its consequences. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by focusing more directly on the specified concern of recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. By emphasizing the spiritual aspect of separation from God due to pride, the student could align their response more closely with the Christian worldview."
