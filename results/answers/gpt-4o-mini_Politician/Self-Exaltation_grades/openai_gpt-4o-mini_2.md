## [Answer](../Self-Exaltation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
According to biblical teachings, exalting oneself can lead to several dangers, which are often emphasized in scripture. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Pride and Arrogance**: The Bible frequently cautions against pride. Proverbs 16:18 states, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." This suggests that self-exaltation can lead to one's downfall and separation from others.

2. **Loss of Humility**: Humility is a valued virtue in many religious teachings. Philippians 2:3 encourages individuals to "do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves." Exalting oneself can undermine the importance of humility and the equitable treatment of others.

3. **Disconnection from Community**: Exalting oneself can create divisions between individuals and discourage collaboration and unity. Romans 12:3 advises believers not to think of themselves more highly than they ought but rather to think of themselves with sober judgment.

4. **Spiritual Consequences**: Many scriptures indicate that those who lift themselves up may ultimately be humbled. Luke 14:11 states, "For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted." This reflects a moral and spiritual principle regarding the right posture before God and others.

5. **Neglect of Service**: Exalting oneself may lead to a focus on personal gain rather than serving others. Jesus modeled servanthood, stating in Mark 10:44-45, “whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve.”

In summary, biblical teachings suggest that self-exaltation can foster pride, hinder community, create spiritual pitfalls, and detract from the call to humility and service. It is encouraged to practice self-reflection and to strive towards a disposition of humility that uplifts others as well.
