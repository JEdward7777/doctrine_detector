It correctly highlights the Pharisees' emphasis on cultural preservation, religious fidelity, historical experiences, ritual purity, and the socio-political context of the time. The answer shows a good understanding of the Pharisees' motivations and concerns, backed up with relevant information. However, tying these reasons back to Scripture or theological implications would have enhanced the answer further and strengthened its connection to a Christian worldview."
