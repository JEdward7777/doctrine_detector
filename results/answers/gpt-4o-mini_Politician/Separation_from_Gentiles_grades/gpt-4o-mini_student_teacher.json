  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer at 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive and well-explained response to the question, their answer goes beyond the specified concern provided by the teacher. The student's answer delves into various aspects such as historical experiences, socio-political context, and ritual purity, which, although relevant, are not directly connected to the concern of upholding faith in a diverse cultural context as specified. However, the student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the Pharisees' motivations and the broader implications of their actions."
