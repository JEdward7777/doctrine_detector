The Pharisees, a religious and political group in ancient Judaism, were deeply concerned with maintaining the distinct identity and purity of the Jewish people. Their emphasis on the Torah and adherence to Jewish law was fundamental to their beliefs. Here are a few reasons why they were particularly focused on separating the Jewish community from Gentiles (non-Jews):

1. **Cultural Preservation**: The Pharisees believed that following Jewish laws and practices was essential for preserving their unique cultural and religious identity. Interacting closely with Gentiles could lead to the adoption of foreign customs and practices, which they viewed as a potential threat to their traditions.

2. **Religious Fidelity**: The Torah outlines specific laws and commandments that govern not only religious practices but also daily life. The Pharisees aimed to ensure that the Jewish people remained faithful to these laws. They feared that mingling with Gentiles might lead to the erosion of religious observance.

3. **Historical Experience**: Throughout their history, the Jewish people had faced various challenges, including exile and persecution. Experiences of cultural assimilation and loss of identity were profound, and the Pharisees sought to prevent a repeat of these circumstances by advocating for separation.

4. **Ritual Purity**: In Jewish tradition, certain interactions, particularly with those considered 'unclean,' could affect a person's status of ritual purity. The Pharisees emphasized these laws to maintain a community that was spiritually and morally aligned with their religious values.

5. **Socio-Political Context**: The era in which the Pharisees operated was marked by foreign domination and political instability. Preserving Jewish identity and community cohesion was a means of resistance against outside influences that might seek to disrupt their way of life.

Overall, the Pharisees' concern with separating Jewish people from Gentiles stemmed from their commitment to preserving religious and cultural identity, ensuring fidelity to the Torah, and upholding communal integrity. This complex interplay of faith, culture, and historical context shaped their approach to community relations during that time.
