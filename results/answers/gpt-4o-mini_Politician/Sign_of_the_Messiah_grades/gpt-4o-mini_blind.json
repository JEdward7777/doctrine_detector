  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough analysis of the significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke's Gospel. The student effectively highlights the accessibility of the message, the fulfillment of prophecy, the symbolism of the manger, the invitation to witness, and the theme of joy and celebration. The inclusion of both theological and cultural perspectives adds depth to the response. However, to improve, the answer could have connected these points more explicitly to the Christian worldview and emphasized the unique role of the shepherds in the narrative as recipients of the divine announcement."
