However, the student's response lacks a direct connection to recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs, which was the specified concern. The answer could have been improved by emphasizing the direct correlation between the sign and God's plan of fulfillment through the birth of Jesus as the Messiah."
