  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-explained answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of anointing in the context of Old Testament priests, kings, and prophets. They have effectively highlighted how anointing symbolized the selection, empowerment, and divine approval for specific leadership roles. The student's explanation shows a solid understanding of the biblical perspective on anointing and its implications for biblical leadership. However, the student could have linked the importance of anointing more explicitly to the empowerment by God for these roles, as stated in the teacher's reference answer."
