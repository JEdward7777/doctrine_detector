The theological implications, cultural sensitivity, and liturgical context are well-addressed. However, it would have been beneficial to include a stronger emphasis on the biblical context and doctrinal significance of 'Shaddai' as a title for God, as this is crucial in a Christian worldview. Additionally, tying the discussion back to how this translation choice aligns with biblical teachings on the nature and character of God could have strengthened the answer further."
