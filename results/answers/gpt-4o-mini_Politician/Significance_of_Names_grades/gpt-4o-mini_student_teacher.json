  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and thoughtful response in addressing the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. They effectively discussed theological implications, cultural sensitivity, liturgical context, inclusivity, and interpretive flexibility. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the importance of using 'Shaddai' as a title to deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith, as emphasized in the reference answer."
