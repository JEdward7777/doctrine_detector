  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological implications of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title, emphasizing God's attributes and power. The discussion of cultural sensitivity, liturgical context, inclusivity, and interpretive flexibility also shows a thoughtful consideration of how this translation can foster greater respect and understanding among diverse audiences.\n\nHowever, to deepen our understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith, it would be beneficial to explore more explicitly how this title reveals God's nature as a relational Being who desires a personal connection with humanity. While the response touches on this aspect, it could be further developed to provide a richer theological reflection.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title and demonstrates a strong grasp of relevant theological concepts. With some additional attention to exploring God's relational nature, this grade could potentially reach 90-100%."
