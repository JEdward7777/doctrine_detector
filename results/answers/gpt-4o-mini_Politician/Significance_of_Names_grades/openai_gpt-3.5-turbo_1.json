It effectively ties back to the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith by pointing out how using 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes of omnipotence and strength. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect this understanding to the Christian faith context throughout the response."
