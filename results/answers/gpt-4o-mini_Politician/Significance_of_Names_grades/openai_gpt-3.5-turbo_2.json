It appropriately addresses the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith by highlighting how using 'Shaddai' as a title can emphasize God's omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name underscores a personal relationship with God. The response effectively integrates a Christian worldview perspective in evaluating the translation choice."
