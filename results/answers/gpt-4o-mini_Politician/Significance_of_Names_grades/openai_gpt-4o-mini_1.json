  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of why translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name is significant, touching on theological implications, cultural sensitivity, liturgical context, inclusivity, and interpretive flexibility. It effectively demonstrates how emphasizing the title can deepen understanding of God's attributes while allowing for a more relational aspect in the Christian faith. The integration of a Christian worldview is well articulated, earning a high grade."
