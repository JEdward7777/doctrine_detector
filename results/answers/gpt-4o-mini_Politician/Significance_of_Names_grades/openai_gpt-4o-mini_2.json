The understanding of how this translation choice deepens the understanding of God's attributes aligns well with the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. The response effectively demonstrates how using 'Shaddai' as a title can enrich interpretations and foster respectful engagement within diverse communities."
