The student demonstrates a good understanding of the event and its implications. However, to improve the grade, the response could include more direct references to specific biblical passages related to Pentecost, emphasizing the scriptural foundation of the points made. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the ongoing impact of Pentecost on the Christian Church and individual believers could enhance the overall theological reflection."
