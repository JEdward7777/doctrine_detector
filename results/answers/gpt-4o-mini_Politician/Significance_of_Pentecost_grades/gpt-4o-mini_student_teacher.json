  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-organized answer that effectively addresses the significance of the Day of Pentecost in the New Testament. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the event's historical and theological importance, highlighting key aspects such as the fulfillment of prophecy, empowerment for mission, foundation of the church, demonstration of God's presence, and theological significance. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the central concern of the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a solid response that could benefit from tighter alignment with the specified concern."
