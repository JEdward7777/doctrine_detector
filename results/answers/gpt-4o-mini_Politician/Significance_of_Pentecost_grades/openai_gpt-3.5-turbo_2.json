It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how the Holy Spirit empowered the apostles for ministry and fulfilled Jesus' promise. The integration of Biblical references and theological analysis demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview. The response could be further enhanced by explicitly connecting the theological significance of Pentecost to the ongoing presence and work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers today."
