The student effectively highlights the relationship between the tetrarchs and Roman authority, as well as the decentralized nature of power in the region. The response could be strengthened by connecting these governance structures explicitly to the biblical narratives involving figures such as Herod Antipas and the impact on Jesus' ministry within this political context. Overall, well done."
