The explanation is well-structured, highlighting key points such as the validation of authority, symbol of hope and compassion, revelation of Kingdom values, encouragement of faith, and narrative function of miracles in the New Testament. The student's explanation aligns well with Christian beliefs regarding the purpose and significance of signs and miracles in confirming the divine nature of Jesus and the apostles. However, the answer could have further emphasized the centrality of faith in receiving and understanding these signs and miracles in line with Christian doctrine."
