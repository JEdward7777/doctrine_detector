  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough and thoughtful exploration of the role of signs and miracles in validating divine authority, conveying hope and compassion, revealing Kingdom values, encouraging faith, and serving a narrative function. The integration of diverse perspectives and the emphasis on respectful dialogue add depth to the analysis. However, the student's answer could further emphasize the central role of signs and miracles as validations of God's power and authority in relation to the concern of examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation."
