  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85%\n\nComment:\n\nThis response receives an excellent score for its comprehensive exploration of the significance of signs and miracles in the context of Jesus and the apostles. The author provides a thorough analysis of how these events validated authority, symbolized hope and compassion, revealed Kingdom values, encouraged faith, and served a narrative function. The discussion is well-organized, and the connections made between these phenomena are thoughtful and insightful.\n\nWhile the response does not directly address the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation as specified in the concern, it indirectly explores this topic by highlighting how signs and miracles can inspire belief and faith in God's power and presence. The author also acknowledges the importance of approaching these events with sensitivity to diverse beliefs and perspectives.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be even more explicitly connected to the concern about examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. However, the overall quality and depth of the discussion are impressive, making this an excellent response."
