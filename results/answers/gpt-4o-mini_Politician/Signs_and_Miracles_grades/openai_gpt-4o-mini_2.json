  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough analysis of the role of signs and miracles in the context of Jesus and the apostles, addressing the concern of faith, signs, and God's revelation effectively from a Christian worldview. The points presented are well-supported with scriptural references and demonstrate a deep understanding of the significance of miracles in affirming divine authority and conveying messages of hope and faith. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly tying each point back to the central theme of faith and God's revelation, but overall, it offers a comprehensive and insightful perspective on the topic."
