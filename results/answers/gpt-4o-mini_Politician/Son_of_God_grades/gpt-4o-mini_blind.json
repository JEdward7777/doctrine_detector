The student correctly articulates the unique, divine sonship of Jesus as the Son of God and the collective, adoptive relationship of believers as sons of God.\n2. The student provides a clear explanation of the theological implications of each term and how they relate to Christian theology.\n3. The answer demonstrates an understanding of the central role of Jesus in salvation history and the foundational nature of His mission, life, death, and resurrection.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n1. The student could strengthen their answer by referencing specific biblical passages that highlight the distinctions between \"Son of God\" and \"sons of God,\" grounding their argument in scriptural support.\n2. Including a discussion on the concept of Jesus as the Second Person of the Trinity and the implications of His unique divine nature would enhance the theological depth of the response.\n\nOverall, this is a solid answer that shows a good understanding of the topic."
