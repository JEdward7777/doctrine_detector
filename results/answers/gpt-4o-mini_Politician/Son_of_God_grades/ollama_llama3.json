  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the distinction between \"Son of God\" and \"sons of God,\" but could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation. The answer provided does not fully capture the unique aspects of Jesus' relationship with God, as mentioned in the concern about clarity in theological discussions. The response also lacks specific biblical references to support its claims, which would further strengthen its argument. Overall, while the response is generally clear and concise, it could benefit from more depth and Biblical support to fully address the concern about avoiding confusion in theological discussions."
