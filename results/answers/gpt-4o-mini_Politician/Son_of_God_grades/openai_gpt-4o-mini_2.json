  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" applied to Jesus and the term \"sons of God\" used for believers. It effectively addresses the concern of clarity in theological discussions by clearly outlining the unique nature of Jesus' relationship with God the Father and the collective relationship believers have with God through faith in Christ. The response is well-supported, coherent, and demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian theology."
