  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, considering various scholarly perspectives. The answer acknowledges the diversity of views and presents them fairly. It would have been beneficial to include a bit more emphasis on the doctrinal implications of each interpretation from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, delving deeper into the biblical context and theology would have strengthened the analysis. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological exploration."
