  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed and well-organized overview of various interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, they could improve by explicitly aligning the presented interpretations with the specific concern of understanding biblical interpretation. The student could have analyzed how each interpretation impacts the overall understanding of the passage and its underlying message. However, the student's grasp of the diverse viewpoints and their implications is commendable and reflects a deeper engagement with the text."
