  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies that different interpretations exist for the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis, which is relevant to understanding biblical interpretation. However, it does not engage with any specific interpretation or provide further insight into how these varying perspectives can deepen our understanding of the scripture passage. A higher grade would be earned if the response offered a more nuanced exploration of the different interpretations and their implications for grasping the meaning of scripture passages.\n\nThe given answer receives an 80 because it correctly acknowledges that various interpretations exist, but does not go beyond providing a superficial summary."
