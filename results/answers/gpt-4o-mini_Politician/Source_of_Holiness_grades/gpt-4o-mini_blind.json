While the response covers important points, there are some doctrinal nuances that could be further emphasized, such as the role of grace in the process of sanctification and the distinction between the universal call to holiness and the formal recognition of saints. Additionally, the mention of \"veneration\" could have been elaborated on to clarify the difference between the honor given to saints and the worship due to God alone."
