  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the process of becoming a saint in the Christian faith, mentioning important aspects such as virtuous living, canonization, martyrdom, and veneration. However, the student's answer did not adequately address the concern about the central role of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of holiness for believers becoming saints. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to emphasize that believers become saints not solely through their actions or Church recognition, but ultimately through their faith in Jesus Christ. The student's answer could have been improved by more explicitly stating this foundational belief."
