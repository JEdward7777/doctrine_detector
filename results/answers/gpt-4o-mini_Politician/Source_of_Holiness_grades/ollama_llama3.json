  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a general overview of the process of becoming a saint in Christianity, highlighting the importance of living a faithful life, the role of canonization, martyrdom, and veneration. It also acknowledges that all believers are considered \"saints\" in some sense due to their baptismal union with Christ. The response is well-organized and easy to follow.\n\nHowever, while it does touch on the idea that faith plays a central role in holiness, it does not explicitly state that it is the source of holiness, as required by the concern. While it mentions Jesus' saving work making believers holy, this is framed as part of the process of becoming a saint rather than the sole source of holiness.\n\nTo fully address the concern and earn a higher grade, the response could be revised to emphasize that faith in Jesus Christ is not only a necessary condition for sanctification but also the sufficient source of holiness."
