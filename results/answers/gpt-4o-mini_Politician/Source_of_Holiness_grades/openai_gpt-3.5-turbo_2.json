The response ties in well with the Christian doctrine that holiness comes from Christ's saving work rather than individual deeds. It provides a comprehensive overview of the process of becoming a saint in Christianity and effectively reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the detailed process of becoming a saint with the overarching idea that it is ultimately faith in Christ that sanctifies believers."
