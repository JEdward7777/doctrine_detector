  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer with a 85.\n\nThe student provided a thorough explanation of the differences between spiritual and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching, covering aspects such as the nature of authority, purpose and focus, accountability, and the interrelationship between the two forms of authority. They referenced relevant Bible passages to support their points and demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic.\n\nHowever, the student's answer lacked a direct mention of Ephesians 6:12, which is the specific reference given in the teacher's answer. While the student's response was detailed and well-structured, aligning more closely with the specified concern would have further strengthened their answer and demonstrated a deeper engagement with the biblical text provided."
