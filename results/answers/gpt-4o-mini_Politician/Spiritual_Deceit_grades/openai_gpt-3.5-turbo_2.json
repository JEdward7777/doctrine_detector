The connection between demons, idolatry, and the truth of Yahweh as the one true God is well-articulated. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly highlighting the importance of relying on prayer, scripture, and the Holy Spirit for discernment in recognizing and resisting such deceptive influences. Nonetheless, it effectively communicates a Christian worldview on the topic."
