  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the implications of the phrase \"spiritual gifts\" as described in the Bible. They have highlighted important aspects such as diversity of abilities, community and interdependence, empowerment, encouragement of service, growth and development, acceptance of variation, spiritual discernment, and potential for conflict. However, the student's response lacks a clear emphasis on the central Christian perspective that spiritual gifts are given by the Holy Spirit for the purpose of building up the church and serving others in love. To improve the grade, the student should tie their points back to this central Christian understanding and emphasize the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit."
