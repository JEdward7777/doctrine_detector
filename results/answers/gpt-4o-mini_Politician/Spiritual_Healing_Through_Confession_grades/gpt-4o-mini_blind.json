However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the foundational aspect of confession being rooted in seeking forgiveness and reconciliation with God. The response focuses more on the interpersonal benefits of confession rather than its primary purpose in spiritual healing. Additionally, it could have included more scriptural references or theological insights to strengthen the argument from a Christian worldview."
