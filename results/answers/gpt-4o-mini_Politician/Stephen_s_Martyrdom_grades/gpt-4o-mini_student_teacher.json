  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive analysis of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church, they have included additional points beyond the scope of the concern provided. The student effectively discusses martyrdom, faith, persecution, unity, growth of the church, the role of deacons, and courage. However, the initial concern specifically focuses on reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. \n\nThe student's response is well-written, demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic, and includes insightful points. However, for a higher grade, the student could have more directly addressed the concern provided and linked their analysis more explicitly to the concept of discipleship and faithfulness in the face of persecution as outlined in the reference answer."
