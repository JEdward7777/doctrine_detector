It effectively addresses the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution from a Christian worldview. The connection to broader themes within the early Christian church is well-developed, demonstrating a strong understanding of the significance of Stephen's martyrdom."
