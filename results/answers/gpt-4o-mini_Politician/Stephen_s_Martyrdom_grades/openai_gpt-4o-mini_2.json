  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of the significance of Stephen's stoning in relation to martyrdom, persecution, unity, church growth, the role of deacons, and the importance of courage and faith. It effectively addresses the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution from a Christian worldview, emphasizing the commitment and resilience of early believers. The response could be further strengthened by directly tying each point back to the theme of faithfulness and discipleship, but overall, it provides a thorough evaluation of the given concern."
