  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated response that effectively addresses the concern regarding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. They correctly reference relevant biblical passages and highlight the shift in perspective from the Old Testament to the New Testament, particularly emphasizing Jesus' demonstration of mercy and forgiveness. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of interpreting biblical principles in a contemporary context while maintaining respect for the Christian worldview. However, there could have been a more explicit connection back to God's ultimate justice and mercy in relation to the practice of stoning for adultery."
