  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical context surrounding stoning as a punishment for adultery, including the shift from Old Testament laws to New Testament teachings emphasizing mercy and forgiveness. The writer also recognizes the importance of balancing God's justice with His mercy in His commandments. However, the response could be improved by providing more depth and analysis of the biblical passages discussed, particularly regarding the implications of Jesus' interaction with the woman caught in adultery for understanding God's justice and mercy."
