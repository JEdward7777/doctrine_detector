It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how Jesus demonstrated God's mercy and forgiveness in contrast to the strict legalistic approach of the Old Testament laws. The response could have deepened the discussion by further exploring how the concept of mercy and justice intersects in Christian theology and how believers are called to embody these principles in their lives. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments from a Christian worldview."
