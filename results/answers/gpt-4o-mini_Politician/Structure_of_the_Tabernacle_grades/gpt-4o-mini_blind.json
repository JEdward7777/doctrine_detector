  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the two main sections of the tabernacle, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place. The student correctly identifies the key items located in each section and their significance in the worship system of the Israelites. The inclusion of details such as the replacement of the showbread every Sabbath and the annual entrance of the High Priest into the Most Holy Place on Yom Kippur demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. Well done!"
