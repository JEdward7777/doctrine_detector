They also highlighted the significance of each item in worship, showing a good understanding of the components' importance in the relationship between God and His people. The student's response aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the sacred nature of the tabernacle and its role in facilitating worship. However, the student's answer could have been improved by mentioning the specific location of the altar for burning incense in the Holy Place, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
