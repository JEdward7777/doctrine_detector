## [Answer](../Structure_of_the_Tabernacle.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Tabernacle, as described in the Hebrew Bible, was composed of two main sections: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place (or Holy of Holies).

1. **Holy Place**: This section was accessible by the priests and contained several important items:
   - **The Table of Showbread**: This table held twelve loaves of bread, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, which were replaced every Sabbath.
   - **The Golden Lampstand (Menorah)**: This provided light and symbolized the presence of God.
   - **The Altar of Incense**: This altar was used for burning incense, which represented the prayers of the people.

2. **Most Holy Place (Holy of Holies)**: This inner sanctuary was considered the dwelling place of God and could only be entered by the High Priest once a year on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement). The specific item located here was:
   - **The Ark of the Covenant**: This sacred chest contained the tablets of the Ten Commandments and symbolized God's covenant with His people. It was covered by the Mercy Seat, where God's presence was believed to be especially manifested.

Collectively, these sections and their contents served as vital components of the worship system and the relationship between God and the Israelites.
