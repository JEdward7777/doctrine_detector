It effectively breaks down various aspects of the metaphor and connects them to the Christian faith. The explanation is clear, well-structured, and deeply reflective. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the response could have included more direct references to biblical passages that mention Jesus as the cornerstone (e.g., Ephesians 2:20, 1 Peter 2:6). Integrating more scriptural support would further strengthen the theological foundation of the analysis. Nonetheless, the interpretation provided demonstrates a solid understanding of the metaphor and its implications for the relationship between Jesus and His followers."
