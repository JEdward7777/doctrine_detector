  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student's answer thoroughly explores the various dimensions of the metaphor of the cornerstone in illustrating the relationship between Jesus and His followers, the concern provided focuses specifically on how understanding this relationship can help believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example. The student's response does touch upon this by mentioning alignment with Jesus's teachings and reflecting His character, but much of the focus is on the broader implications and symbolism of the cornerstone metaphor.\n\nThe student demonstrates a deep understanding of the metaphor and offers insightful interpretations, but could improve by directly addressing how this understanding can practically help believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example.\n\nOverall, the student's answer is comprehensive, well-analyzed, and thought-provoking, earning a high grade."
