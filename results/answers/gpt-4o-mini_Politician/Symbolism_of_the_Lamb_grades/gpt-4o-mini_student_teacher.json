  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and well-explained answer that effectively delves into the symbolism of the lamb in biblical sacrifices and its significance in the concept of atonement. They have accurately connected the innocence and purity of the lamb with the idea of atonement, referencing both Old Testament practices and Christian theology. The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and effectively explored the deeper implications of the symbolism of the lamb in the context of atonement. However, there is some room for improvement in directly addressing the specific concern raised by the teacher and focusing more on the core idea presented in the reference answer."
