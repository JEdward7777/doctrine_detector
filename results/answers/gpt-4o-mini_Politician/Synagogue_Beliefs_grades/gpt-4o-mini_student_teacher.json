  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of the various ways in which the term \"synagogue\" can be understood beyond just the physical building. They highlighted the community aspect, worship significance, cultural identity, and educational functions of a synagogue. However, the student missed the key point emphasized in the reference answer, which is the figurative aspect of the term 'synagogue' referring to the group of people gathered for worship. Encouraging the student to also consider the spiritual and communal significance of the term 'synagogue' as indicated in the reference answer would enhance their response."
