However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused specifically on the primary purpose of the temple as a place for worship and sacrifice, as explained in the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the additional details enhance the overall understanding, staying more closely aligned with the core purpose would have strengthened the response."
