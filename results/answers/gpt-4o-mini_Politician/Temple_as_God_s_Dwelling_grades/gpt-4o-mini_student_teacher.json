  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that explores the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments. They have effectively highlighted the significance of the temple in relation to God's presence among His people, and their discussion on the evolution of this concept over time is insightful. The student's inclusion of relevant scripture references adds depth to their response. However, deducting some points for not directly summarizing the teacher's reference answer, which briefly and succinctly captures the core theological implications of God dwelling among His people."
