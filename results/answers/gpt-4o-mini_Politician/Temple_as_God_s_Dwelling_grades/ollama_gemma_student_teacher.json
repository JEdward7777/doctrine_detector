  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and comprehensive response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments from a Christian perspective. The student clearly articulates the evolving understanding of the temple, from its physical manifestation in the Old Testament to its spiritual and relational significance in the New Testament. The inclusion of relevant references from scripture adds credibility to the response."
