  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid and accurate explanation of how Jesus responded to the temptations presented by Satan. The student effectively referenced specific passages from the Gospels and highlighted the core principles demonstrated by Jesus during these temptations. The response aligns well with Christian doctrine and emphasizes the importance of spiritual principles over worldly temptations. A minor improvement could be to further emphasize the deity of Christ in His responses to Satan's temptations. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound answer."
