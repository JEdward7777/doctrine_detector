## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the biblical narrative, Jesus responded to the temptations presented by Satan, as described in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Each temptation involved an appeal to physical needs, power, and vanity. Jesus countered each temptation with references from scripture, emphasizing principles such as faith, humility, and the importance of spiritual over physical sustenance.

1. **Turning Stones to Bread**: When tempted to turn stones into bread to satisfy His hunger, Jesus replied, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4). This response highlights the importance of spiritual nourishment.

2. **Throwing Himself from the Temple**: Satan tempted Him to throw Himself from the pinnacle of the temple, suggesting that angels would protect Him. Jesus responded, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test" (Matthew 4:7), emphasizing the need for faith without demanding miraculous signs.

3. **Worshiping Satan for Power**: Finally, Satan offered Jesus the kingdoms of the world in exchange for worship. Jesus replied, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve" (Matthew 4:10), reinforcing the commitment to serve God above all else.

Through these responses, Jesus demonstrated reliance on scripture and a commitment to His divine mission, rejecting both the material and the prideful temptations presented to Him.
