  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of what it means to \"tempt God\" and how it can lead to consequences according to Biblical teaching, their answer focused more on the broader concept of testing and trusting God rather than directly addressing the seriousness of disobeying God and the potential divine punishment that can result. The answer lacked a strong emphasis on the direct disobedience aspect highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to include more specific examples of divine punishment or consequences related to tempting God would have strengthened their answer."
