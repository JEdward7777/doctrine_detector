  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response only mentions two terms, \"communion\" and \"Last Supper\", which is not sufficient to demonstrate an understanding of the various terms used within Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper. While it does acknowledge the existence of different terms, it does not provide a comprehensive overview like the given answer does. The concern is to understand the different terms, but this response only scratches the surface."
