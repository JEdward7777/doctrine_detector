However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the alternatives listed do not fully capture the unique biblical and theological significance of the deacon's role within the church. The answer could have been improved by including terms that specifically reflect the biblical understanding of deacons as servants who are appointed to a specific ministry of service within the church, such as \"Servant-leader\" or \"Deaconate Servant.\" Emphasizing the scriptural basis for the term would have enhanced the response."
