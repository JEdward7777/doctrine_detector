  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nThe student provided thoughtful alternative terms for \"deacon\" that consider the different aspects of the role within the church. The alternatives offered demonstrate an understanding of the varying functions and responsibilities that a deacon may have. Additionally, the student emphasized the importance of sensitivity to the beliefs and practices of the community when selecting terminology. \n\nHowever, the student's answer may have been more effective if it included simpler and more commonly used terms like \"church worker\" or \"church servant\" as provided in the reference answer from the teacher. These terms are more direct and commonly understood in the context of church service roles. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrated good critical thinking skills and an awareness of the importance of respectful and inclusive language within religious communities."
