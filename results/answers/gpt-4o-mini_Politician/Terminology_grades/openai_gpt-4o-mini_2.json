  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and comprehensive list of alternative terms for \"deacon\" that consider the specific roles and contexts within religious and community frameworks. The suggestions align well with the concern of recognizing service roles within the church, showing sensitivity and respect for the beliefs and practices of different groups. The inclusion of terms like \"Minister of Service\" and \"Support Minister\" reflects an understanding of the multifaceted nature of the deacon's role in serving and supporting the church community. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly referencing Christian principles or biblical roles associated with service within the church."
