2. **Church Officer** – A more general term that signifies a position of responsibility within a church.
3. **Lay Leader** – Highlights the non-clerical status of the individual while indicating leadership.
4. **Community Volunteer** – Focuses on the individual's commitment to community service.
5. **Spiritual Guide** – Places emphasis on the supportive and guiding aspects of the role.
6. **Helper** – A simple, inclusive designation without formal connotations.
