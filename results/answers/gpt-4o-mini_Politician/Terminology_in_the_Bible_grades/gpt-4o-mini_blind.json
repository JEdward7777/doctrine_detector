  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies the three terms commonly used to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible - \"Israelites,\" \"Hebrews,\" and \"Jews.\" The answer shows awareness of the historical and cultural significance of these terms. However, to improve the grade, additional discussion on the theological implications of these terms in relation to God's covenant with His chosen people could have been included."
