  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the concern that recognizing this principle is crucial for maintaining a proper relationship with God. It effectively conveys that testing God can be seen as trying to manipulate or control Him, which goes against acknowledging His sovereignty and holiness. The language used is also respectful and acknowledges diverse perspectives on the issue.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response could be more nuanced in its exploration of the issue. For example, it does not explicitly address the idea that testing God can be a human tendency, rooted in fear or insecurity, rather than a deliberate attempt to manipulate Him. Additionally, while it mentions the importance of faith and humility, it does not provide specific examples or biblical support for these principles.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and effectively communicates the principle that putting God to the test is considered wrong. With some additional development and support, it could be even more effective in conveying this message."
