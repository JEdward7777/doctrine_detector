## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In a biblical context, the concepts of testing and temptation have distinct yet interconnected meanings, often reflecting different intentions and outcomes.

**Testing** is generally understood as a situation or experience that God allows or orchestrates to strengthen an individual's faith, character, or resolve. It can be seen as a form of spiritual growth or development. For example, in the biblical narrative, figures like Abraham were tested to demonstrate their faithfulness and trust in God. These tests are characterized by a divine purpose—aimed at refining believers and preparing them for their life journey.

**Temptation**, on the other hand, often refers to the enticement to sin or to stray away from God’s teachings, typically associated with the influence of evil or one's own desires. Temptations are understood as challenges that might lead one to act against their moral or spiritual convictions. The story of Jesus' temptation in the wilderness highlights this, as He faced the allure of power and security, but ultimately resisted.

In summary, while both testing and temptation can present challenges, testing is seen as a divine invitation to grow and improve, while temptation is usually perceived as a lure away from righteousness. It’s important to approach these concepts with sensitivity, recognizing the complexity of spiritual experiences that many individuals face.
