  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the concepts of testing and temptation in a biblical context. They correctly differentiate between the two, emphasizing the divine purpose behind testing and the potential for temptation to lead one astray. The response acknowledges the complexity of spiritual experiences and presents a well-rounded explanation. Integrating more scriptural references or examples could further strengthen the argument and provide additional depth to the discussion. Overall, a well-articulated and doctrinally sound response."
