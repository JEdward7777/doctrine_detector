  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful answer that demonstrates a clear understanding of the differences between testing and temptation in a biblical context. They effectively highlighted the divine purpose behind testing and the deceptive nature of temptation, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize even more strongly that temptation is not initiated by God, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, this response shows a strong grasp of the concept and aligns well with Christian beliefs."
