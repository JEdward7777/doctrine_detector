  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the command that Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven, known as the Great Commission from Matthew 28:19-20. The emphasis on spreading the message of love, compassion, and guidance aligns well with the Christian worldview. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning the call to \"make disciples of all nations\" in addition to baptizing and teaching them. Great job overall."
