Before ascending to heaven, Jesus instructed His disciples to go forth and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to observe all that He had commanded. This is often referred to as the Great Commission and can be found in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 28, verses 19-20. This command emphasizes spreading the message of love, compassion, and guidance that Jesus embodied during His ministry.

Comment: The response accurately identifies the command that Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven, known as the Great Commission from Matthew 28:19-20. The emphasis on spreading the message of love, compassion, and guidance aligns well with the Christian worldview. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning the call to "make disciples of all nations" in addition to baptizing and teaching them. Great job overall.
