## [Answer](../The_Messiah.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The terms 'Jesus' and 'Christ' are deeply interconnected within the Christian faith. 'Jesus' is a personal name derived from the Hebrew name Yeshua, which means "Yahweh saves." He is recognized as the central figure of Christianity, believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah.

'Christ,' on the other hand, is a title that comes from the Greek word 'Christos,' which translates to 'the Anointed One.' It corresponds to the Hebrew term 'Messiah.' In Christian theology, this title signifies Jesus' role as the Savior and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the coming of a Messiah.

Together, the phrase "Jesus Christ" conveys both his identity as a historical figure and his divine role in salvation. This relationship highlights the theological significance attributed to both names in the context of Christian beliefs and practices.
