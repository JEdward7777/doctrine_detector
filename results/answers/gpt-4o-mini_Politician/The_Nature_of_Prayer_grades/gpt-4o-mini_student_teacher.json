  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear distinction between praying to the one true God and talking to a false god. They provide a general description of prayer but fail to explicitly highlight the key difference in the spiritual communion and relationship with the divine between praying to the true God and engaging with a false deity. Additionally, there is a lack of emphasis on the importance of discerning between true and false gods from a Christian worldview perspective. The response would benefit from more theological clarity and specificity in addressing the concern raised."
