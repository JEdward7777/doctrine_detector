  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful and articulate interpretation of the concept of God writing His law on people's hearts in the New Covenant. They demonstrate a good understanding of the shift from external laws to internalized principles. However, their response could have been more concise and directly focused on the specific concern outlined, which is understanding the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant. The student does capture the essence of the concept well but could have linked it more explicitly to the Old Testament laws and how the New Covenant represents a change in approach."
