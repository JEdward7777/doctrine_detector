  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of believers being glorified with Christ according to the New Testament, there is some room for improvement. The answer effectively covers key theological themes such as union with Christ, spiritual transformation, future hope, participation in Christ's glory, and encouragement for perseverance. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the centrality of being transformed to be like Jesus in glorification as the reference answer indicates.\n\nOverall, the student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and effectively integrated relevant scripture references."
