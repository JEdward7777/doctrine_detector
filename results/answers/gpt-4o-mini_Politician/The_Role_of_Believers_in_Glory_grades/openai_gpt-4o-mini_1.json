It addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding the hope and future promise of glory for believers in fostering faith and perseverance. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie in the concept of believers being transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection, as mentioned in the provided answer, throughout the response to further underscore its significance."
