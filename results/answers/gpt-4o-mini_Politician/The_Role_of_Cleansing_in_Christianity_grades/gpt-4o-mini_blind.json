  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer regarding the concept of cleansing in the Bible as it relates to sin and redemption in the New Testament. The response effectively explains the transition from Old Testament ritualistic practices to the spiritual significance emphasized by Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references, such as 1 John 1:9, enhances the depth of the answer. The only minor improvement would be to further emphasize the role of Christ's atoning sacrifice in providing the ultimate cleansing from sin. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
