  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The answer provides a good overview of how figures like Moses and King David were considered 'chosen ones' in Judeo-Christian tradition. The student accurately describes their roles and qualities that led to their selection by God. However, the response could be improved by incorporating more specific references to scripture to support the points made about Moses and King David. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the sovereignty of God in His selection process and the importance of faith in His chosen individuals would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological exploration."
