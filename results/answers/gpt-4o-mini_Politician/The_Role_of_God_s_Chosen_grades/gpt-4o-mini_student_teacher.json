  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written response exploring the qualities of Moses and King David as chosen leaders, emphasizing attributes like leadership skills and dedication to God. However, the student's answer lacks a clear connection to the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders within the Christian community. To improve, the student could have explicitly tied the discussion to the idea that God's selection process is sovereign and purposeful, highlighting how leaders like Moses and David were instruments of God's divine plan for His people."
