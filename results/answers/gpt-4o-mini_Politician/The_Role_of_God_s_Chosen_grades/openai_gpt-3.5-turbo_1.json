  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive examination of the concept of being chosen by God, specifically in the cases of Moses and King David. It effectively acknowledges God's sovereignty in appointing leaders and discusses the implications for the Christian community. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively integrates scriptural references and theological concepts. The only room for improvement would be to further emphasize the unique aspects of God's selection process and how it differs from conventional human standards of leadership."
