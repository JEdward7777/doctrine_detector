  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, covering key aspects such as their selection by Jesus, their roles in spreading His teachings, and their diverse contributions to the early Christian community. The writer also highlights the apostles' models of faith, resilience, and leadership, which is a crucial aspect of their significance.\n\nHowever, while the response provides a solid overview of the apostles' importance, it could be further developed by exploring specific examples or stories from the Bible that illustrate their impact on the early church. Additionally, some minor points, such as the mention of Jesus' resurrection rather than His ascension, might not fully align with the concern.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the apostles' significance in Christian belief and ministry, and with some further development could be even more effective in conveying their importance."
