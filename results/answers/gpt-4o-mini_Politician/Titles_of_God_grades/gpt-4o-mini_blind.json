  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: This response provides a good overview of some titles used in the Bible to refer to God as 'Almighty'. The inclusion of El Shaddai, Lord God Almighty, The Almighty, and God of Hosts shows a solid understanding of the concept. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included specific references to where these titles are found in the Bible to strengthen the theological foundation of the answer. Additionally, ensuring to emphasize the significance and implications of these titles within Christian theology would further enhance the depth of the response."
