  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that highlight God's omnipotence and majesty, connecting them effectively to aspects of God's character. However, the student's answer included some titles that were not specifically focused on the term 'Almighty' as requested in the question. Encouraging the student to focus more closely on titles directly using the term 'Almighty' would improve the answer's alignment with the question's specific focus."
