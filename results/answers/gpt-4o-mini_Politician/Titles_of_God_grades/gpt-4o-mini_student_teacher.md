In the Bible, several titles highlight God’s omnipotence and majesty, often using the term 'Almighty.' Some of these include:

1. **El Shaddai** - This Hebrew name is often translated as "God Almighty" and conveys a sense of God’s all-sufficiency and power.
  
2. **Lord God Almighty** - Commonly used in both the Old and New Testaments, this title emphasizes God’s sovereignty and might over all creation.

3. **The Almighty** – Found throughout the Scriptures, this designation underscores God’s ultimate authority and dominion.

4. **God of Hosts** - This title reflects God’s command over the heavenly armies, suggesting both power and majesty.

These titles serve to remind believers of God's strength, protection, and unwavering presence in times of need. Each emphasizes different facets of God's character while maintaining respect and reverence for the divine.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that highlight God's omnipotence and majesty, connecting them effectively to aspects of God's character. However, the student's answer included some titles that were not specifically focused on the term 'Almighty' as requested in the question. Encouraging the student to focus more closely on titles directly using the term 'Almighty' would improve the answer's alignment with the question's specific focus.
