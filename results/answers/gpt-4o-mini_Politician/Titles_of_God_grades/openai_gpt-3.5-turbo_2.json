  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of several titles that highlight God's omnipotence and majesty, drawing from specific examples in the Bible and explaining the significance of each title. The answer effectively demonstrates how recognizing these titles can enhance our understanding of God's character within a Christian worldview. Great job overall, but could have included a direct reference to the specific titles mentioned in the original answer for a more direct comparison."
