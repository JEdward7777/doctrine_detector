It also provides some insightful examples to illustrate these points. While it does not explicitly mention God's established boundaries as the primary concern, it does acknowledge that all three terms involve a violation of some kind, whether moral law, social convention, or authority.\n\nThe response's strength lies in its ability to weave together various concepts and demonstrate their interconnectedness. However, it could be improved by more directly addressing the concern about recognizing the severity of transgression in one's spiritual life. For example, the response could have explored the ways in which transgressions can lead to spiritual consequences or how they affect one's relationship with God.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for further exploration and discussion, but could benefit from more explicit connection-making between the concepts and the concern about recognizing the severity of transgression."
