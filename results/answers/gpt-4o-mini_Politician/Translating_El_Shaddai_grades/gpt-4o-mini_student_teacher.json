  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for \"El Shaddai\" in different languages, demonstrating an understanding of linguistic diversity. However, the concern mentions the importance of accurately representing God's name across cultures, which the student did not fully address. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes translating \"El Shaddai\" as \"God Almighty\" or keeping it as \"Shaddai\" to maintain accuracy, which the student's response did not explicitly align with. Overall, while the student's answer was informative, it lacked a direct focus on ensuring the accurate representation of God's name in different languages."
