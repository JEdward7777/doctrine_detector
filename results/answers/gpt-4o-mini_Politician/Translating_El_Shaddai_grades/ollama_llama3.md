The phrase "El Shaddai," which is often understood to mean "God Almighty" or "the All-Sufficient One," is translated in various ways in different languages based on local Bible translations and cultural contexts. Here are some examples of how "El Shaddai" is rendered in different languages:

1. **Spanish**: "El Shaddai" is commonly retained in its original form, but it can also be translated as "Dios Todopoderoso."
2. **French**: Typically translated as "Dieu Tout-Puissant."
3. **German**: This phrase is usually rendered as "Gott der Allmächtige."
4. **Italian**: Often translated as "Dio Onnipotente."
5. **Portuguese**: It is generally translated as "Deus Todo-Poderoso."
6. **Chinese (Simplified)**: "全能的上帝" (Quánnéng de Shàngdì), which means "Almighty God."
7. **Russian**: Translated as "Всемогущий Бог" (Vsemogushchiy Bog), meaning "Almighty God."
8. **Arabic**: It can be rendered as "الله القدير" (Allah al-Qadīr), which translates to "The All-Powerful God."

These translations reflect not just linguistic differences but also local understandings of the divine attributes associated with God in diverse cultures. It is essential to approach these translations with sensitivity to local traditions and beliefs.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response provides some examples of how "El Shaddai" is translated in different languages, which addresses the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across cultures and languages. However, it does not engage deeply with the issue or provide much theological reflection on why these translations are significant.

In contrast to the provided answer, this response does not simply state that "El Shaddai" can be translated as 'God Almighty' or kept as 'Shaddai', but rather provides more nuanced examples of different translations. This suggests a higher level of engagement with the issue and a willingness to consider local understandings and traditions.

However, the response could be improved by providing more context and analysis on why these translations are significant and how they reflect God's character across cultures. Additionally, it would have been helpful to include some theological reflection on what this means for our understanding of God and his relationship with different cultures and languages.

Overall, while the response provides some useful information and examples, it could be more robust in its analysis and engagement with the concern.
