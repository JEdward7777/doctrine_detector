Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a good overview of how "El Shaddai" is translated into various languages, demonstrating an understanding of linguistic differences and cultural contexts. However, it does not address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages from a Christian worldview perspective. A stronger connection to the theological significance of God's name and the importance of maintaining its integrity and meaning would have enhanced the response.
