However, the response lacks a specific focus on the Christian understanding of fear in relation to God. It is important for a Christian worldview response to emphasize the biblical context of fear as both reverence for God's holiness and a healthy respect that leads to obedience. A stronger connection to Christian doctrinal teachings on fear would have enhanced the overall accuracy and depth of the response."
