  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of retaining \"Zion\" and \"Daughter\" in translations due to their rich figurative meanings, historical significance, and theological depth. The writer provides specific examples and explanations for each point, demonstrating a clear understanding of the cultural, spiritual, and literary contexts that underlie these terms.\n\nWhile the response is strong overall, it could be even more effective if it explicitly connected the importance of retaining these terms to the concern of ensuring adequate conveyance of the original text's spiritual and cultural significance. However, this connection is implied through the explanations provided, making the response a solid 85 out of 100."
