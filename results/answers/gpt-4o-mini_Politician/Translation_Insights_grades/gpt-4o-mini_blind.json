The emphasis on inclusivity and diverse beliefs, while important in a broader dialogue, should not compromise the foundational theological understanding of this concept within a Christian worldview. The translations provided do not fully capture the richness and depth of the biblical understanding that humans and Jesus are created uniquely in the image of God, sharing in His nature and reflecting His glory. More specificity and clarity rooted in biblical theology would greatly enhance the response."
