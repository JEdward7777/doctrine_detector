  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful and inclusive suggested translations for the phrase \"image of God\" when applied to humans and Jesus, highlighting the significance of each translation. However, the student's answer lacked specificity and direct connection to biblical teachings within a Christian worldview. The suggested translations did not directly align with the traditional Christian understanding of the concept. Incorporating more references to biblical passages and theological insights specific to Christianity would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
