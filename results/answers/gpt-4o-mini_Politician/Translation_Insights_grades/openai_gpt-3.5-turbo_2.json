However, from a Christian worldview, some of the suggested translations may be considered as veering towards a more secular or universalist perspective, rather than strictly reflecting the theological implications and significance of being created in the image of God. While the response is well-reasoned and respectful, it could be strengthened by incorporating more explicitly Christian interpretations that align closely with traditional theological understanding of this concept."
