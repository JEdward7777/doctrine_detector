The focus on inclusivity and general ethical principles overshadows the importance of understanding the specific theological implications of the concept of the \"image of God\" within Christianity. In a Christian-specific worldview, it is crucial to emphasize the unique relationship between humanity and God, as well as the divinity of Jesus Christ. Thus, the response could benefit from deeper theological reflection and alignment with Christian teachings."
