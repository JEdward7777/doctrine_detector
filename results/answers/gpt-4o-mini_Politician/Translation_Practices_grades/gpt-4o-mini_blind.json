  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a well-rounded explanation of why many Bible translations use \"LORD\" in place of \"Yahweh.\" The student effectively addresses the reverence for God's name, historical context, linguistic clarity, and translation philosophy. The only area that could be improved is expanding on the importance of recognizing the Jewish tradition of substituting the sacred name with \"Adonai,\" which directly impacts the usage of \"LORD\" in Christian translations. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological reasons behind the use of \"LORD\" in Bible translations."
