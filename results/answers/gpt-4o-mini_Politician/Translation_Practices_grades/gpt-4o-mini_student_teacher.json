  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-reasoned response that addressed various aspects such as reverence for God's name, historical context, linguistic clarity, and translation philosophy. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly connecting the reverence for God's name to the concern about clarity in the translation of sacred texts. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and provided a thoughtful explanation."
