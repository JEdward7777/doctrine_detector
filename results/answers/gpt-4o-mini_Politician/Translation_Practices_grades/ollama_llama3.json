  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides some good insights into why \"LORD\" might be used instead of \"Yahweh\", including historical tradition and reverence for God's name. However, it lacks specificity and detail, failing to fully address the concern about clarity in translation. Additionally, while the response mentions reverence, it does not delve deeply enough into this aspect, which is a crucial consideration when dealing with sacred texts.\n\nThe original answer provided only touches on the historical tradition of reverencing God's name, but fails to provide much depth or context. The response I graded provides more information and considers multiple factors that contribute to the use of \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\". While it could still be improved by providing even more clarity and detail, it is a better attempt at addressing the concern than the original answer."
