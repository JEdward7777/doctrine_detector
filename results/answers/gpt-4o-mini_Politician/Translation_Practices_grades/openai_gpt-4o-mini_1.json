It addresses the concern of clarity in translation of sacred texts by discussing the historical traditions and linguistic considerations that have influenced this choice. The response also emphasizes the importance of maintaining reverence for God's name, aligning well with a Christian worldview that values both clarity in scripture translation and respect for the sacred."
