I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of being zealous, particularly in a biblical context. The provided alternatives capture various nuances of the original meaning, including connotations of passion, commitment, and enthusiasm. The examples are specific, relevant, and respectful of the Christian faith. While the initial answer is not identical to the given alternative translations, it does show an attempt to understand the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith.

The main area for improvement is that the response could be more explicitly connected to the concern about understanding different translations aiding in grasping the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith. However, the provided examples and explanations do implicitly address this concern by showing how various translations can capture different shades of meaning related to commitment and dedication.

Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and provides relevant examples that are respectful of the Christian faith, making it a strong grade.
