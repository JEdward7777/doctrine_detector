  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of how the term \"Lord\" differs in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people. It appropriately highlights the divine connotations associated with God as \"Lord\" and the societal implications when referring to ordinary individuals. The answer could have been further strengthened by incorporating scriptural references or examples from Christian theology to support the distinctions made. Additionally, emphasizing the theological significance of God as the ultimate Lord could enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response. Overall, a solid explanation with room for deeper theological exploration."
