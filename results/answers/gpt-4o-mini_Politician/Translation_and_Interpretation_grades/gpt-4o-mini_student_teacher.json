  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good explanation of how the term \"Lord\" can differ in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people. They correctly highlight the sense of divinity and authority associated with the term when used for God. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms, specifically in how these linguistic choices impact one's understanding of scripture and the nature of God. Additionally, while the student mentions the different connotations of \"Lord\" when used for ordinary people, they could have been more explicit in connecting this to biblical interpretation. Overall, a solid response but could have been more focused on the concern provided."
