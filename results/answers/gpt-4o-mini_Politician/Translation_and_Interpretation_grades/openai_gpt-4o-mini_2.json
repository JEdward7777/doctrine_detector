However, it falls short of explicitly addressing the concern about the impact of translation and interpretation of biblical terms on the understanding of scripture and the nature of God from a Christian worldview perspective. More emphasis on the significance of accurately translating and interpreting biblical terms, especially in relation to understanding the nature of God, would have strengthened the response in light of the concern provided."
