They effectively address the importance of capturing the original intent while balancing cultural implications. However, the student could improve by providing more specific translations in line with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The emphasis on respectful dialogue and contextualization is commendable but could be strengthened by aligning more closely with the reference answer's direct translations."
