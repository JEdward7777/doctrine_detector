However, the translation provided by the teacher, \"Yes, I tell you sincerely\" or \"What I am telling you is true,\" should have been directly compared and contrasted with the student's translations to show the accuracy and faithfulness to the original meaning of Jesus' words. Further exploration and explanation of the significance and implications of these translations in biblical interpretation would have strengthened the response."
