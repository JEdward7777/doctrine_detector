  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the different translations of \"truly I tell you\" in various languages, which shows an understanding of the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. The example translations given are also helpful in conveying the sense of sincerity and certainty that Jesus intended.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly address the concern about understanding the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. While it provides some useful information, it could be more explicit in highlighting the significance of accurate translation and interpretation in understanding the Bible.\n\nThe student's answer, \"Yes, I tell you sincerely\" or \"What I am telling you is true,\" is also somewhat vague and does not fully capture the sense of urgency and emphasis that Jesus intended with his phrase. A more specific and detailed response would have been beneficial in addressing this concern.\n\nOverall, while the response has some good points, it could be improved by providing a clearer connection to the concern about accurate biblical translation and interpretation, as well as providing a more specific and detailed answer that fully captures the sense of Jesus' original phrase."
