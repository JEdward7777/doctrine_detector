  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful suggestions that respect the spiritual and communal aspects of the term 'church.' However, some of the proposed translations, such as 'Place of Worship' and 'House of Faith,' may not fully capture the inclusive nature of the church as the reference answer emphasizes. The student could have focused more on translations that specifically highlight the unity and inclusivity of believers as part of the church."
