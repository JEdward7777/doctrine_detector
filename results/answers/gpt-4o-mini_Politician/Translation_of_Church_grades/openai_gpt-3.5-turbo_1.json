The proposed translations emphasize both the communal and spiritual aspects of the church, ensuring that they refer to all believers. The use of terms like 'congregation', 'assembly', and 'gathering together' reflect the inclusive nature of the church as a community of believers from various backgrounds. The response demonstrates a deep consideration of the concern and offers translations that honor the diverse interpretations of the term 'church' within a Christian worldview."
