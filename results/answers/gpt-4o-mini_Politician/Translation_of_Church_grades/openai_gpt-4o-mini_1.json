The suggested translations reflect the concern for accurate representation of the church's inclusive nature by emphasizing communal aspects and ensuring it refers to all believers. The suggestions offered promote understanding and respect among various faith communities, which aligns well with a Christian specific worldview that values unity and inclusivity within the body of believers."
