The suggestions offered encompass a range of meanings and nuances, reflecting a deep understanding of the inclusive nature of the church. The response effectively addresses the concern by presenting translations that encompass all believers and not just specific groups. Great job in upholding the inclusive nature of the church in the translations provided."
