The considerations given for various language translations show respect for the cultural and religious significance of the term. The inclusion of consultation with religious leaders and the emphasis on cultural sensitivity are particularly commendable. The response could be further strengthened by incorporating scriptural references that emphasize the significance of the term 'Lord Yahweh' in Christian theology."
