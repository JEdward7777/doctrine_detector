  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response to the question, considering various languages and cultural sensitivities in translating the term 'Lord Yahweh.' They demonstrated an understanding of the importance of context, language nuances, and consultation with religious leaders. However, the student could improve their grade by directly addressing the concern of maintaining the accurate meaning of God's titles and presence in Scripture, as outlined in the reference answer from the teacher. Additionally, the student's proposed translations were more focused on linguistic variations rather than accurately conveying the theological significance of the term."
