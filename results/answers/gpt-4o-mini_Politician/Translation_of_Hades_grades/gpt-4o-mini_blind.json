  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a good overview of potential translations for the terms 'Hades' and 'Sheol' that respect their biblical meanings. The translations offered are generally accurate and respectful of the original meanings. However, the student could improve the response by delving deeper into the theological significance of these terms in the Christian worldview. Additionally, providing more specific biblical references or examples could enhance the response further. Overall, a solid effort with room for expansion and deeper theological reflection."
