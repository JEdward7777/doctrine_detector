  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical meanings of 'Hades' and 'Sheol'. They offered suitable translation options that align with the original references from a Christian worldview. The student's suggestions show sensitivity to maintaining the accuracy of biblical representation, contributing to greater understanding among believers. While their answer slightly elaborated more than necessary compared to the reference answer, it still effectively addresses the concern and offers meaningful insights."
