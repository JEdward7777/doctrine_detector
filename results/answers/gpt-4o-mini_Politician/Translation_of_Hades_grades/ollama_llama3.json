  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical context and linguistic roots of \"Sheol\" and \"Hades\". The various translation options provided are accurate and respectful of the original meanings, showing an awareness of the theological implications. The suggestion to provide context for diverse audiences is also a thoughtful consideration.\n\nThe only area where this response falls short is in directly addressing the concern about ensuring accurate biblical representation. While the provided translations are indeed accurate, the response could be strengthened by explicitly stating that accuracy is a key consideration when discussing these terms.\n\nOverall, I would say that this response is well-researched and informative, but could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern about accuracy in biblical representation."
