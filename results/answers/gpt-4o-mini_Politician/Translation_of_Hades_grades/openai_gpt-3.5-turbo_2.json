  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of translation options for the terms 'Sheol' and 'Hades' within biblical contexts, demonstrating sensitivity to linguistic roots and theological implications. It offers multiple reliable translation options that respect the original meanings while addressing the concern of accurate biblical representation for understanding among believers. One suggestion for improvement could be to include more direct references to biblical passages or theological frameworks that inform the translations provided, further strengthening the Christian worldview perspective."
