  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and respectful list of translations for the term \"Holy One\" in different languages, showing sensitivity to cultural and religious nuances. However, to improve the grade, the student could have included a brief explanation of the theological significance of the term \"Holy One\" in Christianity, emphasizing its connection to the nature of God as holy and set apart. Such an addition would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response."
