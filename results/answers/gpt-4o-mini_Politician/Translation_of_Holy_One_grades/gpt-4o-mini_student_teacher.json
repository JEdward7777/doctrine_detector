  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of respectful translations in different languages for the term \"Holy One,\" showing sensitivity to cultural and religious nuances. However, the student could have improved the answer by incorporating the theological implications more explicitly, aligning with the concern of maintaining accurate representation of the term in translations. Focusing on retaining the meaning of holiness and the divine connotations, as specified in the reference answer, would have strengthened the theological aspect of the translations provided."
