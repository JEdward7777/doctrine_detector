Comment: The student provided a good list of translations for the term "predestined" in various languages, showing effort in researching different linguistic nuances. However, they could have tied these translations back to the specific biblical context of predestination and provided more direct translations aligned with the reference answer. More emphasis on connecting these translations to biblical meanings would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
