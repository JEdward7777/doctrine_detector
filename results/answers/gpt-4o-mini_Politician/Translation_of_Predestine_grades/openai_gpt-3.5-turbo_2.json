However, while the translations capture the general idea of predestination, the root biblical concept of God's sovereign choice and foreknowledge may not be fully conveyed in all languages. It would have been beneficial to include a brief explanation or clarification on the biblical understanding of predestination to ensure a more accurate understanding in translation."
