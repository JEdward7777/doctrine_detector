  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach to translating the term 'Rabbi' while also considering the concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The considerations listed demonstrate a thoughtful and respectful attitude towards the title's significance and ensure that the translation maintains reverence towards Jesus' role as a teacher. The response could further enhance its Christian-specific worldview by explicitly connecting the importance of theological accuracy in representing Jesus as more than just a schoolteacher in the translation process. Overall, a well-thought-out and respectful response."
