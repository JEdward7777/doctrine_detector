  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-thought-out approach to translating the term 'Rabbi' while respecting the significance of the title and cultural contexts. The focus on accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith is addressed indirectly through the consideration of honoring the title's significance and not implying that Jesus was merely a schoolteacher. This response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the importance of maintaining respect for religious figures and their roles."
