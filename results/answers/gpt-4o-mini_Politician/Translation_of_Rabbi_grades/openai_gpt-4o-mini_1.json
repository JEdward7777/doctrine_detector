The focus on cultural context, respectful titles, and religious nuances demonstrates a sensitivity to the significance of the term. However, it could be strengthened by explicitly emphasizing the unique role of Jesus as the ultimate teacher and spiritual leader within Christianity, and how translations should reflect this pivotal aspect of His identity."
