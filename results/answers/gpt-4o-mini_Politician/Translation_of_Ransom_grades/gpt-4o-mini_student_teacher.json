  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a good range of translations for the term \"ransom\" in various languages, which aligns with the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. The translations given accurately convey the idea of a sum of money or payment demanded for the release of a person or property. The clarity and effort put into providing multiple translations deserve recognition. However, to achieve a higher grade, the student could have further expanded on the nuances of the term \"ransom\" in theological contexts, as outlined in the reference answer from the teacher. This additional depth would have enhanced the theological understanding of the term beyond its basic definition."
