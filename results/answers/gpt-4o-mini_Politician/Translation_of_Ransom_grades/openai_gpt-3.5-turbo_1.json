  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts by providing translations of the term \"ransom\" in various languages. The translations chosen align well with the Christian concept of ransom, emphasizing the idea of a payment made to secure freedom. The response could have further elaborated on how the theological significance of ransom is maintained in these translations, but overall, it demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the concern at hand."
