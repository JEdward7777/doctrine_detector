The emphasis on capturing the essence of the term and maintaining clarity is commendable. However, the response could have further linked the importance of accurate translation to the Christian faith, highlighting the significance of understanding ransom in the context of Christ's redemptive work. Such additional theological reflection would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
