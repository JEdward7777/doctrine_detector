## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for "Your Majesty" in various languages, which shows effort and research. However, the concern specified the importance of accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings. The reference answer emphasizes using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' which may align more closely with biblical principles of humility and respect for authority. Therefore, while the student's answer is informative, it lacks a direct connection to biblical teachings regarding titles and honorifics, resulting in a lower grade.
