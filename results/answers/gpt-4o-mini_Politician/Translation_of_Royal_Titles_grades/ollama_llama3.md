The phrase "Your Majesty" is a term of respect used to address royalty, particularly kings and queens. Here are some appropriate translations in various languages:

1. **Spanish**: "Su Majestad"
2. **French**: "Votre Majesté"
3. **German**: "Ihre Majestät"
4. **Italian**: "Vostra Maestà"
5. **Portuguese**: "Sua Majestade"
6. **Russian**: "Ваше Величество" (Vashe Velichestvo)
7. **Chinese (Mandarin)**: "陛下" (Bìxià)
8. **Japanese**: "陛下" (Heika)
9. **Arabic**: "جلالتك" (Jalalatek)
10. **Korean**: "전하" (Jeonha)

Using local expressions demonstrates respect for cultural nuances and traditions, which is essential in diplomatic and formal interactions. Each term carries its own connotations and historical significance, reflecting the unique cultural practices of addressing royalty in different societies.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the original response does provide some translations for "Your Majesty", it falls short in terms of accuracy and respectfulness, particularly when considering biblical teachings. The response suggests that "Your Majesty" can be translated as other titles, such as "your Highness," or "your Excellency", which may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, the response does not take into account the cultural significance and historical context of each term.

In contrast, the provided response provides a more comprehensive list of translations for "Your Majesty", including terms used in different languages and cultures. This shows an appreciation for the nuances of addressing royalty in various societies, which is essential in diplomatic and formal interactions, as stated in the original response.

However, I would deduct points because the response does not explicitly consider biblical teachings or demonstrate a clear understanding of their relevance to translation.
