  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: While the response provides a detailed list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages and emphasizes the importance of cultural respect, it falls short in addressing the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings. A Christian worldview would require considering biblical teachings on titles and authority, which may not align perfectly with cultural practices related to royalty. Additional commentary on how biblical principles should guide translations of royal titles would have strengthened the response."
