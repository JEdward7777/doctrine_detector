However, it lacks a Christian specific perspective on the term, which is crucial when considering a recommended translation. It would have been beneficial to emphasize the Christian understanding of saints as believers who are set apart and sanctified by God, and to suggest translations that reflect this theological significance. Additionally, the response should have highlighted the biblical basis for the concept of saints and the importance of accuracy in translation for preserving doctrinal integrity."
