  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the importance of considering different cultural connotations and being mindful of inclusive language, which aligns with the concern about using language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The suggestion to use terms like \"exemplary individuals\" or \"venerated figures\" is also a good attempt at finding a more general term.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about avoiding specific Christian groups and instead suggests alternative translations that still may be specific to Christianity (\"holy ones,\" \"holy people,\" or \"holy believers in Jesus\"). While these terms are indeed inclusive of Christians from different denominations, they do not entirely avoid referring to specific Christian groups.\n\nOverall, while the response shows an effort to be mindful of inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, it could benefit from further exploration of more general and secular terms that would be widely accepted by people of various faiths or no faith."
