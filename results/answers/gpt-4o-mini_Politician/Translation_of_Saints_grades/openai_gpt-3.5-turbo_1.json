The suggestions of 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus' are respectful and encompassing of all believers in Jesus without singling out specific Christian groups. The response could have further emphasized the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and practices, but overall it aligns well with the given concern."
