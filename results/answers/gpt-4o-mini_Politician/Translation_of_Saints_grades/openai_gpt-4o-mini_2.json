  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provided a good range of alternative translations for \"saints\" that maintain a Christian perspective while also being inclusive. However, it could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern raised and explicitly ensuring that the translations do not refer to specific Christian groups. Overall, the response demonstrated a solid understanding of the Christian worldview in translation considerations."
