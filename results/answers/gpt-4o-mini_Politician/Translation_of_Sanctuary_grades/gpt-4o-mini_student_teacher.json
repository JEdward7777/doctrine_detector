The response covers various considerations related to cultural sensitivity, legal implications, and inclusivity, which are important but may not directly address the concern of preserving the Biblical definition of \"sanctuary.\" Encouraging the student to strengthen their response by incorporating more emphasis on ensuring the translation accurately reflects the original sacred and holy connotations of the term would lead to a more comprehensive answer aligned with a Christian worldview."
