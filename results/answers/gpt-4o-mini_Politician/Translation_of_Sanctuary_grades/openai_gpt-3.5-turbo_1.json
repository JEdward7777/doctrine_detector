  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides thorough and thoughtful considerations for translating the term \"sanctuary\" in modern texts while maintaining its original Biblical definition as a holy and sacred place. The response recognizes the importance of preserving the original meaning of Biblical terms and offers practical advice for ensuring accurate translations across cultural contexts. The only minor improvement could be explicitly emphasizing the significance of preserving the sanctity and holiness associated with the Biblical term \"sanctuary\" throughout the translation process. Overall, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the concern and provides a comprehensive approach to addressing it."
