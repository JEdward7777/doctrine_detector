  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response does a thorough job of addressing the concern of maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms, specifically focusing on the term \"sanctuary.\" The student provides excellent considerations for translating the term with cultural sensitivity, legal accuracy, inclusivity, and respect for diverse audiences. The response acknowledges the Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place, aligning with the concern of preserving the original meaning. The only point that could be improved is a stronger emphasis on the Biblical context of the term throughout the response. Overall, a well-constructed and thoughtful analysis with a solid Christian worldview perspective."
