  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating the term 'Savior' as 'the One who saves' or 'who rescues from enemies' on our understanding of God's role in the lives of believers. The student effectively highlights the personal, relational, and communal aspects of God's saving work and encourages engagement with faith and social justice issues. To enhance the grade, the student could have included more direct references to scriptural examples or theological concepts related to God as Savior."
