  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student offers a thoughtful reflection on the implications of translating 'Savior' as 'the One who saves' or 'who rescues from enemies,' drawing out personal, communal, and salvific dimensions. However, the response could be improved by focusing more directly on how these translations shape theological understanding and faith practices, as outlined in the concern. Additionally, while the student's answer is insightful, it does not directly align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, missing some key theological nuances."
