Comment: While the student attempts to provide a contemporary translation of the phrase "house of Yahweh," the answer lacks doctrinal correctness. In a Christian worldview, the "house of Yahweh" specifically refers to the temple or dwelling place of God as understood in the Old Testament. The suggested translations stray too far from this foundational meaning and could potentially dilute the significance and uniqueness of the term. A more doctrinally correct translation reflecting the sacredness and direct link to God's presence would have been more appropriate.
