The alternatives presented are generally respectful of the original meaning and maintain a level of sensitivity. However, the response could have been improved by incorporating more explicitly Christian or scriptural language in the alternative translations to enhance doctrinal correctness within a Christian worldview. Additionally, emphasizing the significance of names in biblical contexts or citing specific biblical examples where naming plays a crucial role would have further strengthened the response."
