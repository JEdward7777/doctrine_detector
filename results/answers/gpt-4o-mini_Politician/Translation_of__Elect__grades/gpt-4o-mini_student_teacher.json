  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-developed response that addresses the evolution of the term \"elect\" in older and modern English Bible versions, discussing the nuances in translation and their impact on understanding Scripture. The student effectively touches on historical and contemporary implications of translation choices, and their influence on theological concepts and inclusivity. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and directly connected to the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God. A more focused and structured approach would have improved the alignment with the specific Christian worldview concern provided."
