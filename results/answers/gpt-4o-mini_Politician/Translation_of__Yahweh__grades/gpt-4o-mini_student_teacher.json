  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the reasons for churches preferring \"LORD\" over \"Yahweh\" in translations, encompassing aspects such as tradition, historical practices, clarity, understanding, and inclusivity. The response effectively addresses the concern raised about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices. However, the student could have further emphasized the significance of maintaining traditional translation practices to respect the original Hebrew text. Overall, a well-supported answer with room for slight improvement."
