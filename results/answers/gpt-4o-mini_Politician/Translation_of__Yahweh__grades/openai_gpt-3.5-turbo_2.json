However, it doesn't directly address the concern raised about the importance of using the original names of God versus cultural practices. While it touches on the importance of cultural and theological sensitivities, it could have delved deeper into the scriptural significance of using God's original name and how it relates to honoring God's sovereignty and uniqueness."
