  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translation suggestions for the term 'beloved' in various languages, maintaining the sentiment of love and affection. However, the reference answer from the teacher focused more on straightforward translations that directly convey the concept of being loved. The student's answer, while informative and culturally sensitive, could have included more direct and simple translations like 'loved' and 'loved one' to better align with accurate interpretation of biblical texts within a Christian worldview."
