The response could have provided more specific examples of actions that constitute worship of false gods, such as idolatry or practicing occult rituals, to further clarify the concept for Christians. Additionally, connecting the concept of worship directly to the Christian faith and teachings would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
