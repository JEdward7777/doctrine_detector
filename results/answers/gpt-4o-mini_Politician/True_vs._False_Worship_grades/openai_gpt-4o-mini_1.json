It effectively contrasts this with worshiping false gods, as evidenced by the examples of the Canaanites and Israelites in scripture. The concern about the importance of understanding true worship for Christians is addressed well. The only room for improvement could be further elaborating on how worshiping false gods can lead believers astray and the consequences of not directing honor and service solely to God."
