  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a general overview of criteria to consider when discerning between a true prophet and a false prophet. However, from a Christian worldview, there are some significant doctrinal omissions that impact the accuracy of the answer. The student has failed to emphasize crucial points such as the alignment of prophetic messages with the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Bible, the importance of testing prophecies against Scripture (Deuteronomy 18:21-22), and the recognition of false prophets through their denial of Jesus as the Son of God (1 John 4:1-3). Additionally, the response lacks a strong emphasis on the power of prayer and seeking discernment from the Holy Spirit when evaluating prophetic messages. These doctrinal weaknesses lower the overall grade of the answer."
