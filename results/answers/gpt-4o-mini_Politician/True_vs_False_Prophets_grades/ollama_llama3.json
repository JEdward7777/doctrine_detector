  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a thoughtful and comprehensive framework for distinguishing between true prophets and false ones, highlighting various criteria such as alignment with teachings, character and integrity, fulfillment of prophecies, impact on the community, discernment through community, compassion and empathy, and personal reflection. These points are well-supported by biblical principles and demonstrate a deep understanding of the complexities involved in discerning prophetic voices.\n\nThe response also acknowledges the importance of approaching this topic with sensitivity and an understanding of diverse perspectives, which shows a commitment to fostering open and respectful discussions about spirituality and faith.\n\nWhile the response does not directly mention God's Word or the nature of teachings, it does touch on the idea that true prophets' messages should align with established sacred texts or teachings. Additionally, the emphasis on compassion, love, and empathy as indicators of genuine inspiration is consistent with biblical teachings.\n\nThe only areas for improvement would be to provide more explicit connections to biblical principles and to explore potential limitations or challenges in applying these criteria in practical situations. Nonetheless, this response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced approach to discerning true prophetic voices from those that mislead or misrepresent God's messages, earning it a high grade of 85."
