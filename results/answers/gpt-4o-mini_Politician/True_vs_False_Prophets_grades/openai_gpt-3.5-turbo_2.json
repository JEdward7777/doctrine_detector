The criteria mentioned in the response are solid and aligned with a Christian worldview, focusing on scripture, ethical conduct, and the spiritual impact on the community. However, there could have been a clearer emphasis on the importance of discerning through the lens of biblical truth and the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding discernment."
