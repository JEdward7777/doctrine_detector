The concern is directly addressed by discussing specific criteria for evaluating prophetic voices. The inclusion of factors such as personal reflection, community discernment, and compassion aligns well with a Christian worldview emphasizing discernment of spirits and the fruits of the Spirit. The response could be enhanced by explicitly referencing the need for prayer and reliance on the Holy Spirit in discerning true prophetic voices."
