  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response that aligns with Christian principles in evaluating true and false prophets, emphasizing alignment with God's Word, teachings, and fruits of ministry. The criteria provided in the student's response are in line with Christian beliefs and offer a solid framework for discerning true prophetic voices. The response also encourages community engagement, personal reflection, and compassion, all of which are valued in the Christian worldview. The student could strengthen the response by explicitly referencing the importance of prayer and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit in discerning true prophets, as these aspects are essential in a Christian context."
