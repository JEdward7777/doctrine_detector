  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful answer that aligns well with Biblical principles on trustworthiness. They have effectively outlined key ways individuals can demonstrate trustworthiness in their actions according to Biblical teachings. The examples and verses they have provided are relevant and demonstrate a good understanding of the topic. However, the answer could be strengthened by directly addressing the concern of encouraging followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability. The student's response primarily focuses on individual actions rather than on how one can influence and encourage others to also embody trustworthiness."
