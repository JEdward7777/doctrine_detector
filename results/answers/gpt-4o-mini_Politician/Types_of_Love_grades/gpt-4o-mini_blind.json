  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the different forms of love as understood in a biblical context, particularly through the lenses of agape, philia, and eros. The explanation of each type of love is clear and well-supported by relevant biblical references. The student effectively connects these forms of love to the broader biblical definition of love as emphasized in the teachings of Jesus. One suggestion for improvement would be to include more explicit references to specific biblical passages related to philia and eros love to strengthen the argument. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
