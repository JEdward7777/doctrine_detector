  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation on the different forms of love in alignment with a biblical worldview, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern raised. The student could strengthen their response by explicitly tying each form of love to the principles of God's love as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of aligning brotherly and romantic love with the overarching theme of God's love throughout the Bible would enhance the coherence and depth of the answer.\n\nOverall, the student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and effectively incorporates biblical examples to support their points."
