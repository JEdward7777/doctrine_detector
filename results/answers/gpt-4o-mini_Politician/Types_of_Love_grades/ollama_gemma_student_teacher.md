## [Answer](../Types_of_Love.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The biblical definition of love is multifaceted and encompasses a variety of forms, each with its own significance and context. In the Bible, love is often described through the Greek terms "agape," "philia," and "eros," among others, each representing different aspects of love.

1. **Agape Love**: This is often understood as unconditional love, the highest form of love that is selfless and sacrificial. It is exemplified in passages like John 3:16, where God's love for humanity is conveyed through the act of giving. This form of love can be seen as encompassing all types of love, including brotherly and romantic love when expressed in a selfless manner.

2. **Philia Love**: This is often referred to as brotherly love, which embodies friendship, loyalty, and affection between individuals. In the Bible, this type of love is highlighted in passages such as Proverbs 17:17, which states that "A friend loves at all times," illustrating the deep bond and commitment found in friendships and familial relationships.

3. **Eros Love**: This represents romantic love, typically characterized by passion and desire. While the term "eros" is not explicitly used in many biblical texts, the concept is inherent in the relationship dynamics described in books like Song of Solomon. This type of love is celebrated as a vital part of human relationships when grounded in respect and commitment.

Each form of love can align with the biblical definition when it emphasizes virtues such as kindness, patience, and respect for others. The teachings of Jesus, particularly in the New Testament, encourage believers to love one another as foundational to their faith, encompassing all expressions of love in both platonic and romantic contexts.

In summary, different forms of love contribute to a richer understanding of the biblical definition, demonstrating that love is not monolithic, but rather a diverse and essential aspect of the human experience. Respecting and valuing each type of love allows for a holistic interpretation that honors the depth and complexity of relationships.
