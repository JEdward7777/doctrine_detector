  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of the spiritual significance of adoption in the Christian faith, going beyond the simple definition provided as the correct answer. The writer effectively explores the implications of being adopted as a child of God, highlighting themes such as unconditional love, new identity, access and relationship with God, and inclusivity.\n\nThe response also successfully connects these aspects to the broader context of Christian theology and practice, emphasizing the transformative power of adoption and its relevance to everyday life. The writer's use of biblical references (Ephesians 1:5) is also appreciated, as it grounds their understanding in Scripture.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected these themes to the concept of co-heirs with Christ mentioned in the correct answer. Nevertheless, the overall quality and depth of the response earn an score of 85."
