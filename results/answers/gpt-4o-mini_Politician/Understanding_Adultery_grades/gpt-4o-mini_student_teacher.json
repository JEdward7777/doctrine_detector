  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer regarding the consequences of committing adultery as addressed in the Bible. They referenced relevant Old and New Testament passages and highlighted the moral implications of adultery. However, the student could have strengthened their response by directly linking the consequences of adultery to its impact on marriage and spirituality as requested in the concern."
