## [Answer](../Understanding_Adultery.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Bible addresses adultery in several passages, highlighting its moral implications and consequences. In the Old Testament, the commandment "You shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:14) asserts the seriousness of this act. In the book of Leviticus, the consequences for adultery can be severe, including capital punishment, reflecting the cultural and legal norms of that time (Leviticus 20:10).

In the New Testament, Jesus speaks to the issue of adultery, emphasizing not just the physical act but also the intent behind it (Matthew 5:27-28). He conveys a message of compassion and forgiveness, particularly seen in the story of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-11), where he encourages those without sin to cast the first stone and ultimately tells her to "go and sin no more."

Overall, the Bible presents adultery as a serious moral transgression that can harm relationships and families, but also emphasizes the potential for forgiveness and redemption. Each individual's interpretation may vary, and discussions around these topics can be sensitive and nuanced, reflecting broader moral and ethical considerations.
