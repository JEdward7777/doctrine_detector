They provide relevant textual references and explanations from both the Old and New Testaments. The inclusion of insights about forgiveness and redemption adds nuance to their analysis. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern about the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality. While the text mentions the harm caused to relationships and families, it doesn't elaborate on the spiritual consequences of adultery as explicitly as the reference answer."
