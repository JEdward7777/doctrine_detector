However, from a Christian perspective, it would be important to emphasize that saying "amen" is not just about expressing support for the sentiments in the prayer but also about acknowledging God's authority and sovereignty. Additionally, the answer could have mentioned that the use of "amen" is rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ and the early Christian Church. There is room for further elaboration and depth to align the response more closely with Christian theology.
