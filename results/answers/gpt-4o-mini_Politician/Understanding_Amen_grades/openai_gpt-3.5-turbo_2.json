It acknowledges the significance of \"amen\" in expressing agreement with the prayer, which aligns well with Christian practice where prayer is a fundamental way of communicating with God. However, the response could have strengthened its relevance to Christian practice by explicitly mentioning the role of \"amen\" in signaling submission to God's will and the acknowledgement of His sovereignty in answering prayers."
