  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response accurately explains the meaning of \"amen\" as expressing agreement with or a desire for the fulfillment of a prayer. However, it lacks specific reference to the Christian perspective on prayer and its significance within Christian practice. To improve the grade, the response could have included how \"amen\" is frequently used in Christian prayer as a way of surrendering to God's will and affirming faith in His promises."
