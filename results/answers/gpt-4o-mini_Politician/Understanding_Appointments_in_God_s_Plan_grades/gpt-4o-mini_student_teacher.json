  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, including references to relevant scripture and discussions on theological interpretations. The student demonstrates an understanding of the significance of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation. However, the student's answer could be improved by aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer, which succinctly captures the essence of being appointed to eternal life as reflecting God's sovereign will and grace."
