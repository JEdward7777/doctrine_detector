It also correctly situates this concept within discussions of predestination and divine grace. The inclusion of scriptural support from Acts 13:48 is helpful in illustrating this idea.\n\nWhile the response does not fully engage with the concern about diverse interpretations and beliefs within Christianity, it does acknowledge the importance of respecting different perspectives held by individuals and denominations. To achieve a higher grade, the response could provide more detail on how different Christian traditions approach this concept or offer additional biblical examples to further illustrate the idea.\n\nOverall, the response provides a strong foundation for understanding the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" and demonstrates a good grasp of the theological issues surrounding divine selection and grace."
