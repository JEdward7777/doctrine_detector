  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" within a Christian context, aligning well with the given answer and concern. It effectively discusses the theological implications, biblical references, varying interpretations within Christianity, and the importance of respectful engagement with diverse perspectives. The only slight improvement could be to further emphasize the role of individual faith and response to God's grace in conjunction with His sovereign will."
