Believing in something typically refers to having faith or confidence in an idea, concept, value, or principle. For example, one might believe in democracy, equality, or sustainability. This belief often encompasses a sense of conviction about the importance or validity of these ideas.

On the other hand, believing someone refers to the trust or confidence placed in an individual, particularly regarding their honesty, integrity, or capability. For instance, you might believe someone when they share a personal experience or when they make a promise. This belief often hinges on the relationship and history you have with that person.

In summary, believing in something relates to abstract concepts or ideologies, while believing someone pertains to personal trust and credibility.
