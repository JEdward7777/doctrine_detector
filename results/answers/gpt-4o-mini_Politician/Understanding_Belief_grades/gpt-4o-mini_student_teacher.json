  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. The student correctly distinguished between believing in something and believing someone, highlighting the differences in abstract concepts versus personal trust and credibility. However, the student's response did not directly address the Christian-specific worldview or the nuances of faith in relation to trust in God and others, missing the opportunity to incorporate the aspect of faith in their explanation. To improve their answer, the student could have integrated biblical examples of faith in God and trust in Jesus as the ultimate example of belief in someone."
