However, the response could have delved deeper into the distinct nature of faith in relation to trusting in God versus trusting in others, emphasizing the ultimate importance of faith in God as the foundation for all other relationships. Incorporating more explicitly Christian perspectives or Scripture references would have strengthened the response further."
