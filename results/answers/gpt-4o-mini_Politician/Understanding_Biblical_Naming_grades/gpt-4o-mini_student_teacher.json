  "grade": 55.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 55.\n\nThe student provides a detailed explanation of the significance of biblical names and effectively connects the naming of John to the character's identity and purpose in the biblical narrative. However, they overly complicate the interpretation by delving deeply into theological themes and specific biblical references without directly answering the question. The reference answer was much more concise and directly addressed the question at hand. The student's answer could be improved by focusing more on directly addressing the question in a clear and concise manner."
