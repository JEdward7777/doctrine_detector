The references to Leviticus 24:15-16 and Matthew 12:31-32 effectively highlighted the seriousness of blasphemy. Additionally, citing James 4:11-12 and Ephesians 4:29 to emphasize the importance of respectful speech towards others was a good application of relevant passages. However, a stronger connection could have been made between blasphemy against God and the impact on relationships with others, as both stem from a lack of reverence and love. Drawing out this correlation would have enhanced the response further."
