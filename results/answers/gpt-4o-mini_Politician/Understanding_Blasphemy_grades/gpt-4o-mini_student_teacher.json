  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-structured answer that addresses the biblical implications of speaking against God or others. They appropriately reference relevant biblical passages and emphasize the importance of respectful speech. However, there is room for improvement in connecting the definition of blasphemy more directly to disrespectful speech and behavior, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. Enhancing this connection would strengthen the alignment with the Christian worldview concern provided."
