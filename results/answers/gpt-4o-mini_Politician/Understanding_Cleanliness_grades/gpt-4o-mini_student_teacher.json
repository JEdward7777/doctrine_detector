  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the Biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean' in relation to moral purity, drawing connections between the cultural, historical, and religious context. The response effectively explores how these concepts are reflected in ethical standards and the need for grace and redemption. However, the student could strengthen their response by emphasizing more on the symbolic nature of cleanliness in a spiritual context and relating it directly to moral purity. Additionally, tying in more explicitly with the teacher's reference answer would have further enhanced the response."
