It effectively connects the symbolism of cleanliness to the broader theme of spiritual purification and aligns well with the concern regarding the guidance it offers to believers in their personal and communal lives. The inclusion of relevant examples and the emphasis on the ongoing journey of moral purity demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
