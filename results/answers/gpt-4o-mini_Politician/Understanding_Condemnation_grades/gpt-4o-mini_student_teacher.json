  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful analysis of the nature of condemnation as referenced in 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16, effectively highlighting the themes of internal struggle, God's grace transcending human emotions, and the contrast between condemnation and justification through Christ. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by explicitly stating the central Christian teaching that through Christ, believers are freed from condemnation."
