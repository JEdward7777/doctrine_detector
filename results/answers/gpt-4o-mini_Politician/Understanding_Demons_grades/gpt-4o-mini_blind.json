  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and insightful explanation of the term \"unclean spirit\" in relation to demons as described in Christian teachings. They have accurately captured the concept of moral impurity and spiritual defilement associated with unclean spirits and their disruptive nature. The response appropriately connects biblical references and the deeper significance of unclean spirits in influencing behavior and spiritual well-being. However, the grade is slightly lowered due to the lack of emphasis on the authority of Jesus over unclean spirits in Christian teachings and the need for deliverance through faith in Him. This aspect could enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
