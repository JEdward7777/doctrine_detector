  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a thorough explanation of the term \"unclean spirit\" in Christian teachings, their answer is lacking in clarity and specificity compared to the reference answer. The student's response veers into metaphorical and abstract interpretations, straying somewhat from the direct association with demons as described in Christian teachings. However, they do touch on key aspects such as moral impurity and disruptive nature of demons. \n\nOverall, the student shows a good understanding of the topic but could improve by specifically linking the term \"unclean spirit\" to demons that oppose God's will as in the reference answer."
