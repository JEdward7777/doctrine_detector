  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful explanation of the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. They effectively highlight the differences in motivations, perspectives, and outcomes between the two forms of judgment, drawing on relevant biblical references. However, in order to improve their grade, the student could have emphasized more explicitly the foundation of God's judgment in His perfect righteousness and justice, as well as the aspect of repentance in response to His judgment. This additional focus would have strengthened the alignment with the Christian worldview."
