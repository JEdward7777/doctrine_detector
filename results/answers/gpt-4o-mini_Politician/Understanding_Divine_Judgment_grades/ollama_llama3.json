  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of highlighting the distinction between God's perfect judgment and human judgment, acknowledging that God's judgment is characterized by love, mercy, and wisdom, while human judgment can be flawed and biased. The examples from Scripture (1 Samuel 16:7 and Matthew 7:1-2) are also well-chosen and effectively illustrate this point.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger in its connection to the concern of understanding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. While it does make a clear distinction between the two, it could benefit from more explicit language or examples that highlight the implications of this distinction for how we approach others or evaluate their actions.\n\nOverall, I would give this response an A- grade. With some further development to explicitly address the concern, it could easily earn an A+."
