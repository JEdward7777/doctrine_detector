## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The Bible speaks extensively about God’s judgment, portraying it as just, righteous, and ultimately rooted in love and mercy. God's judgment is often described as all-knowing, as He sees beyond outward appearances and understands the true intentions of the heart. For example, 1 Samuel 16:7 reminds us that while humans look at the exterior, God looks at the heart.

In contrast, human judgment can often be flawed, influenced by bias, limited information, and personal experiences. Individuals may make assumptions based on superficial traits or circumstances, leading to unfair or unjust conclusions. As Matthew 7:1-2 cautions, we are reminded to be careful not to judge others hastily, as the measure we use may be applied to us in return.

Overall, while God’s judgment is characterized by perfect wisdom and grace, guiding individuals toward reconciliation and growth, human judgment can be limited and may unintentionally foster division or misunderstanding. This distinction encourages us to approach others with compassion and humility, recognizing that everyone is on their own unique journey.
