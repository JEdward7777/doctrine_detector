  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student gives a thorough and thoughtful explanation of the term \"divine nature,\" encompassing various attributes attributed to God in different contexts. The response also highlights the importance of understanding divine nature in shaping believers' relationships with God and guiding ethical principles. However, there is slightly too much emphasis on the differences in interpretations across cultures and religions, which dilutes the focus on the essential characteristics of God's divine nature."
