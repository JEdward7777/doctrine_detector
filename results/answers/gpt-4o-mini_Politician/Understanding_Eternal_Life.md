The Bible presents several teachings regarding inheriting eternal life, with various passages emphasizing faith, obedience, and the nature of God's kingdom. 

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: One of the central messages of the New Testament is that faith in Jesus is essential for eternal life. For example, John 3:16 states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

2. **Obedience to God's Commands**: In Mark 10:17-21, a rich young ruler asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus mentions keeping the commandments, highlighting the importance of living a life aligned with God's moral teachings.

3. **The Role of Grace**: Many passages, particularly in the letters of Paul, emphasize that eternal life is a gift from God, accessible through grace. Ephesians 2:8-9 states, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."

4. **Living a Righteous Life**: In Matthew 25:31-46, the parable of the sheep and the goats illustrates that caring for those in need and living righteously are critical aspects of inheriting the kingdom of God.

5. **The Resurrection and New Life**: In eternal life, the Bible points to a future resurrection and the promise of new creation, as seen in Revelation 21:1-4, where God creates a new heaven and earth, and where there will be no more suffering or death.

In summary, the biblical teachings on inheriting eternal life revolve around faith in Jesus, obedience to God's commandments, the importance of grace, righteousness, and the hope of resurrection and renewal. These themes encourage believers to live lives that reflect their faith and values.
