  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of various biblical teachings regarding inheriting eternal life, there was a lack of emphasis on the direct correlation between obeying God's laws and having faith in Him as the key elements for attaining eternal life, which was the specific focus provided in the reference answer. The student's response covered additional important aspects like grace, righteousness, and the promise of resurrection, but the core emphasis on obeying God's laws and having faith could have been more pronounced to align closely with the specified concern."
