  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the distinctions between 'evil' and 'wickedness' in terms of moral character and behavior according to the Bible. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the nuances between the two concepts and references relevant biblical passages to support their points. The writing is clear and cohesive. However, the response could be enhanced by providing more direct connections to core Christian doctrines or theological principles that underpin the concepts of 'evil' and 'wickedness' in a Christian worldview."
