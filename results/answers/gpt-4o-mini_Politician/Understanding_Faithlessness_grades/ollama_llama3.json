  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge that the term \"faithless\" can have negative connotations, especially in a religious context, which partially addresses the concern to help individuals recognize the significance of faith in moral conduct. However, it falls short in providing a more nuanced understanding of what faith means and how it relates to morality.\n\nThe given answer is also problematic as it simplistically equates lack of belief with immoral actions, which oversimplifies the complex relationship between faith and morality. A more thoughtful discussion would recognize that faith can be a motivating factor for good or evil, depending on one's beliefs and values.\n\nTo improve, I would suggest providing more depth and context to understanding what faith means in moral conduct, and how it can influence an individual's actions."
