  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the historical and cultural context affecting Israelite-Gentile relationships in the early church. They effectively highlight the shift in perceptions and the challenges faced in unity within the church. The response could have been improved by directly addressing the issue of traditional Jewish views of Gentiles as outlined in the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student provides a well-structured and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
