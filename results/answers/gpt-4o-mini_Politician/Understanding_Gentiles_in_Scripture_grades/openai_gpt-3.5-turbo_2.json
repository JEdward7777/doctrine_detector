It effectively acknowledges the traditional views of Gentiles as outsiders and how these perceptions evolved within the early church. The emphasis on inclusivity and unity through faith in Christ aligns with Christian principles. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the role of God's plan and sovereignty in bringing Jew and Gentile together, as seen throughout Scripture, to fully reflect a Christian-specific worldview."
