  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful and insightful answer that aligns well with the Christian perspective on God's personal relationship with individuals. The response effectively discusses the significance of being called by name in fostering a sense of connection and purpose within the divine plan. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by explicitly emphasizing God's specific choice and personal knowledge of each individual, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher."
