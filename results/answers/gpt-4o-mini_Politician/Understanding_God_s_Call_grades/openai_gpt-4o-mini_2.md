When the Bible states that God has called us by name, it conveys a deeply personal and intimate relationship between God and individuals. This phrase suggests that each person is uniquely recognized and valued by God, emphasizing the idea that everyone has a specific purpose and significance in the divine plan.

This concept appears in various biblical passages, such as in Isaiah 43:1, where God reassures His people of His love and care.
