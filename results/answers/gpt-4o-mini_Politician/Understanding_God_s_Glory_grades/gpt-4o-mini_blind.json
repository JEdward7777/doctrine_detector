  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student has provided a well-structured and insightful comparison between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the doctrinal differences and implications of each concept. The response effectively highlights the transcendent nature of God's glory, its source, purpose, impact, and lasting significance compared to the transient nature of worldly glory. The student's articulation of how each concept affects individuals and society is commendable. However, to improve the grade, the student could have included more specific biblical references to support their points and strengthen the doctrinal foundation of the argument. Nonetheless, the overall analysis is well-executed."
