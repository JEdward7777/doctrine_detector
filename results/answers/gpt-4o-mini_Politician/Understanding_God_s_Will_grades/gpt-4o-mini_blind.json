  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of seeking God's will in everyday decisions, emphasizing the importance of aligning choices with divine values and teachings. The student correctly mentions reflection, prayer, meditation, and consultation of religious sources as ways to seek guidance. The answer also highlights the significance of ethical considerations, compassion, and respect in decision-making.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by emphasizing the essential role of Scripture in discerning God's will. Additionally, a more explicit mention of the importance of seeking God's will in accordance with His revealed Word would further align the response with a Christian worldview. Mentioning the need for submission to God's sovereignty and trust in His providence would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
