  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of seeking God's will in everyday decisions, incorporating elements of reflection, prayer, ethical considerations, and seeking guidance. However, the answer lacks a strong emphasis on aligning decisions with God's revealed will in Scripture, which is foundational in a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to place a greater emphasis on seeking God's specific desires and plans as outlined in the Bible would improve the response."
