  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a good job of explaining what it means to seek God's will in everyday decisions, including the importance of reflection, prayer, and consultation with religious texts or leaders. The discussion of considering the impact of decisions on oneself and others, as well as striving for compassion and respect, is also relevant and insightful.\n\nHowever, while this response does touch on the idea of seeking guidance from divine sources (such as \"signs or feelings that may be interpreted as divine guidance\"), it could more explicitly connect this to the concern about honoring God's desires and plans. The provided answer emphasizes the importance of understanding God's will through Scripture, which is an important consideration.\n\nOverall, while this response provides a helpful overview of seeking God's will, it could be strengthened by more directly addressing the concern about honoring God or feeling uncertain about His direction.\n\nComment: This response provides a good foundation for discussing the concept of seeking God's will, but could benefit from further development and connection to the provided answer and concern."
