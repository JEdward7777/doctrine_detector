  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful explanation of seeking God's will in everyday decisions, emphasizing the importance of aligning choices with divine values and teachings. It acknowledges the role of reflection, prayer, and consulting religious sources for guidance. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting that people may indeed struggle or feel uncertain about honoring God in decision-making. The only recommendation for improvement would be to explicitly mention the significance of seeking guidance from Scripture, as this is foundational in discerning God's will for our lives in a Christian worldview."
