  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-thought-out explanation of seeking God's will in everyday decisions, emphasizing the importance of aligning choices with divine inspiration and values. It acknowledges the use of reflection, prayer, and consultation with religious sources for guidance. The response also touches on ethical considerations, compassion, and the variability of approaches among individuals and faith communities. The only aspect for improvement would be to specifically address the concern that people may struggle with decision-making or feel uncertain about God's direction by providing reassurance or advice from a Christian perspective."
