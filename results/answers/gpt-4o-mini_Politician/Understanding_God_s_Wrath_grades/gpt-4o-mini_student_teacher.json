  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. \n\nThe student provides a detailed and accurate comparison between God's wrath and human anger based on biblical teachings. They effectively highlight the differences in nature, purpose, and execution of God's wrath versus human anger, showcasing a strong understanding of the topic. The response is well-structured, supported by relevant biblical references, and demonstrates critical thinking in analyzing the nuances between the two. \n\nHowever, the student could enhance their answer by emphasizing the centrality of God's holiness and justice in understanding His wrath, aligning it more closely with the reference answer's emphasis on God's intense, righteous judgment of sin. Additionally, while the student discusses the redemptive aspect of God's wrath, they could further elaborate on how this ties into His overarching plan for restoration and reconciliation. \n\nOverall, the student provides a solid response that reflects a good grasp of the concept, but there is room for minor improvements in alignment with the specific concern provided."
