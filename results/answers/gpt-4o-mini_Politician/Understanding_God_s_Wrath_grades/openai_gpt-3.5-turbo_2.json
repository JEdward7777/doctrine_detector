It effectively emphasizes the measured and purposeful nature of God's wrath, grounding the discussion in biblical examples and principles. The response could perhaps further emphasize the redemptive aspect of God's wrath, but overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on this topic."
