## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The biblical definition of "heaven" generally refers to a spiritual realm where God resides, often associated with eternal life, peace, and communion with the divine. It is depicted as a place of reward for the righteous and is characterized by divine presence, joy, and fulfillment. Various scriptures describe heaven in different ways, often using symbolic language to convey its beauty and significance.

On the other hand, "sky" typically refers to the physical atmosphere and celestial space we observe from Earth, encompassing the air we breathe and the astronomical bodies, such as stars and planets, that we see. It is part of the natural world and does not carry the spiritual connotations found in the concept of heaven.

In summary, while "heaven" in a biblical context conveys a spiritual and eternal dimension associated with God and the afterlife, "sky" refers to the tangible, physical expanse above us. This distinction emphasizes the difference between the spiritual and the material world.
