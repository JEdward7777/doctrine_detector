  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a generally accurate explanation of the biblical definition of \"heaven\" and how it differs from the concept of \"sky.\" The student effectively describes heaven as a spiritual realm associated with God and eternal life, contrasting it with the physical atmosphere and celestial space referred to as the sky. The answer could be further enhanced by including specific biblical references to support the understanding of heaven as a place of divine presence, reward for the righteous, and eternal joy. Additionally, emphasizing the difference in nature between heaven as a spiritual realm and the sky as a physical entity could strengthen the doctrinal clarity of the response."
