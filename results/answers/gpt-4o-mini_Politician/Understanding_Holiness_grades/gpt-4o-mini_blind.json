  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of God's absolute holiness and its impact on our relationship with Him. It correctly emphasizes the importance of reverence, grace, and reconciliation in light of God's holiness. The answer could be improved by including more Scriptural references to support the points made and by reinforcing the idea that God's holiness also necessitated the atoning work of Jesus Christ for our sins. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful response."
