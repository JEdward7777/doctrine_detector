  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful and well-articulated response to the question, recognizing the significance of God's absolute holiness in shaping our relationship with Him. The answer effectively highlights the importance of reverence, self-reflection, reconciliation, and personal growth in light of God's holiness. However, the student could enhance their response by emphasizing more the inherent tension between God's holiness and our sinful nature, as outlined in the reference answer. This additional perspective would enrich the discussion of the necessary steps for approaching a holy God, aligning more closely with a Christian worldview."
