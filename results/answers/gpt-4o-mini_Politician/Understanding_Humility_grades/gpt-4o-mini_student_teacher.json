  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive understanding of humility in relation to one's relationship with God from a Christian perspective. They have captured various aspects such as dependence on God, repentance, service to others, teachability, and gratitude, which all contribute to humbling oneself before God. However, the response could be improved by focusing more on the central theme of submitting one's will to God and acknowledging His greatness, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a solid explanation with room for a bit more alignment with the specific concern provided."
