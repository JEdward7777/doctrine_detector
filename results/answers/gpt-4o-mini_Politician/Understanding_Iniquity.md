## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In the biblical context, "iniquity," "sin," and "transgression" often have overlapping meanings but can carry distinct nuances based on their usage in scripture.

1. **Sin**: This is a broad term that generally refers to any action, thought, or behavior that goes against God's commands or moral law. It can encompass a wide range of offenses, from minor mistakes to serious wrongdoings. In the biblical text, sin reflects the condition of humanity's separation from God.

2. **Transgression**: This term is often used to indicate a more willful disobedience or violation of a specific commandment. It implies crossing a boundary or exceeding a limit set by God. Transgression can be seen as a more conscious act of defiance compared to the broader concept of sin.

3. **Iniquity**: This term conveys a deeper sense of moral corruption or injustice. It is sometimes associated with the guilt or consequences of sin, as well as the inherent propensity within individuals or societies to stray from righteousness. Iniquity highlights the persistent and often systemic nature of wrongdoing.

In summary, while all three terms refer to offenses against divine law, "sin" is the overarching concept, "transgression" indicates a willful act against specific commands, and "iniquity" suggests a deeper moral failing or the ongoing nature of evil. Understanding these distinctions can enrich one's comprehension of biblical texts and their implications for ethical living.
