  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression, showing a good understanding of the nuances of each term. The student effectively highlights the overlaps and differences between the terms based on their usage in Scripture. However, the teacher's answer emphasizes that iniquity specifically refers to deliberate acts of great wickedness, which was not as clearly articulated in the student's response. Despite this minor discrepancy, the student demonstrates a solid grasp of the concepts and their significance for ethical living."
