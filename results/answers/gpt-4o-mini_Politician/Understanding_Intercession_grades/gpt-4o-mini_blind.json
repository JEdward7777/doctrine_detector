The references to Romans 8:26-27, John 14:16-17, 1 Corinthians 2:10-13, and Galatians 4:6 accurately demonstrate the Holy Spirit's role as an advocate, helper, revealer of truths, and facilitator of intimate communication with God. The explanation is clear and supported by relevant Scriptural evidence. Great job connecting the verses to the broader concept of intercession."
