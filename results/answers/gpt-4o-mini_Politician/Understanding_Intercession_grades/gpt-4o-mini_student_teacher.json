They effectively explained how the Holy Spirit assists believers in prayer and strengthens their relationship with God. However, the student could further deepen their answer by emphasizing the direct involvement of the Holy Spirit in interceding for believers before God, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
