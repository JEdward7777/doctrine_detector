  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70. \n\nWhile the student's response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of the concept of acting justly according to God's laws, there is a lack of specificity in addressing the concern regarding biblical standards of fairness and righteousness. The student does discuss principles of fairness, equity, and righteousness, as well as advocating for social justice, but the answer could have been strengthened by directly tying these principles to specific biblical teachings or examples. \n\nOverall, the student shows a good understanding of the concept of justice within a faith context but could benefit from providing more explicit connections to biblical standards."
