It aligns well with the concern of understanding biblical standards of fairness and righteousness. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the specific biblical teachings and principles that guide individuals in acting justly according to God's laws. Additionally, referencing specific Scriptures or examples would further strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
