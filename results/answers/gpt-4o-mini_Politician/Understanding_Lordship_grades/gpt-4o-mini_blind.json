  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the significance of the term 'Lord' in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. It accurately highlights the theological depth and implications of using this title for both God and Jesus. The student could have further emphasized the Lordship of Jesus as being foundational to Christian belief and salvation, but overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
