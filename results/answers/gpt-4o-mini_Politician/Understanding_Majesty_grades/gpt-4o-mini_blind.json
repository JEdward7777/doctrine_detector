It correctly mentions God's attributes of holiness, power, and omniscience. The answer effectively conveys the awe and reverence that 'majesty' inspires among believers. Additionally, it touches on the relational aspect of God with humanity and the need for approaching Him with respect and humility. However, the answer could have further emphasized the transcendence and otherness of God in relation to His majesty."
