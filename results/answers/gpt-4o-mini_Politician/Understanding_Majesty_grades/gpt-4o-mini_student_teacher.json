  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a thorough explanation of the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character, touching upon aspects such as His attributes, sovereignty, and the impact on believers, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer encompasses a broader perspective, including God's relational aspect with humanity and the reverence believers have towards Him. Although these points are insightful and enrich the answer, the focus on God's role as the \"supreme King over the universe\" is not as prominently emphasized in the student's response as in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to deepen their analysis on God's supreme kingship and how it ties specifically to the term 'majesty' would enhance the alignment with a Christian worldview."
