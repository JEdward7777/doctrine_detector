However, it lacks explicit references to God's merciful nature as the foundation for understanding and practicing mercy. From a Christian worldview, it is essential to root the concept of mercy in God's character and teachings as exemplified through Jesus Christ. Including more direct references to biblical passages or teachings on mercy would strengthen the answer significantly. Additionally, framing mercy as an overflow of God's mercy towards us would enhance the doctrinal correctness and depth of the response."
