  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and practical list of ways to demonstrate mercy in daily life, which aligns well with the concern of encouraging individuals to embody God's merciful nature. The response effectively covers various aspects of showing mercy, such as active listening, acts of kindness, forgiveness, support, inclusivity, empathy, self-compassion, mindful communication, advocating for justice, and modeling compassionate behavior. The student's approach is thoughtful and inclusive, reflecting a deep understanding of how to apply the concept of God's mercy in practical ways. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly referencing God's kindness and compassion, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, a well-developed and insightful response."
