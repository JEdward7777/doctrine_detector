  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the concept of being \"born again\" from a biblical perspective, noting its origins in the New Testament and its spiritual implications. They correctly emphasize the importance of faith, repentance, and the work of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life. The answer could be strengthened by highlighting the centrality of Jesus Christ in the process of being born again and the necessity of this transformation for salvation, as well as by providing more clarity on the distinctiveness of this experience in Christian doctrine. Additionally, the student could have included more scriptural references to support their explanation."
