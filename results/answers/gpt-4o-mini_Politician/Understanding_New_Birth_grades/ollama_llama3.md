Being "born again" is a phrase that originates from the Bible, specifically in the New Testament. It is most notably mentioned in the Gospel of John, in a conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus. In John 3:3, Jesus tells Nicodemus, "Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again."

In this context, being born again refers to a spiritual transformation and renewal. It signifies a personâ€™s acceptance of Jesus Christ and the subsequent change in their heart and mind, leading to a new way of living. This concept emphasizes the importance of faith, repentance, and the work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life.

For many Christians, being born again symbolizes a personal relationship with God, a commitment to follow Jesus, and an alignment with the teachings of Christianity. This transformation is often understood as essential for salvation and a life that reflects love, compassion, and service to others.

Overall, the concept carries deep theological significance and is viewed as a pivotal aspect of the Christian faith. It is always important to approach such discussions with sensitivity, recognizing and respecting the diverse beliefs and interpretations that people may have regarding faith and spirituality.
