The explanation is aligned with the concern about the foundational aspect of the Christian faith and presents the theological significance of this concept effectively. The only improvement could be a further elaboration on the role of repentance and the Holy Spirit in the process of being \"born again\" to deepen the understanding of the transformation experienced by believers."
