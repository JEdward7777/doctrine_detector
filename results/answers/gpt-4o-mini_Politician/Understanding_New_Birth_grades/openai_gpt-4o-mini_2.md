Being "born again" is a phrase that originates from the Bible, specifically in the New Testament. It is most notably mentioned in the Gospel of John, in a conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus. In John 3:3, Jesus tells Nicodemus, "Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again."

It signifies a personâ€™s acceptance of Jesus Christ and the subsequent change in their heart and mind, leading to a new way of living. This concept emphasizes the importance of faith, repentance, and the work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life.

For many Christians, being born again symbolizes a personal relationship with God, a commitment to follow Jesus, and an alignment with the teachings of Christianity. This transformation is often understood as essential for salvation and a life that reflects love, compassion, and service to others.
