  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a solid explanation of what it means to 'perish' in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament, addressing the aspect of separation from God and the contrast with salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The answer is well-written, shows understanding of the topic, and offers relevant scriptural references. However, there is room for improvement in directly connecting the concept of 'perishing' with the idea of spiritual separation from God, as highlighted in the reference answer. Strengthening this connection would enhance the overall coherence and depth of the response."
