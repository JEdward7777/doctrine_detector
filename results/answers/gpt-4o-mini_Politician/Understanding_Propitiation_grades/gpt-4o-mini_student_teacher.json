  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive answer touching on theological, ethical, and relational dimensions of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of propitiation, which is commendable. However, the student's explanation lacks a clear emphasis on how Jesus' sacrifice specifically relates to satisfying God's justice and appeasing His wrath, as highlighted in the reference answer. To fully align with a Christian worldview, a clearer connection to God's justice and mercy within the concept of propitiation is needed."
