  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response adequately addresses the concern by providing a clear explanation of how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy. The writer correctly emphasizes that Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath, which is in line with the provided answer. The additional information about theological reconciliation, ethical modeling, and relational aspects also adds depth to the response.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 10 points because the response does not explicitly state how propitiation relates to God's mercy. While it mentions that Jesus' sacrifice provides a means for sinners to receive forgiveness and eternal life, this connection is not fully developed or explicitly linked to propitiation. Additionally, some of the supporting points, such as the relational aspect, while relevant, are somewhat tangential to the main concern.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of propitiation and its significance in Christian theology. With further development and connection-making, it could be even more effective in addressing the concern."
