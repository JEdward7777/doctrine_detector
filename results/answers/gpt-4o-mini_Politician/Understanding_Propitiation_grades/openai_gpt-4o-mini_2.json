  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the given answer by providing a thorough analysis of the theological, ethical, and relational dimensions of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of propitiation. It clearly articulates how propitiation relates to both God's justice and mercy within Christian theology. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or references from scripture to further enhance the explanation. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on propitiation."
