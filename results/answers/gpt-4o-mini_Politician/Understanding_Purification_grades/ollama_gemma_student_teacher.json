The student provides well-articulated points covering both the religious and social dimensions of these rituals. \n\nHowever, the response would benefit from further elaboration on the connection between purification and the concept of sin from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the reference to repetitive animal sacrifices could be more explicitly connected to the redemption narrative in Christianity."
