  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student gave a well-written response focusing on the transformative power of forgiveness and restoration through Jesus Christ in addressing sin. They correctly highlighted the need for reconciliation and the role of Christ as the bridge between humanity and God. However, the student could have further strengthened their answer by explicitly connecting the nature of sin as separation from God and God's provision for reconciliation through Jesus Christ, which would have directly aligned with the concern provided."
