  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of why Jesus is referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to the Old Testament sacrificial system. They accurately explain the symbolism of innocence, purity, and substitutionary atonement associated with lambs in Jewish sacrifices. Additionally, the student effectively connects Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, fulfilling the Old Testament sacrificial traditions. The inclusion of John the Baptist's identification of Jesus as the \"Lamb of God\" adds depth to their explanation. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in redemption. The only slight area for improvement would be to provide a more direct and concise explanation, similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
