It effectively connects Jesus' sacrificial role to the Old Testament sacrificial system and how His sacrifice fulfills God's plan for redemption. The student effectively addresses the concern by offering a Christian-specific perspective on the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption. However, a stronger emphasis on the unique and central Christian belief in Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins could have further enhanced the response."
