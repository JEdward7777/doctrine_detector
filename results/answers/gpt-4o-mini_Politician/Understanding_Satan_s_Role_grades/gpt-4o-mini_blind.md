In the context of the Christian faith, the name 'Satan' signifies an adversarial figure who represents opposition to God's will and goodness. Traditionally viewed as the embodiment of temptation and sin, Satan is often depicted as a tempter, leading individuals away from righteousness and into moral conflict. The name itself originates from a Hebrew term meaning "adversary" or "accuser."

Throughout various scriptural texts, Satan is portrayed in different roles, including that of a deceiver and adversary, as well as an entity that tests the faith of believers. Many Christian teachings emphasize the importance of resisting such temptations and remaining steadfast in faith and morality.
