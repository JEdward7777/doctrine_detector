However, the student could have delved deeper into the specific origins of the term as mentioned in the reference answer provided. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the omnipotence and sovereignty of God as revealed through the term \"Shaddai\" would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
