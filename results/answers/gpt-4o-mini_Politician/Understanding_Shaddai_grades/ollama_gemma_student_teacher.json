The student accurately explains its common translation as \"Almighty\" and emphasizes its association with God's omnipotence. Additionally, the student provides relevant examples from the biblical text to support their claims. The inclusion of the duality of strength and care is also a thoughtful and nuanced interpretation of the term."
