  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a well-thought-out response that demonstrates a clear understanding of how the concepts of trespass and sin relate in a Christian worldview. They effectively explain the significance of both concepts and how they reflect moral failings in relation to divine law and social conduct. However, the student could improve by emphasizing the centrality of God in defining sin and trespass, as noted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a strong response with room for minor improvement."
