  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student's answer provides thoughtful reflections on societal behaviors that can be considered unethical or harmful. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the answer misses the mark by not addressing the core aspect of what defines an \"unholy\" life according to Christian beliefs. The Christian perspective views an 'unholy' life as one that goes against God's will and dishonors Him, rather than just societal norms. The student should have incorporated this key aspect and provided examples specifically related to rebellion against God or actions that dishonor Him to align the answer with a Christian worldview."
