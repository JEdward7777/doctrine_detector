  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments, addressing the emotions, warnings, and calls to reflection associated with it. However, the student could strengthen their answer by emphasizing the connection between \"woe\" and the consequences of sin as a form of divine judgment, as highlighted in the reference answer. This additional focus would align the response more closely with a Christian-specific worldview on the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment."
