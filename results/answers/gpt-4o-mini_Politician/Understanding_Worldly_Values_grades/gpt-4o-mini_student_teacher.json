  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50 \n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-rounded understanding of the concept of being \"worldly\" in Christian teachings, focusing on the contrast between secular/material pursuits and spiritual/divine principles. However, the student's answer lacks specificity in highlighting the negative connotations associated with being \"worldly\" according to Christian teachings. The reference answer emphasizes the evil values and behaviors associated with worldliness which the student's response does not address adequately. The student should further emphasize the importance of rejecting worldly values in favor of godly principles in order to align more closely with a Christian worldview."
