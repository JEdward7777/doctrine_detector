  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning that worldly values can imply a focus on material pursuits and societal norms, which can distract individuals from their spiritual commitments. It also highlights the importance of exploring the contrast between worldly values and godly principles. However, it does not fully capture the nuance and complexity of Christian teachings on this topic.\n\nThe response's understanding of \"worldly\" as solely referring to evil values and behaviors is too narrow and oversimplifies the concept. The original response provides a more accurate and nuanced view of \"worldly\" as encompassing attitudes, behaviors, and values that are more aligned with secular or material pursuits rather than spiritual or divine principles.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples of worldly values and behaviors that contrast with godly principles. Additionally, exploring the biblical basis for these concepts and highlighting the importance of seeking values such as love, compassion, humility, and service to others would further strengthen the response."
