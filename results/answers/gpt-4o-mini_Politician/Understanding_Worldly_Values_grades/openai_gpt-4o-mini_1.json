  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"worldly\" within Christian teachings, emphasizing the contrast between worldly values and godly principles. It demonstrates an understanding of the concern provided and offers a nuanced perspective on the topic from a Christian worldview. The only slight critique is that it could have been more explicit in connecting the explanation to the specific concern provided."
