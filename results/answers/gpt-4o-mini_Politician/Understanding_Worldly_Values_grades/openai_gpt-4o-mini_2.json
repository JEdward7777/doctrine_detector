  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the term \"worldly\" in Christian teachings, emphasizing the contrast between worldly values and godly principles. It effectively addresses the concern by discussing how worldly attitudes contradict godly values such as love, compassion, and service to others. The response also highlights the importance of understanding and respecting diverse interpretations of these values. However, to improve, the response could have directly connected the explanation to the concern stated and provided more specific examples of how worldly values oppose godly principles in Christian teachings. Overall, a well-articulated and informative response from a Christian worldview perspective."
