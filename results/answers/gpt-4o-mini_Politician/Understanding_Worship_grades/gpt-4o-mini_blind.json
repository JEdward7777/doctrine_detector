However, the response lacks a strong emphasis on the importance of worship in the Christian faith specifically, such as emphasizing the centrality of worshiping God alone, in spirit and truth, as taught in the Bible. Additionally, there is no mention of the true definition of worship ascribing worth and honor to God. The answer could be improved by incorporating more Christian-specific perspectives on worship."
