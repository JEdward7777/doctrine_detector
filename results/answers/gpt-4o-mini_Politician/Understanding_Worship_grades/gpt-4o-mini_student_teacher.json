  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response provides a broad and inclusive definition of worship, encompassing various contexts beyond religious ones. However, the concern specifically emphasizes the significance of worship in a Christian's life as it reflects their relationship with God. The student's answer lacks a focus on worship as an act of honoring, praising, and obeying God in the Christian faith, which is the primary aspect of worship from a Christian worldview. The response also does not address the Christian perspective on worship as outlined in the reference answer."
