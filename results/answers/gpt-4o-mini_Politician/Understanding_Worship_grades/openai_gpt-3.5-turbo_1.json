  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a general understanding of worship but falls short in acknowledging the Christian perspective on worship as honoring, praising, and obeying God. While it recognizes that worship can extend beyond religious contexts, it does not sufficiently emphasize the significance of worship in a Christian's life as reflecting their relationship with God. A stronger integration of Christian beliefs and practices related to worship would have enhanced the response."
