While it acknowledges the personal and subjective nature of worship, it fails to emphasize the central role of worship in deepening one's relationship with God, which is crucial from a Christian worldview perspective. It could have included more direct references to scripture or Christian teachings to support the importance of worship as a reflection of one's faith and devotion to God."
