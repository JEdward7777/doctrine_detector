  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the context of the Bible. The explanation of Sheol as a place of the dead in the Old Testament and Hades in the New Testament is accurate. The student effectively differentiates between the two terms and their implications for the afterlife of the righteous and the unrighteous. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Sheol and Hades within a Christian worldview, particularly in relation to salvation and judgment. Adding more scriptural references to support the points made would have strengthened the response."
