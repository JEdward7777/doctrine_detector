  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. They demonstrate a good understanding of the evolution of these concepts within the biblical context. A slight deduction for not explicitly emphasizing the distinction between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous in the teacher's reference answer."
