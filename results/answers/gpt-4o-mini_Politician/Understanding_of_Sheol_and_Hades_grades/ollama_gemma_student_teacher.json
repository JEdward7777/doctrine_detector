  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concepts of Sheol and Hades within the Bible. They accurately explain the initial neutral understanding of both terms, before highlighting the development in New Testament literature where Hades becomes associated with the unrighteous. The inclusion of the parable of the rich man and Lazarus as an example further reinforces the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous. Overall, the answer is well-written and demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the biblical texts."
