  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the distinctions between Sheol and Hades in the biblical context, highlighting the evolution in understanding regarding the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death. The explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the theological implications of these concepts within Christian worldview. However, to improve the grade, the response could have incorporated more specific biblical references to support the discussion on the fates of the righteous and unrighteous in Sheol and Hades."
