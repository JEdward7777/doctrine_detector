  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the concepts of Sheol and Hades, drawing from biblical and historical contexts. The explanation of the evolving understanding of the afterlife and the distinction between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous is clear and well-supported. Bringing in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) to illustrate these distinctions strengthens the response. Overall, the integration of biblical references and theological insights demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
