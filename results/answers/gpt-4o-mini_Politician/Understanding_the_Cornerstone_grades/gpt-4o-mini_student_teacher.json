  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful answer that highlights various aspects of Jesus Christ as the 'cornerstone' in the context of the Assembly of believers. The student effectively connects the theological significance of Jesus as the foundation of faith with practical applications for unity, guidance, spiritual growth, and mission within the Church. However, the answer could have been further strengthened by directly addressing the concern about the impact of understanding Christ's role on faith and community involvement. Overall, a strong and well-articulated response."
