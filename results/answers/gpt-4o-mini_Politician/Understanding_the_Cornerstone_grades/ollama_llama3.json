While it does not explicitly address the concern about the significance of Christ's role impacting a believer's faith and community involvement, it indirectly touches on this aspect by emphasizing the unifying force of Jesus' principles (love, compassion, and grace) that create a sense of belonging among believers.\n\nThe response could be improved by more directly addressing the specified concern and exploring how Jesus as the cornerstone can influence a believer's faith and community engagement. Nevertheless, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding Christ's role in the church and its implications."
