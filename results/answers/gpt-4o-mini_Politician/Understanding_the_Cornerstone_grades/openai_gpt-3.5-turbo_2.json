It effectively addresses the concern by linking the significance of Christ's role to a believer's faith and community involvement, highlighting the foundational, unifying, guiding, nurturing, and mission-driven aspects of Jesus in the Assembly. The explanation is rich in Christian theology and worldview, demonstrating a deep understanding of the faith's implications in the believer's life and the broader community."
