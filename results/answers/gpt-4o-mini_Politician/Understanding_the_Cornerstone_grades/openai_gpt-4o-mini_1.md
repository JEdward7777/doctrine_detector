In the context of the Assembly of believers, often referred to as the Church, Jesus Christ is seen as the 'cornerstone' in both a theological and relational sense. The term 'cornerstone' highlights His foundational role in the faith and the community of believers.

1. **Foundation of Faith**: Jesus is viewed as the essential basis upon which the beliefs and practices of the Church are built. His teachings, life, death, and resurrection are central to the Christian faith and inform the beliefs that unite the Assembly of believers.

2. **Unity and Cohesion**: The 'cornerstone' symbolizes the unifying force that brings diverse individuals together. In many interpretations, Jesus embodies the principles of love, compassion, and grace, which serve to create a sense of belonging and community among believers, regardless of their backgrounds.

3. **Guidance and Direction**: As the cornerstone, Jesus provides a model for ethical behavior and decision-making within the Assembly. His example encourages believers to strive for a life that reflects His values and serves the community and the world positively.

4. **Spiritual Growth**: Jesus is often viewed as the source of spiritual nourishment and strength for believers. The Assembly is encouraged to grow in relationship with Him, leading to personal and communal transformation.

5. **Purpose and Mission**: The cornerstone emphasizes the mission of the Church to spread the message of love, hope, and redemption that Jesus represents. This mission drives the Assembly to engage in service, outreach, and advocacy for justice and compassion in the world.

In summary, Jesus Christ as the 'cornerstone' signifies His vital role in establishing the identity, unity, purpose, and ethical framework of the Assembly of believers. This understanding promotes an inclusive environment that encourages mutual respect and understanding among all members.
