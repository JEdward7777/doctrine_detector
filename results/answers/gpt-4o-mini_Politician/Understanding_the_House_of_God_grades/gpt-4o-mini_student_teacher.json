  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-explained understanding of the term \"house of God\" in biblical context, discussing both its physical and symbolic meanings. The student appropriately references the Temple in Jerusalem and the broader concept of God dwelling within believers. However, they could have elaborated more on the specific significance of the tabernacle and temple in relation to the term, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additional clarity on the specific biblical contexts where the term is used could have further strengthened the response."
