In a biblical context, the term "house of God" generally refers to a place of worship and divine presence. It is often associated with buildings or locations where people gather to honor, worship, and seek communion with God. 

In the Hebrew Bible, for instance, the term frequently refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, which was considered the dwelling place of God among his people. This sacred space was central to Jewish worship and rituals. 

In a broader sense, "house of God" can also symbolize the community of believers, reflecting the idea that God dwells within the hearts and lives of those who follow Him. Thus, the term encompasses both physical structures and the spiritual fellowship of believers. 

Overall, the phrase signifies both reverence for God's presence and the importance of community and worship in the lives of the faithful.
