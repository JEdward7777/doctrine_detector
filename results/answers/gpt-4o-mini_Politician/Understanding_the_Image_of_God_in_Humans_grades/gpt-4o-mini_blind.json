  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 75.\n\nThe answer provides a solid overview of characteristics that reflect the image of God in human beings according to the biblical definition. The student accurately mentions key traits such as rationality, creativity, moral awareness, emotional depth, relationality, spirituality, and free will. These characteristics indeed align with the biblical understanding of humans being created in the image of God.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by further emphasizing the importance of these characteristics in light of Christian doctrine. Connecting each trait more explicitly to relevant biblical passages or theological teachings would strengthen the answer. Additionally, discussing how the Fall affected these characteristics and how redemption in Christ restores them could deepen the theological reflection.\n\nOverall, it is a good foundation, but could benefit from more explicit integration of Christian theological perspectives."
