  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer that effectively elaborated on various characteristics reflecting the image of God in human beings. They demonstrated a deep understanding of the topic by delineating specific traits and linking them to the divine attributes. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the teacher's reference answer and focusing more on the core aspects mentioned in it. Overall, the student showed a strong grasp of the biblical perspective on the image of God in humanity."
