However, the response could be strengthened by incorporating more specific biblical references or doctrinal teachings related to the \"last days\" and the two comings of Jesus. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of personal repentance and faith in preparing for Christ's return would align more closely with traditional Christian beliefs. Overall, a good foundation, but could benefit from deeper theological exploration."
