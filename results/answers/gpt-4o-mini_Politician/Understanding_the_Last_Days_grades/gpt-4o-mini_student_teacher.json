  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the \"last days\" in relation to both Jesus' first and second comings, they do not clearly state that the \"last days\" refer to the time period beginning with Jesus' first coming and concluding with His second coming and the final day of judgment. This is an important theological point that aligns with a Christian worldview. The student's answer is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the theological implications, but it falls slightly short of fully incorporating the specific concern provided."
