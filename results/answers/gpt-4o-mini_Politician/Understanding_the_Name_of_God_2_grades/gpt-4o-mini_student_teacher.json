  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and detailed explanation of the significance of the name \"Yahweh\" in the context of the Old Testament. They accurately conveyed the themes associated with the name and its importance in reflecting God's nature and relationship with His people. However, the student's answer included additional information beyond the reference answer, such as mentioning the use of \"LORD\" in translations and the historical context of the name, which though informative, was not directly relevant to the question. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic was demonstrated."
