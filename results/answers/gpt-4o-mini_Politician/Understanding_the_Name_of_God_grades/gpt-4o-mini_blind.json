  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the name 'Yahweh' in the Old Testament, touching on key theological themes such as covenantal relationship, divine self-revelation, holiness, and God's nature. The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of Yahweh's importance in the biblical narrative and its cultural context. The student could further enhance the answer by incorporating more scriptural references to support their points and deepen the theological analysis."
