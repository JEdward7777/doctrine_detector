  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the differentiation between the human spirit and evil spirits in the Bible, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic. The answer effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the distinction between personal spiritual identity and malevolent spiritual influences. The student's response aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, but could have been improved by incorporating more direct references to biblical verses that explicitly differentiate between the human spirit and evil spirits. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful answer deserving of a high grade."
