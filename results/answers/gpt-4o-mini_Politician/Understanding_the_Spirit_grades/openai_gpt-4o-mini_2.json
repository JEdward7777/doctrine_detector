  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and well-supported explanation of the distinction between personal spiritual identity (human spirit) and malevolent spiritual influences (evil spirits) based on biblical principles. The student effectively articulates the nature and role of each concept, drawing on relevant scripture passages to support their points. The response could be further enhanced by elaborating on the consequences of yielding to evil spirits and the importance of spiritual discernment in recognizing and resisting malevolent influences."
