They effectively explore the various layers of meaning associated with this title, such as emphasizing Jesus' humanity, messianic role, divine authority, and inclusivity. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer as the student elaborates more extensively on the inclusivity aspect and how the title resonates with a broad audience. While this additional perspective adds depth to the discussion, it slightly detracts from the primary focus on Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is the core significance of the title. Overall, a commendable response with insightful analysis."
