The title "Son of Man" is deeply significant in understanding Jesus' identity within the Christian tradition. It appears frequently in the Gospels, where Jesus uses it to refer to Himself. This title carries several layers of meaning:

1. **Humanity**: The phrase "Son of Man" emphasizes Jesus' human nature. It highlights the idea that He shares in the human experience, including suffering and mortality, making Him relatable to people.

2. **Messianic Role**: In a biblical context, "Son of Man" is often associated with prophetic visions, particularly in the Book of Daniel (Daniel 7:13-14), where it denotes a figure with authority who will establish God's kingdom. This connection suggests that Jesus embodies the fulfillment of messianic prophecies.

3. **Divine Authority**: While the title emphasizes His humanity, it also points to His divine authority. By using this title, Jesus asserts His role in the divine plan of salvation and His authority over spiritual matters.

4. **Inclusivity**: The term resonates with a broad audience, as it does not alienate those who may find more traditional titles like "Messiah" or "Christ" less relatable. It encompasses all of humanity, inviting everyone to engage with His teachings.

Overall, "Son of Man" serves to illustrate the dual nature of Jesus as both fully human and fully divine, while affirming His mission to bring hope and redemption to all humankind. This multifaceted identity is central to Christian theology and provides a framework for understanding His life and ministry.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' within the Christian tradition. They effectively explore the various layers of meaning associated with this title, such as emphasizing Jesus' humanity, messianic role, divine authority, and inclusivity. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer as the student elaborates more extensively on the inclusivity aspect and how the title resonates with a broad audience. While this additional perspective adds depth to the discussion, it slightly detracts from the primary focus on Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is the core significance of the title. Overall, a commendable response with insightful analysis.
