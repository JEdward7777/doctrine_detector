The title "Son of Man" is deeply significant in understanding Jesus' identity within the Christian tradition. It appears frequently in the Gospels, where Jesus uses it to refer to Himself. This title carries several layers of meaning:

1. **Humanity**: The phrase "Son of Man" emphasizes Jesus' human nature. It highlights the idea that He shares in the human experience, including suffering and mortality, making Him relatable to people.

2. **Messianic Role**: In a biblical context, "Son of Man" is often associated with prophetic visions, particularly in the Book of Daniel (Daniel 7:13-14), where it denotes a figure with authority who will establish God's kingdom. This connection suggests that Jesus embodies the fulfillment of messianic prophecies.

3. **Divine Authority**: While the title emphasizes His humanity, it also points to His divine authority. By using this title, Jesus asserts His role in the divine plan of salvation and His authority over spiritual matters.

4. **Inclusivity**: The term resonates with a broad audience, as it does not alienate those who may find more traditional titles like "Messiah" or "Christ" less relatable. It encompasses all of humanity, inviting everyone to engage with His teachings.

Overall, "Son of Man" serves to illustrate the dual nature of Jesus as both fully human and fully divine, while affirming His mission to bring hope and redemption to all humankind. This multifaceted identity is central to Christian theology and provides a framework for understanding His life and ministry.
