  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept of the Trinity and has explained it in a clear and respectful manner. The explanation provided aligns with orthodox Christian teaching on the Trinity, emphasizing the unity of God in three persons. The use of the analogy of water (liquid, ice, steam) while common, can have limitations as all analogies do when portraying the Trinity. The student showed a good balance between simplicity and depth in their explanation."
