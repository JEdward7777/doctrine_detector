However, the response falls short of fully emphasizing the seriousness of the spiritual ramifications of living in disobedience to God as implied by the concern. It provides a general overview without delving deeply into the specific Christian perspective on this topic. A stronger emphasis on the biblical teachings regarding judgment and wrath for ungodly behavior would have been beneficial."
