  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that highlights the use of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments to convey theological meanings and describe God's character. They have also correctly noted the significance of referring to Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament, emphasizing His divinity and sinlessness. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus, although it could have elaborated further on the specific implications of Jesus being referred to as the \"Holy One\" in terms of His unique role as the Son of God."
