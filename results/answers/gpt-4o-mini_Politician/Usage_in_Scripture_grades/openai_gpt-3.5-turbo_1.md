# Answer by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
The term "Holy One" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to convey significant theological meanings and to describe aspects of God's character, as well as to refer to certain individuals in a sacred context. 

In the Old Testament, "Holy One" is often used to refer to God, emphasizing His purity, separateness, and moral perfection. For example:
- In the Psalms, God is referred to as the "Holy One of Israel" (e.g., Psalm 30:4, Psalm 78:41), underscoring His unique relationship with the nation of Israel and His divine authority.
- The phrase is also found in the writings of the prophets, such as in Isaiah, where it emphasizes God's holiness and the call for His people to recognize and respond to that holiness.

In the New Testament, the term continues to carry this sense of divine holiness:
- Jesus is referred to as the "Holy One" in instances such as in Acts 3:14, where Peter refers to Jesus as the "Holy One and the Just" in contrast to Barabbas, highlighting Jesus' sinlessness and divine nature.
- The term is also used to emphasize the set-apart nature of Jesus' ministry and the call to His followers to pursue holiness in their lives.

Overall, "Holy One" serves as a vital descriptor of both God's nature and the nature of Jesus Christ, signifying their purity, uniqueness, and the ethical standards expected from believers. It is important to approach these texts with care and a consideration of their historical and cultural contexts to understand their full implications.
