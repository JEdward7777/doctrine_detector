The response accurately highlighted myrrh's role in anointing the body and its importance in honoring the deceased. Additionally, the student connected the use of myrrh to significant spiritual narratives, demonstrating a solid understanding of the cultural and religious contexts surrounding burial practices in biblical times. The only minor improvement could be a more explicit mention of myrrh's preservative properties, as indicated in the reference answer."
