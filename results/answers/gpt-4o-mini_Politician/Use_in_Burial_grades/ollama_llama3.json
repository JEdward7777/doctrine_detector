  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of myrrh's significance in biblical times, specifically in the context of burial practices. It effectively highlights the cultural and religious beliefs surrounding death and the afterlife during that era. The use of specific examples from the New Testament further supports the importance of myrrh in these customs.\n\nWhile the response does not directly address the concern about recognizing customs surrounding burial practices, it implicitly acknowledges this by exploring the cultural context in which myrrh was used. This shows an understanding of the significance of understanding cultural customs when interpreting scripture.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more explicitly connected to the concern about recognizing customs surrounding burial practices. However, the response still demonstrates a good grasp of the topic and effectively conveys its importance in biblical times."
