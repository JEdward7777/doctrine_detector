It correctly distinguishes between their roles in relation to the title. However, it could benefit from further elaboration and a deeper exploration of the theological significance of Jesus being referred to as \"Rabbi\" compared to John the Baptist. Additionally, the answer could have highlighted the unique authority Jesus had as the ultimate Rabbi and Son of God."
