  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nThe student accurately discusses the context of the title \"Rabbi\" and provides information on the roles of both John the Baptist and Jesus in relation to teaching and spiritual authority. However, there is some room for improvement in directly addressing the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The student could have further emphasized the reverence and impact of their teachings on their followers and the broader religious community. Additionally, the answer could have been more concise and focused on directly answering the concern provided."
