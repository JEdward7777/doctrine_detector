  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the roles of John the Baptist and Jesus as teachers. It accurately acknowledges that both figures were sometimes referred to as \"Rabbi\" by their disciples. The response also shows an understanding of the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. It could have been strengthened by providing more specific scriptural references or theological insights to further support the points made."
