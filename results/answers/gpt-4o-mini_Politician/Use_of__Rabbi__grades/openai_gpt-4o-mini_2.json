The discussion on their teachings and spiritual authority is in line with the concern provided, demonstrating an understanding of the respect and authority attributed to Jesus and John in Christian teachings. However, there could have been a deeper exploration of the theological significance behind Jesus being referred to as \"Rabbi\" and how it relates to His divinity and unique role as the Messiah."
