  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The student acknowledges the traditional significance and theological implications of using the term \"Father\" when referring to God. However, the student's answer leans more towards cultural sensitivity and inclusivity rather than emphasizing the importance of theological accuracy in using the term 'Father'. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to maintain the scriptural integrity and teachings by using the term 'Father' and providing proper teaching and context to address any potential misunderstandings. Further emphasis on the significance of theological accuracy and scriptural fidelity would improve the response."
