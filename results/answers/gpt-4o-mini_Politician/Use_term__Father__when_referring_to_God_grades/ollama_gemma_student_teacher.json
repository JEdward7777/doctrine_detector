  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the theological implications and cultural sensitivity surrounding the use of the term \"Father\" when referring to God. It acknowledges the traditional significance of the term but also highlights the need for inclusivity and adaptability in language. The student offers viable alternatives and emphasizes the importance of dialogue and respect when discussing faith and spirituality. However, the answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the importance of adhering to traditional terminology when appropriate and providing more specific examples of contexts where it may be appropriate to use alternative terms."
