However, the response also emphasizes the importance of considering alternative language to be more inclusive and sensitive to diverse perspectives. While flexibility in language can be beneficial in certain contexts, it's essential to prioritize theological accuracy and scriptural message integrity to prevent dilution of core beliefs. Encouraging sensitivity and dialogue is positive, but there should be a clear emphasis on upholding foundational truths while adapting language when necessary."
