  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response an 80. While the student provides a comprehensive answer that references relevant biblical verses and interpretations, they could improve by directly highlighting the specific promise that God gives regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan as stated in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to focus on directly addressing the exact promise in their response would make it stronger from a Christian worldview perspective."
