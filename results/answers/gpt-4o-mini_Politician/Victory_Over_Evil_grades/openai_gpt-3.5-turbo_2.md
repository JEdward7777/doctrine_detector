## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [gpt-4o-mini Politician](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_Politician.md)
In many religious traditions, particularly within Christianity, there is a promise found in scripture regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan. One of the key verses often cited is Revelation 20:10, which states that Satan will be thrown into the lake of fire, signifying his final defeat and eternal separation from God and good. This is seen as a fulfillment of God's ultimate plan for justice and restoration. 

Additionally, in Genesis 3:15, it speaks of enmity between the serpent (often interpreted as a representation of Satan) and humanity, with the promise that the offspring of the woman will crush his head, which is understood as a foretelling of Christ's victory over evil.

These verses provide hope and assurance to believers of a future where good prevails over evil, and they emphasize the themes of redemption and divine justice inherent in many religious teachings.
