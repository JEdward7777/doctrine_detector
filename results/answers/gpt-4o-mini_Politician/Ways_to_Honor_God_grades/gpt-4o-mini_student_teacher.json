  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provides practical and morally positive suggestions for honoring God in daily life, their response lacks a clear focus on the foundational elements of thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and showcasing His greatness within a Christian worldview. It is important for a Christian to prioritize these core aspects of faith alongside the practical actions mentioned in the student's answer."
