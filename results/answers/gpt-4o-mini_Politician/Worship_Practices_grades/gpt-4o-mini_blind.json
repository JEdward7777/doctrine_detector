  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provides a decent overview of modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God. The examples given are relevant and accurately reflect common pitfalls in contemporary society. However, the response could be improved by explicitly linking these modern idols to biblical teachings on idolatry and by emphasizing the importance of discernment and repentance in overcoming idolatrous tendencies. Additionally, a more robust integration of Christian scripture and theology would strengthen the analysis. Great effort overall, but more depth from a Christian worldview perspective is needed for a higher grade."
