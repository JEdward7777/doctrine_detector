  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful and thorough response that includes relevant examples of modern idols that individuals, including Christians, may prioritize over their faith. The answer demonstrates an understanding of the concern by emphasizing the importance of reflecting on personal values and priorities. However, the answer could have explicitly tied each modern idol mentioned back to how it can hinder a devoted relationship with God, in alignment with a Christian worldview. A stronger connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher would have enhanced the response."
