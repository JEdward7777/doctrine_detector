  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thoughtful response that effectively addresses the concern of idolatry within a Christian worldview. The student provides clear examples of modern idols and their potential to overshadow faith. The response also demonstrates sensitivity towards diverse beliefs and encourages reflection rather than judgment. The inclusion of a discussion about fostering dialogue promotes a deeper understanding of personal values and priorities."
