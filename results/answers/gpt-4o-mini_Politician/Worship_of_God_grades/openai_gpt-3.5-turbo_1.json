The incorporation of relevant biblical references adds depth and supports the Christian worldview perspective on worship. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique relational aspect of worshiping God and the intrinsic purpose for which humans were created, as well as highlighted the transformative power of worshiping the true God in shaping one's identity and actions."
