The detailed points on the divine presence, atonement, theological implications, and covenantal relationship demonstrate a solid understanding of the spiritual and theological significance of the atonement lid within the Christian worldview. The only room for improvement would be to perhaps provide a bit more scriptural references to support the theological reflections presented."
