  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student effectively links the term 'unfaithful' to the concept of marriage within a Christian worldview, discussing the covenantal nature of marriage, the sin of adultery, the symbolic representation of spiritual unfaithfulness, and the themes of restoration and forgiveness. They make strong connections between the breach of marital fidelity and the broader theological implications of unfaithfulness in the context of God's relationship with His people.\n\nThe student's response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, demonstrating a clear understanding of the importance of loyalty and faithfulness in both spiritual and marital commitments from a Christian perspective."
