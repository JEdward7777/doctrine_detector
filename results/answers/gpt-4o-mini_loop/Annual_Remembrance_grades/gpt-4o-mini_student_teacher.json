They effectively explained the reasons for celebrating Passover annually, emphasizing remembrance, instruction, covenant relationship, and commemoration of God's faithfulness. The answer aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer, adding additional insights and explanations. The response effectively integrates Christian worldview principles by highlighting the importance of trusting in God's provision and power, passing down faith to future generations, and reinforcing the covenant relationship between God and His people. Great job!"
