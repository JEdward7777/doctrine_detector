It effectively connects the practice of Passover to the Christian faith's emphasis on remembrance, highlighting how the event serves as a powerful tool for transmitting faith and history to future generations. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie in the Christian perspective on remembrance and how the principles of Passover can be applied to contemporary Christian beliefs and practices."
