## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover annually as a means of remembering and commemorating their deliverance from slavery in Egypt. This celebration was instituted by God, as described in the book of Exodus (Exodus 12:1-14), during the decisive moment when He executed judgment on Egypt by striking down the firstborn while sparing the Israelites who marked their doorposts with the blood of a lamb. This act symbolized God’s protection and deliverance of His people.

The annual Passover celebration served several important purposes:

1. **Remembrance of Deliverance**: It provided the Israelites an opportunity to reflect on how God miraculously freed them from oppression. The event was a powerful reminder of their identity as God's chosen people and emphasized the importance of trusting in His provision and power.

2. **Instruction for Future Generations**: Passover was designed as a teaching tool for parents to explain to their children the significance of the Exodus events. In Exodus 12:26-27, it is noted that when children inquire about the meaning of Passover, parents are to recount the story of God's deliverance, thus passing down their faith and history.

3. **Covenant Relationship**: Celebrating Passover reinforced the covenant between God and His people. It served as a reminder of their commitment to obey Him and to live in accordance with His laws, reinforcing the bond of trust and devotion.

4. **Commemoration of God’s Faithfulness**: The observance of Passover each year allowed the Israelites to acknowledge God's faithfulness in their past and His ongoing commitment to them as they journeyed through the wilderness and into the Promised Land.

Therefore, the regular observance of Passover was both a profound act of worship and a means of fostering a communal identity among the Israelites, promoting a shared sense of history and unity as God's chosen people.
