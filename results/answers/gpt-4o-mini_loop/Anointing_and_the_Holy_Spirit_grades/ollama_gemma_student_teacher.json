The student clearly explains the symbolic significance of anointing in both the Old and New Testaments, and how it relates to the empowerment of individuals for specific tasks and the overall mission of the Church. The inclusion of specific biblical references and explanations reinforces the theological basis for the connection between anointing and the Holy Spirit."
