The student accurately identifies the core beliefs that define a person as an antichrist, highlighting the denial of Jesus as the Christ and the rejection of the Father-Son relationship as central to this designation. The explanation is clear and supported by relevant scripture references, showcasing a strong grasp of the doctrinal principles outlined in John's Epistles. Well done!"
