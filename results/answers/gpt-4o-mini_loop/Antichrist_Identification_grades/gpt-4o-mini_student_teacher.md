## [Answer](../Antichrist_Identification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the writings attributed to the Apostle John, particularly in his First Epistle (1 John 2:18-22), the term "antichrist" is defined in relation to one's beliefs about Jesus Christ. John identifies antichrists as those who deny that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah) and reject the relationship between the Father and the Son.

Specifically, in 1 John 2:22, John states: "Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son." Furthermore, the essence of an antichrist is reflected in their teachings and the spirit that opposes Christ. In 1 John 4:3, John explains that every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God, indicating that such a spirit embodies the spirit of the antichrist.

Overall, according to John, a person is defined as an antichrist if they reject the foundational truths about Christ's identity and His relationship to God the Father, which is essential for a genuine faith in Him.
