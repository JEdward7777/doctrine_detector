  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Apostle John's definition of an antichrist. They accurately identify the core characteristics as denial of Christ's divinity and rejection of His relationship with the Father. The inclusion of specific textual references from 1 John 2:18-22 and 4:3 strengthens the argument. The response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer and provides a concise and clear explanation."
