  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that delves deeply into the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the Gospel. They effectively connected various biblical references and theological concepts to support their points. However, the answer could benefit from a more concise and focused approach, as some points could be condensed for clarity and coherence. Additionally, while the answer is thorough, it could further emphasize the central role of the apostles in carrying out the Great Commission specifically in relation to spreading the message of salvation and the kingdom of God."
