  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive overview of the significance of Jesus sending the apostles, covering various aspects such as authority, personal experience, empowerment by the Holy Spirit, and fulfillment of prophecy. The text also highlights the role of the apostles in establishing the Church and spreading the Gospel beyond Jewish communities.\n\nThe response aligns well with the concern of understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission. It explicitly mentions Jesus' commissioning of the apostles in Matthew 28:19-20, which is a key passage in this regard. The text also emphasizes the importance of the apostles' firsthand experiences and their empowerment by the Holy Spirit, which reflects the divine plan for the spread of the Gospel.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are:\n\n1. While it provides a good overview of the significance of Jesus sending the apostles, the text could benefit from more specific examples or illustrations to support its points.\n2. The response could also delve deeper into the implications of the apostles' mission for modern-day evangelism and discipleship.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission."
