It effectively addresses forgiveness, seeking peace, restoring relationships, humility, listening, prayer, taking initiative, and reflecting Christ's love. The incorporation of relevant Bible verses enhances the Christian worldview perspective. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific examples of how each principle can be put into practice in various real-life scenarios."
