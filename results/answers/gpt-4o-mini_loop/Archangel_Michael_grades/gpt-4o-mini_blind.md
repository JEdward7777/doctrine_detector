## [Answer](../Archangel_Michael.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The only angel referred to specifically as an "archangel" in the Bible is Michael. This designation appears in Jude 1:9, which states, "But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not presume to pronounce against him a railing judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'" Michael is also mentioned in Daniel 10:13, 21 and 12:1, where he is described as a protector of Israel, and in Revelation 12:7, where he leads the angelic army against the forces of evil, highlighting his significant role in spiritual warfare and protection over God's people.
