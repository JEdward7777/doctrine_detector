  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies Michael as the only angel referred to as an \"archangel\" in the Bible, showing good understanding of this specific biblical term. The connection between recognizing Michael's unique position and its influence on understanding spiritual warfare and intercession is well-addressed. The response effectively integrates Christian worldview perspectives on angelic roles and spiritual warfare. Great job overall."
