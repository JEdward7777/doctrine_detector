## [Answer](../Ark_Location.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant was located in the Most Holy Place (also known as the Holy of Holies). This sacred chamber was the innermost section of the Tabernacle, separated from the outer chamber (the Holy Place) by a veil. The Ark of the Covenant contained the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod that had budded, and a pot of manna, and it was situated on the mercy seat, which represented the throne of God’s presence among His people. 

Access to the Most Holy Place was restricted; only the High Priest was permitted to enter, and he could do so only once a year on the Day of Atonement to offer sacrifices for the sins of the people. This significant aspect of worship underscored the idea of God's holiness and the need for atonement in the relationship between God and Israel. The details of the Tabernacle's structure and the role of the Ark can be found in the books of Exodus and Leviticus in the Old Testament, illustrating God’s desire to dwell among His people while maintaining His holiness.
