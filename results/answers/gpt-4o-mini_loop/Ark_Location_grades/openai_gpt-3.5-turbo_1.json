It effectively elaborates on the restricted access to this sacred chamber, the role of the High Priest, and the theological implications of God's holiness and atonement. The integration of Old Testament Scripture references enhances the Christian worldview perspective on the Tabernacle and God's desire to dwell among His people while maintaining His holiness."
