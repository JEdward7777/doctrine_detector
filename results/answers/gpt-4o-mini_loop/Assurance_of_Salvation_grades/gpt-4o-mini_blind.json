The student has effectively drawn from relevant Biblical passages to support each assurance listed. The language is clear, the points are well-structured, and the key doctrines of eternal life, forgiveness of sins, indwelling of the Holy Spirit, security in Christ, peace, assurance, and future hope are all appropriately addressed. The inclusion of scriptural references adds credibility to the response, reinforcing the doctrinal correctness of the content. Great work overall."
