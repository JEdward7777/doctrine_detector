## [Answer](../Assurance_of_Salvation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Those who believe in Jesus are given several assurances according to Christian theology, primarily drawn from the New Testament. Here are some key assurances:

1. **Eternal Life**: One of the most fundamental assurances is the promise of eternal life. Jesus Himself states in John 3:16 (NIV), "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This verse emphasizes that belief in Jesus leads to eternal communion with God.

2. **Forgiveness of Sins**: Believers are assured that their sins are forgiven through faith in Jesus. In Acts 10:43 (NIV), it is declared, "All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name." This means that through Jesusâ€™ sacrifice, believers can have their sins washed away.

3. **Indwelling of the Holy Spirit**: Those who believe in Jesus receive the Holy Spirit, who empowers and guides them. In John 14:17 (NIV), Jesus promises that the Spirit "lives with you and will be in you." This assurance provides comfort and strength to lead a Christian life, helping believers navigate their spiritual journey.

4. **Security in Christ**: Believers can rest in the knowledge that their relationship with God is secure. Jesus states in John 10:28-29 (NIV), "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand." This emphasizes the unwavering security of the believer in Christ and the assurance of His protection.

5. **Peace and Assurance**: Believing in Jesus brings a profound peace that transcends circumstances. Philippians 4:7 (NIV) speaks of "the peace of God, which transcends all understanding," guarding the hearts and minds of those in Christ Jesus. This peace offers encouragement during difficult times.

6. **A Future Hope**: Believers are assured of a future hope and resurrection. In 1 Peter 1:3-5 (NIV), it states that believers have been given "new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." This promise includes an inheritance that is imperishable, kept in heaven for them, reinforcing the assurance of eternal life.

These assurances form the foundation of faith for Christians, providing comfort, hope, and direction in their spiritual journey, highlighting the profound love and grace of God through Jesus Christ.
