**What is meant by 'divine authority' and its significance in the life of a believer?**

'Divine authority' refers to the power and right that God has to command and govern all creation, including moral orders, spiritual realities, and human affairs. In Christian theology, this concept is rooted in the belief that God is the ultimate source of truth, law, and righteousness. Here are a few key points regarding its significance in the life of a believer:

1. **Source of Guidance**: Divine authority provides the foundation for a believer's moral and ethical decisions. It is through Scripture, which Christians regard as inspired by God, that they receive guidance on how to live a life that is pleasing to Him (2 Timothy 3:16-17).

2. **Establishing Truth**: Believers trust in divine authority to define truth and reality. In a world filled with conflicting beliefs and moral relativism, Christians turn to the Bible to discern what is true (John 17:17).

3. **Accountability**: Recognizing God's authority means that believers understand they are accountable to Him for their actions. This awareness fosters a sense of responsibility and encourages them to seek righteousness (Romans 14:10-12).

4. **Empowerment for Living**: Divine authority is also seen as a source of strength. Believers often rely on God’s power to guide, sustain, and empower them in their everyday lives, particularly in trials and temptations (Philippians 4:13).

5. **Creating Community and Order**: In the context of the Church, divine authority influences how communities of believers relate to one another. It shapes leadership, governance, and the body of Christ’s collective mission (Ephesians 4:11-13).

6. **Encouragement of Faith and Hope**: Knowing that God holds ultimate authority offers believers hope amid uncertainty. They can trust that God is sovereign and that His plans will ultimately prevail (Jeremiah 29:11).

In summary, divine authority plays a crucial role in how believers understand their relationship with God, approach moral decision-making, interact within their faith community, and find strength and hope in their spiritual journeys.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive understanding of divine authority, its significance in the life of a believer, and its relevance to Christian living. It effectively explores six key points that demonstrate how divine authority shapes believers' moral decisions, relationships with God, interactions within their faith community, and experiences with uncertainty. The text also incorporates relevant biblical passages, which further strengthens the argument.

The response is strong, but not perfect. While it provides a thorough explanation of divine authority, there are moments where the language could be more precise or nuanced. Additionally, some points could be developed further to provide a more detailed understanding. Overall, however, this response is excellent and well-structured, providing a clear and compelling case for the importance of divine authority in Christian living.

The concern about discerning God's will and maintaining obedience is also effectively addressed throughout the response, which highlights its significance in believers' faith journeys.
