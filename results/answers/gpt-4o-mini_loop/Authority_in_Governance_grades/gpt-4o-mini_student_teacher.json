  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-supported answer that explores various biblical passages related to the authority of governing rulers. They effectively outline the responsibilities of citizens towards authorities, emphasizing the need for obedience and respect. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern provided, which centers on understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. The mention of civil disobedience and the balance between obeying God and rulers is valuable, but a clearer connection to the central concern would enhance the response."
