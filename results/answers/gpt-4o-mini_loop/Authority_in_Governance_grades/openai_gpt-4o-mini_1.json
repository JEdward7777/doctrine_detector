It effectively addresses the concern raised in the prompt, showcasing a clear understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to also mention the importance of discernment in cases where obedience to authorities conflicts with obedience to God's commands, as this aspect was highlighted in the provided response."
