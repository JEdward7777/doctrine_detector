  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, correctly highlighting the significance of their commissioning by Jesus Christ and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. The response provides specific biblical examples to support its claims, such as the Great Commission in Matthew 28:18-20 and the events of Pentecost in Acts 2.\n\nThe only area where this response falls short is in failing to explicitly state that the apostles' authority was not limited to their time period, but rather has been passed down through the generations to the Church today. However, this omission does not detract significantly from the overall quality and relevance of the response.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical account and effectively explores the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry. The inclusion of specific examples and the emphasis on the significance of the Holy Spirit's role in the apostles' ministry are particularly noteworthy."
