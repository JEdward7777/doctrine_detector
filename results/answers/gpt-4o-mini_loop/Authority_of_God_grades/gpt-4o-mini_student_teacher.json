They effectively highlighted key theological truths conveyed by this title, demonstrating a strong understanding of the concept. The integration of scriptural references and theological implications reflects a deep insight into the topic. Overall, the student's answer aligns closely with the reference answer and effectively addresses the concern of understanding God's authority to deepen faith and trust in His omnipotence. Great job!"
