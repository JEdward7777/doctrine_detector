  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and well-structured explanation of how the title \"King of the Jews\" demonstrates Jesus' authority over all creation from a Christian worldview. The student effectively connects various scriptural references and theological concepts to support their arguments. The response could benefit from a bit more emphasis on the uniqueness of Jesus as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, highlighting His exclusive role in salvation and judgment. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound analysis."
