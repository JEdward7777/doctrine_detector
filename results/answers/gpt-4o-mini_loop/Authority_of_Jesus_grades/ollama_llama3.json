  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive analysis of the title \"King of the Jews\" in relation to Jesus' authority, covering various aspects such as fulfillment of prophecy, rejection by human authority, universal kingdom, sovereign rule over creation, redemptive purpose, atonement, and final judgment. The writer effectively weaves together biblical references from different books (e.g., Isaiah, Jeremiah, Matthew, John) to support their claims.\n\nThe response also addresses the concern of understanding Jesus' authority in a way that is relevant to believers. It highlights how recognizing Jesus as King helps people acknowledge His sovereignty in their lives and invites them to participate in His redemptive work.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the language and structure, which could be more concise and organized. Some points are repeated or could be combined for greater clarity. Nevertheless, the content is rich and accurate, making this response an excellent example of how to explore Jesus' authority from a biblical perspective.\n\nGrade: 95"
