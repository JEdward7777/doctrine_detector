It effectively addresses the concern by showing how understanding Jesus' authority leads believers to acknowledge His sovereignty in their lives. The explanation is thorough, supported by Biblical references, and demonstrates a strong grasp of Christian theology. Overall, an excellent response that aligns well with a Christian perspective."
