The writer effectively demonstrates how understanding Jesus' authority can impact believers' recognition of His sovereignty in their lives, aligning well with the specified concern. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the personal application of acknowledging Jesus' authority on an individual level for believers."
