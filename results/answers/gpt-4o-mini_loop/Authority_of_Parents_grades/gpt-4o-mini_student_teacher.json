  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer with multiple relevant Bible verses that highlight the authority of parents over their children within a Christian framework. The student effectively connected these verses to the concept of parental authority and responsibility. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the Biblical basis for parental authority within the context of obedience and family dynamics. The additional verses provided by the student further enrich the explanation, but the focus could have been more on emphasizing Ephesians 6:1-3 as the core Biblical basis for parental authority to align more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
