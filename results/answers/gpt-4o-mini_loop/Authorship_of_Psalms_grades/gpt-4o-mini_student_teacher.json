  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of key figures involved in writing the Psalms, going beyond the reference answer by including additional contributors like the Sons of Korah and Heman and Ethan. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the authorship of the Psalms and enriches the overall discussion on the diversity of voices in the Book of Psalms. However, the response could have been strengthened by providing more specific connections between the authors and the themes/messages of their respective Psalms to further enhance understanding."
