4. **Solomon**: King Solomon is attributed with writing Psalms such as Psalm 72 and Psalm 127, where his wisdom and reign are prominently reflected.

5. **Moses**: Psalm 90, attributed to Moses, stands out as one of the oldest in the Psalter, emphasizing God's eternal nature and human frailty.

6. **Heman and Ethan**: These associates are linked to specific Psalms; Psalm 88 is attributed to Heman the Ezrahite, while Psalm 89 is attributed to Ethan the Ezrahite.

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of key figures involved in writing the Psalms, going beyond the reference answer by including additional contributors like the Sons of Korah and Heman and Ethan. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the authorship of the Psalms and enriches the overall discussion on the diversity of voices in the Book of Psalms. However, the response could have been strengthened by providing more specific connections between the authors and the themes/messages of their respective Psalms to further enhance understanding.
