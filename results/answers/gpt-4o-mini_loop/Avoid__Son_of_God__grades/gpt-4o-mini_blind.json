  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 95. The student provided a clear and well-articulated response that emphasizes the importance of accurately conveying the theological significance of the term \"Son of God\" in translations, especially in polytheistic cultures. They correctly highlighted the need to preserve the doctrine of the Trinity and the uniqueness of Jesus Christ while also suggesting practical strategies for addressing potential misunderstandings. Overall, the answer demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian theology and thoughtful consideration of cultural contexts. Great job!"
