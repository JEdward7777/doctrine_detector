  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response not only agrees with the answer that the term \"Son of God\" should not be avoided, but it also provides thoughtful and biblical explanations for why this approach is necessary. The writer correctly identifies the potential risks of omitting or misunderstanding the term and offers practical suggestions for how to convey its theological significance while still being sensitive to cultural perceptions.\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is in providing more explicit connections between its points and the concern about avoidance leading to misunderstandings. While it is clear that the writer has considered this concern, the text could benefit from a more direct exploration of how avoiding or misunderstanding the term \"Son of God\" would lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the issue at hand and offers thoughtful and biblically-grounded suggestions for how to approach it."
