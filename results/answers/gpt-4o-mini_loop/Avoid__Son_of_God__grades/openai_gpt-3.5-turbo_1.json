The student correctly argues against avoiding the term due to the risk of theological gaps and misunderstandings. The suggestion to provide contextual clarifications and explanatory notes to preserve the theological significance while ensuring clarity is sound and aligns well with a Christian worldview. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern and provides a thoughtful approach to handling the translation of such a significant term."
