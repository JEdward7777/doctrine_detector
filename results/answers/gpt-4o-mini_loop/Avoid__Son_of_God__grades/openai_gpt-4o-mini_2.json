  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response presents a well-reasoned and thorough approach to the concern at hand. It appropriately emphasizes the importance of not avoiding the term \"Son of God\" while also recognizing the need for contextual clarification to prevent misconceptions. The suggestion to use phrases like \"divine Son\" or \"unique Son of God\" to convey the exclusivity and divinity of Jesus demonstrates a sound understanding of the theological implications involved. Additionally, the recommendation of providing explanatory notes or footnotes to enhance comprehension aligns with the goal of preserving the core message of the Gospel. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern by advocating for a balanced approach that maintains theological integrity while addressing potential misunderstandings."
