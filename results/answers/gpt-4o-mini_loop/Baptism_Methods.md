## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Baptism is a significant rite in the Christian faith, and the Bible mentions several methods of baptism that have been interpreted differently across various Christian traditions. Here are the primary methods and their interpretations:

1. **Immersion**: This practice involves fully submerging the person being baptized in water. The most prominent scriptural basis for immersion comes from passages such as Matthew 3:16, where Jesus is baptized by John in the Jordan River, and Acts 8:38-39, which describes the baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch, indicating they both went into the water. Churches that practice immersion, such as Baptists and many Pentecostal groups, emphasize that it symbolizes the believer’s identification with the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, as seen in Romans 6:4.

2. **Pouring (Affusion)**: This method involves pouring water over the head of the individual being baptized. While this specific action isn't explicitly detailed in the New Testament, some interpret Acts 10:47-48, where the Holy Spirit falls upon the Gentiles, as a scenario where the act of pouring can be applicable. Traditions such as Methodism and some Anglican and Lutheran denominations often practice pouring, highlighting that the symbolism of being cleansed and receiving the Holy Spirit is paramount.

3. **Sprinkling (Aspersion)**: This method includes sprinkling water on the individual and is often associated with ceremonial cleansing in the Old Testament (e.g., Hebrews 9:13). Some denominations interpret Jesus’ teachings and themes of the New Covenant to signify that physical immersion may not be as critical to the sacrament compared to the spiritual significance it conveys. Many Reformed and paedo-baptist traditions that baptize infants may use sprinkling to signify the inclusion of children into the covenant community.

4. **Symbolic Closures**: Although not a method of baptism per se, some Christian communities view baptism more symbolically, considering it an outward sign of faith rather than a requirement for salvation. For instance, some Quaker groups do not practice any form of baptism, believing that the experience of the Holy Spirit represents the true baptism, as mentioned in Matthew 3:11, where John references a baptism with the Holy Spirit.

### Variations in Interpretation:

- **Salvation and Sacramental Views**: Certain traditions, like the Catholic and Orthodox churches, regard baptism as a sacrament that imparts grace and is essential for salvation, referencing John 3:5. In contrast, many evangelical groups see baptism primarily as an act of obedience that follows a personal commitment to Christ, interpreting it as symbolic rather than a means of grace.

- **Infant vs. Believer's Baptism**: This crucial division among denominations influences varied practices. Paedo-baptists, such as Presbyterians, view baptism as a sign of inclusion in the covenant community, akin to the Old Testament practice of circumcision. Conversely, believer's baptists argue that baptism should follow an individual’s conscious decision to follow Christ, which emphasizes personal faith.

The theological understanding of baptism remains a source of rich discussion within Christianity, reflecting broader views on salvation, grace, and community identity. Each tradition offers unique insights into the meaning and significance of this foundational Christian practice.
