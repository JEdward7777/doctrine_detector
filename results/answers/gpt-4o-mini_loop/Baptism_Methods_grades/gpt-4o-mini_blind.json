The student successfully presents the scriptural basis for each method and explains the theological significance attached to them in different denominational contexts. However, the response could have delved deeper into the doctrinal distinctions between the beliefs of these denominations regarding baptism, particularly highlighting the differences in understanding the sacramental nature of baptism across Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions. Additionally, a more in-depth exploration of the implications of infant baptism versus believer's baptism, especially in terms of covenant theology and soteriology, would have added further depth to the discussion. Overall, a solid answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
