  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation of the significance of baptism in the life of a Christian according to New Testament teachings. The student effectively articulates key aspects such as identification with Christ, public declaration of faith, cleansing of sin, incorporation into the Church, obedience to Christ's command, and symbol of new life. The references to relevant biblical passages support the statements made and demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic. Well done!"
