  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer on the significance of baptism in the Christian faith according to New Testament teachings. They accurately described various aspects of baptism, such as identification with Christ, public declaration of faith, cleansing of sin, incorporation into the Church, obedience to Christ's command, and symbol of new life. The student effectively supported their points with references from the New Testament. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer given by the teacher, focusing more on the core significance of baptism as cleansing from sin and unity with Christ."
