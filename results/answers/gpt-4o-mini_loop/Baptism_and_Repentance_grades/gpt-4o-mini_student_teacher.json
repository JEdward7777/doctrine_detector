  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student did an excellent job in explaining the relationship between repentance and baptism in the New Testament within Christian doctrine. They cited relevant verses, provided explanations, and connected the concepts well. However, the reference answer from the teacher is more succinct and directly addresses the concern with a straightforward statement. The student's answer delves deeper into the theological aspects and implications of repentance and baptism, which is commendable, but slightly deviates from the teacher's reference answer in terms of conciseness."
