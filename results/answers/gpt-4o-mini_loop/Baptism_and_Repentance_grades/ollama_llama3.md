## [Answer](../Baptism_and_Repentance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the New Testament, repentance and baptism are closely linked as essential components of the Christian faith and the process of salvation.

1. **The Call to Repentance**: Throughout the New Testament, both John the Baptist and Jesus emphasize the importance of repentance. For example, in Matthew 3:2, John the Baptist proclaims, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Jesus echoes this call in Mark 1:15, saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel." This highlights that repentance is foundational for entering into a relationship with God.

2. **Baptism as an Outward Expression**: Baptism serves as an outward demonstration of the inward change that occurs during repentance. In Acts 2:38, Peter urges the crowd to “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.” This shows that repentance must precede baptism, indicating that a personal decision to turn away from sin is essential before one can fully participate in the rite of baptism.

3. **Baptism as a Symbolic Act**: The act of baptism symbolizes the believer's identification with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection. Romans 6:3-4 states, "Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death? We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life." This signifies that baptism represents a new beginning that follows the act of repentance, marking the transition from the old life of sin to a new life in Christ.

4. **Repentance and Forgiveness**: The New Testament teaches that repentance is integral to receiving forgiveness of sins. In Luke 24:47, after His resurrection, Jesus instructs His disciples to proclaim repentance and forgiveness of sins in His name to all nations. In this context, baptism acts as a public declaration of one's repentance and acceptance of God's forgiveness, illustrating the believer's commitment to a transformed life.

5. **The Role of Faith**: The connection between faith, repentance, and baptism is evident in several passages, such as Acts 16:31, which states, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.” A person’s belief in Jesus often accompanies repentance and culminates in baptism as a sign of their faith and commitment to Him.

In summary, repentance is a necessary step toward salvation, while baptism follows as a public acknowledgment of that repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. Together, they represent interconnected aspects of the process of becoming a disciple and living a life devoted to Him.
