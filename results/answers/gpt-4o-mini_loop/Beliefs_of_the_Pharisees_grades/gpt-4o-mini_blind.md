## [Answer](../Beliefs_of_the_Pharisees.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Pharisees were a significant Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, and they held specific beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings that set them apart from other groups, such as the Sadducees.

1. **Life After Death**: The Pharisees believed in the resurrection of the dead, affirming that individuals would one day be resurrected to stand before God for judgment. This belief is rooted in various texts found in the Hebrew Scriptures, such as Daniel 12:2, and it laid a foundation for later Jewish and Christian thought on the afterlife.

2. **Spiritual Beings**: They acknowledged the existence of various spiritual beings, including angels, who serve God and interact with humanity. The Pharisees recognized a spiritual realm that encompasses both benevolent beings (like angels) and malevolent forces, confirming a belief in the active involvement of these beings in the world.

3. **Messianic Expectations**: The Pharisees held strong messianic beliefs, expecting a future Messiah who would restore Israel and establish God's kingdom on Earth. This expectation was intertwined with their eschatological views about the end times and the resurrection of the righteous, reflecting their hope in Godâ€™s ultimate plan for redemption.

The teachings of Jesus often engaged with Pharisaic beliefs, particularly regarding the resurrection, as seen in passages like Mark 12:18-27. Overall, the Pharisees played a crucial role in shaping the religious and doctrinal landscape of Judaism, and their beliefs significantly influenced early Christian theology, especially concerning resurrection and eternal life.
