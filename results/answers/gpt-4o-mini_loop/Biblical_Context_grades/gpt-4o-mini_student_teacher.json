  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer an 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive overview of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, including key passages and qualifications, they did not directly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community. The student focused more on the practical aspects of the deacons' responsibilities rather than specifically emphasizing the aspect of fair distribution of resources. Encouraging the student to tie in the concept of fair treatment and care more explicitly would enhance the alignment with the concern provided."
