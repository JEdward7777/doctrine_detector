## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
One of the most prominent biblical characters who exemplified humility is Moses. Throughout the narrative in the Book of Numbers, Moses is described as "very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth" (Numbers 12:3, ESV). Despite being chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and to receive the Law, Moses demonstrated profound humility in his relationship with God and his leadership.

A striking example of his humility can be found in Exodus 32 when the Israelites worshipped the golden calf. Upon learning of their sin, Moses interceded for them, pleading with God to forgive them rather than seeking his own glory or benefit. In a remarkable display of selflessness, he even offered to have his own name blotted out of God's book for the sake of the people (Exodus 32:32). This willingness to put others before himself reflects the deep humility that characterized Moses's life.

Moses’s journey illustrates the vital importance of humility, not only in leadership but also in remaining faithful to God’s calling. His example encourages us to seek a similar posture of humility, serving others and relying on God’s guidance in every aspect of our lives.
