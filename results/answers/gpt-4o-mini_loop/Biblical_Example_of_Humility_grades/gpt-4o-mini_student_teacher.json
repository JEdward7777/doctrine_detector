  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thorough explanation of how Moses exemplified humility in the Bible, citing specific examples from the text. The student effectively tied in the importance of humility in leadership and faithfulness to God's calling. However, the concern specified finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures, and the student's response focused solely on Moses rather than providing multiple examples or directly comparing them to the reference answer of David. Overall, a strong answer that could have been improved by incorporating more diverse Biblical examples of humility."
