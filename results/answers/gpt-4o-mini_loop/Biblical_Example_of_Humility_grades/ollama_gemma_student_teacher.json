The inclusion of specific examples from the scriptures, such as Moses's intercession for the Israelites and his willingness to have his name blotted out, showcases his profound humility and selflessness. The connection of Moses's humility to remaining faithful to God's calling is also insightful. Overall, this is a well-written and well-researched response that effectively addresses the concern regarding finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures."
