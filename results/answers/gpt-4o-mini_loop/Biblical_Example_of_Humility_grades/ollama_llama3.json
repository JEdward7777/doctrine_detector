  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively provides a tangible example of humility from Scripture, specifically highlighting Moses's humility in the face of God and his leadership of the Israelites. The writer also provides biblical support for their claims through specific references to Exodus and Numbers. This addresses the concern of finding examples of humility in the scriptures.\n\nThe response is well-organized and easy to follow, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. The writer's use of language is clear and concise, making it accessible to a general audience.\n\nHowever, while David is indeed an example of humility and righteousness, he is not the primary focus of this passage. Therefore, I deduct 10 points from the total score for not directly addressing the given answer or concern."
