By demonstrating how Moses actively prioritized the well-being of others over his own glory, the response effectively addresses the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. The analysis is well-supported with scriptural references and appropriately applies a Christian worldview in discussing the significance of humility in leadership and following God's calling."
