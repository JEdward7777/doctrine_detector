  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response exceeds expectations by providing a comprehensive treatment of the theme of Jesus' innocence in the New Testament. The examples provided are thorough, well-supported, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the relevant biblical texts. The writer effectively uses various passages to show that Jesus was recognized as innocent by different characters throughout his story, including Pilate, the thief on the cross, and even the religious leaders themselves.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have been organized more clearly. Some of the examples feel a bit disconnected from each other, and the writer could have done a better job of tying them together to create a cohesive narrative about Jesus' innocence.\n\nOverall, however, this is an outstanding response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the New Testament and its portrayal of Jesus' innocence. Well done!\n\nComment: This response is almost perfect. The only area for improvement is the organization, which could be tightened up a bit."
