  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive overview of key examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy. The student effectively references relevant passages and narratives to support their points. The inclusion of both Old Testament and New Testament examples demonstrates a well-rounded understanding of mercy throughout the biblical narrative. The use of parables, historical accounts, and poetic expressions of mercy enriches the breadth of the response. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a brief explanation of how these examples specifically connect to the concept of mercy, deepening the analysis further. Overall, a well-constructed and informative response."
