  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that effectively enhances the understanding of mercy through scriptural references and real-life applications. The examples chosen are relevant and reflect a strong understanding of the concept of mercy as portrayed in the Bible. The student effectively connects these examples to the broader theme of mercy in both divine and human relationships. However, the student could further improve the answer by including a wider range of scriptural references and real-life applications, as demonstrated in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, deeper theological reflections could be included to strengthen the Christian specific worldview aspect of the response."
