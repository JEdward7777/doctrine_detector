The inclusion of key passages, such as Exodus 34:6-7, the Prodigal Son, the Good Samaritan, David and Bathsheba, Jesus' interactions with sinners, the Thief on the Cross, and Psalm 103, enriches the discussion and demonstrates a deep understanding of mercy within a Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by utilizing a wide range of scriptural references to enhance the understanding of mercy, both in biblical contexts and real-life applications."
