  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that effectively illustrates the concept of transgression using key Biblical references. The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological implications of transgression within the Christian worldview and effectively connects these references to the broader themes of sin and redemption. However, the answer could have been improved by incorporating additional references that specifically align with the concern of learning from Biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
