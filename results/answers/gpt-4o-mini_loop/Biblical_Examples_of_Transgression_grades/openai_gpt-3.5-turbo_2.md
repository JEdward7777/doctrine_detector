## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Transgression.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Transgression in the Bible represents a violation of God's commandments or laws, and it carries deep theological implications within the framework of sin and redemption. Here are several key references that illustrate this concept:

1. **Exodus 20:1-17** - The Ten Commandments serve as the foundation of moral law, and any breach of these commands is regarded as a transgression against God's will, underscoring the seriousness of disobedience.

2. **Psalm 51:1-2** - King David's heartfelt plea for mercy in this penitential psalm reveals the weight of transgression. He asks God to wash away his transgressions, thereby acknowledging both his own sinfulness and God's forgiving nature.

3. **Isaiah 53:5** - This prophetic verse speaks of the suffering servant bearing our transgressions, illustrating the profound effects of sin and highlighting the necessity of redemption through Christ, who ultimately pays the price for humanity's transgressions.

4. **Romans 5:15-19** - The Apostle Paul elaborates on how sin entered the world through Adam's transgression and its disastrous impact on all humanity. This passage is pivotal in understanding the need for Christ as the remedy for the fallen state of mankind.

5. **1 John 3:4** - This verse directly correlates sin with lawlessness, confirming that to sin is to transgress God's law. It underlines the nature of sin as not just individual acts of wrongdoing but as a fundamental departure from God's intended order.

6. **James 2:9** - By stating that favoritism is a sin that convicts individuals as transgressors, James emphasizes that any breach of Godâ€™s commands, regardless of the magnitude, is significant. This highlights the reality of human sin and the universal need for grace.

7. **Galatians 3:19** - Paul explains that the law was instituted because of transgressions, pointing to its role in revealing human sinfulness and the subsequent need for the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Seed promised to redeem transgressors.

Collectively, these references not only provide a thorough theological understanding of transgression but also deepen our appreciation for the grace and redemption offered through Christ. In light of the seriousness of transgression, believers are called to recognize their need for God's forgiveness and to live in accordance with His laws out of love and gratitude for His grace.
