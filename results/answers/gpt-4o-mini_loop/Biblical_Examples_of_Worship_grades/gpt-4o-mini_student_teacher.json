  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thorough explanation of the example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship, using Exodus 20:3-5. The student effectively highlighted the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. However, there was some additional information and interpretation beyond the specific example requested, which could have been more concise and focused on the direct contrast between worship of God and idol worship as seen in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response with a clear connection to the Christian worldview."
