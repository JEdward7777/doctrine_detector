## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Jesus gave several important directives to his apostles regarding the good news, often referred to as the Gospel. One of the most notable directives can be found in the Great Commission, recorded in Matthew 28:18-20. In this passage, Jesus instructs his apostles to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he has commanded.

Additionally, in Mark 16:15, Jesus directs his apostles to "go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation." This emphasizes the command to spread the message of salvation and the Kingdom of God to all people.

Furthermore, in Acts 1:8, Jesus promises that the Holy Spirit will empower them to be his witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. This directive underlines their mission to share the good news globally, demonstrating the inclusive nature of the Gospel and the call to reach every corner of the earth with the message of hope found in Christ.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 85.

The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer, citing multiple passages from the Bible where Jesus gives directives to his apostles regarding spreading the good news. They accurately highlighted the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith by referencing the Great Commission, Mark 16:15, and Acts 1:8. However, the student's answer could have been improved by focusing more on the central message of the good news, which is salvation through faith in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin. This central message should have been emphasized more clearly in their response to align with the concern of recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith. Overall, it was a strong answer with room for slight improvement.
