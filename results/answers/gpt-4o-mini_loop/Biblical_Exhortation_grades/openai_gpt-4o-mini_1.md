## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Jesus gave several important directives to his apostles regarding the good news, often referred to as the Gospel. One of the most notable directives can be found in the Great Commission, recorded in Matthew 28:18-20. In this passage, Jesus instructs his apostles to go into all the world and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he has commanded.

Additionally, in Mark 16:15, Jesus directs his apostles to "go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation." This emphasizes the command to spread the message of salvation and the Kingdom of God to all people.

Furthermore, in Acts 1:8, Jesus promises that the Holy Spirit will empower them to be his witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth. This directive underlines their mission to share the good news globally, demonstrating the inclusive nature of the Gospel and the call to reach every corner of the earth with the message of hope found in Christ.
