## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The title "King of the Jews" ascribed to Jesus in the New Testament reflects multiple Old Testament prophecies regarding the anticipated messianic figure who would rule Israel. This title gains prominence in the context of Jesus' crucifixion, where it appears inscribed above His head (Matthew 27:37, Mark 15:26, Luke 23:38, John 19:19).

Several key Old Testament references illuminate the significance of this title:

1. **Davidic Covenant**: In 2 Samuel 7:12-16, God promises King David that his lineage will endure forever. This foundational expectation for a coming king establishes the belief that the Messiah would be a descendant of David, thereby fulfilling His role as king.

2. **Isaiah’s Prophecies**: Isaiah 9:6-7 foretells a child who will bear titles such as "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." His kingdom, described as everlasting, corresponds to the concept of a just and peaceful messianic king.

3. **Zechariah 9:9**: This prophecy depicts a king entering Jerusalem in humility, riding on a donkey. This imagery is beautifully fulfilled during Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem (Matthew 21:5), affirming His rightful status as king.

4. **Messianic Expectations**: The Old Testament is filled with texts pointing to the emergence of a ruler from Bethlehem (as in Jeremiah 23:5 and Micah 5:2), which serves to underscore Jesus' birth and lineage.

5. **Royal Titles**: The title “King” encapsulates Jewish understanding of authority and governance. Jesus’ ministry illustrates His identity as king in a way that transcends political power; His reign is spiritual and is made evident through His teachings about the Kingdom of God throughout the Gospels, particularly in Matthew.

In conclusion, the references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" not only fulfill specific Old Testament prophecies but also articulate His role as the ultimate Messiah who establishes a profound spiritual kingdom. Understanding this concept is vital for grasping the nature of Jesus' mission and kingship within Christian theology.
