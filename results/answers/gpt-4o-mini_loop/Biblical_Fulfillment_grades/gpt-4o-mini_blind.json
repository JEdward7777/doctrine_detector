It effectively ties in key Old Testament references, such as the Davidic Covenant, Isaiah's prophecies, Zechariah 9:9, Messianic expectations, and the significance of royal titles. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications of Jesus' role as the ultimate Messiah and King within Christian doctrine. Great job overall!"
