  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of God's majesty and provides insightful interpretations of several relevant Bible verses. The selection of passages showcases the diverse expressions of God's majesty in both poetic and prophetic contexts. The connection between acknowledging God's majesty and experiencing deeper worship is also well-articulated.\n\nHowever, the response would benefit from including additional verses from the reference answer provided by the teacher. Including these additional references would strengthen the student's overall argument and provide a more comprehensive overview of the topic."
