4. **Isaiah 6:1**: "In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple."  
   - Isaiah’s vision reveals God’s exalted position, reminding believers of His sanctity and power, which invites us to approach Him with humility and reverence.
