## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The title "Son of Man" as it applies to the coming Messiah is rooted in several Old Testament passages that contribute to its understanding in a messianic context. Here are some key references:

1. **Daniel 7:13-14**: This passage is perhaps the most significant association with the title "Son of Man." In his vision, Daniel sees "one like a son of man" coming with the clouds of heaven and approaching the Ancient of Days. This figure is granted authority, glory, and an everlasting kingdom, which aligns with messianic expectations of a coming ruler.

2. **Psalm 8:4-6**: This psalm reflects on the nature of humanity and the role of "man" (or "son of man") in relation to creation. While it speaks generally about humanity, it lays a foundation for understanding the significant role that the Messiah, as the true representative of humanity, will undertake in God's kingdom.

3. **Ezekiel**: Throughout the book of Ezekiel, the prophet refers to himself as "son of man" (e.g., Ezekiel 2:1). This title emphasizes humanity and foreshadows the role of the Messiah as both fully human and fully divine. It symbolizes the obedient and faithful servant of God that the Messiah will embody.

4. **Isaiah 53**: While this passage does not specifically use the term "Son of Man," it describes the suffering servant who bears the sins of many. This portrayal connects to the type of Messiah expected by the Jewish people, one who suffers and redeems, which resonates with the compassionate and sacrificial aspect of the "Son of Man."

5. **Genesis 3:15**: Known as the protoevangelium or the first announcement of the Gospel, this passage hints at a coming figure who will crush the serpent's head. The term “seed of the woman” is often linked to the humanity of the Messiah, which draws a connection to the idea of the "Son of Man."

Together, these texts contribute to the rich tapestry of messianic expectations in the Old Testament, framing the eventual revelation of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of the "Son of Man" title in the New Testament, particularly in the gospels where Jesus frequently uses this title for Himself.
