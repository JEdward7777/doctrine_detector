  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the Old Testament references contributing to the understanding of the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah. The inclusion of key passages such as Daniel 7, Psalm 8, Ezekiel, Isaiah 53, and Genesis 3 displays a comprehensive approach to the topic. The student effectively connects these passages to the messianic expectations and the eventual revelation of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the specific contextual nuances of each passage and elaborating on how they collectively point to the unique identity and mission of the Messiah as the \"Son of Man.\" Overall, a well-researched and articulate answer."
