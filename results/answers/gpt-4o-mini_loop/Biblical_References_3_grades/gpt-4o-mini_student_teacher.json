  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer with a score of 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and well-structured response that addresses the question effectively. They referenced key Old Testament passages such as Daniel 7, Psalm 8, Ezekiel, Isaiah 53, and Genesis 3, which all contribute to the understanding of the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah. Additionally, the student connected these passages to the messianic expectations and the fulfillment in Jesus Christ in the New Testament.\n\nWhile the student's answer went above and beyond in providing a detailed explanation with multiple references, there was still room for improvement in terms of focusing more squarely on the specific concern provided by the teacher. The student could have linked their detailed analysis of the Old Testament passages more explicitly to how it informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' Despite this minor deviation, the student demonstrated a deep understanding of the topic and effectively supported their arguments with relevant biblical references."
