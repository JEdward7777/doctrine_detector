Connecting these Old Testament passages to the fulfillment in Jesus Christ in the New Testament, particularly in the gospels, demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic. The inclusion of both prophetic and redemptive aspects further enriches the analysis. Great job in addressing the concern and connecting the dots between the Old and New Testament teachings."
