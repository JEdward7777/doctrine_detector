It effectively addressed the concern by exploring how these Old Testament passages inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' identity as the 'Son of Man.' The response could have further emphasized the redemption and sacrificial aspect of the Messiah in the Old Testament prophecies, but overall, it demonstrated a solid grasp of the theological significance of the title in both biblical contexts."
