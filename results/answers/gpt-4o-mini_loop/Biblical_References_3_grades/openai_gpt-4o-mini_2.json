It effectively incorporates relevant passages and explanations to demonstrate the significance and continuity of this title in prophetic identity and fulfillment. The response could be strengthened by further expanding on the specific connections between the Old Testament references and Jesus' actions and teachings as recorded in the New Testament gospels."
