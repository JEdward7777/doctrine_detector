The examples provided from Exodus, Psalm, Isaiah, Matthew, and Philippians offer a comprehensive understanding of how the term is used throughout Scripture.\n\nThe theological insights offered provide a rich understanding of the implications of Christ's lordship, affirming His identity as the Son of God and His central role in the divine economy of salvation. The response effectively demonstrates the importance of recognizing biblical references to reinforce our understanding of God's authority and the significance of acknowledging Him as Lord.\n\nThe only deduction is for not including Psalms 86:15-17, which was mentioned in the original answer. However, the response provides a comprehensive examination of the term \"Lord\" and its significance in biblical texts, making it an excellent response that effectively addresses the concern."
