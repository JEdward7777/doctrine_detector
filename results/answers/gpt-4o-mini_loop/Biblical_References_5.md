## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The concept of unleavened bread is intricately linked to the New Testament, particularly through the accounts of the Last Supper and the significance of Communion in Christian teachings. A foundational scripture is **1 Corinthians 11:23-26**, where the Apostle Paul recounts the Last Supper and highlights that the bread symbolizes the body of Christ. The unleavened nature of this bread signifies purity and embodies Jesusâ€™ sinlessness.

Additionally, the Gospels of **Matthew 26:17-29**, **Mark 14:12-25**, and **Luke 22:7-20** narrate how Jesus shared unleavened bread with His disciples during Passover, instituting Communion as a remembrance of His sacrificial death.

Furthermore, in **1 Corinthians 5:6-8**, Paul discusses the symbolism of leaven and urges believers to "cleanse out the old leaven" so they may become a "new lump." This metaphor reinforces the notion of addressing sin and living a pure life in Christ, echoing the practice of removing leavened bread during Passover.

These passages collectively underline the theological significance of unleavened bread within the framework of Christian belief, specifically in relation to the sacrifice of Jesus and the call for holiness among believers.
