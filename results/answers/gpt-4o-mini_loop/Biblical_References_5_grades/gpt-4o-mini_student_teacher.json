  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer that effectively connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings through multiple New Testament scriptures. The inclusion of 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, as well as passages from Matthew, Mark, and Luke, demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. However, there was some additional information included that expanded beyond the specific focus on unleavened bread, which slightly detracted from the clarity and conciseness of the response. Overall, a solid attempt with room for slight improvement in staying directly focused on the question at hand."
