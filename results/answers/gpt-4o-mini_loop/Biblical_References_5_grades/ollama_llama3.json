It correctly identifies 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 as discussing the removal of sin from the church and its connection to purity and holiness. Additionally, it mentions other relevant passages such as 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 and the Gospels' accounts of the Last Supper.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by providing more depth and analysis on how these biblical texts relate to Christian practices, particularly in terms of unleavened bread's significance. For example, it would have been helpful to explore further the symbolism of leaven and its connection to sin, or to discuss how the practice of removing leavened bread during Passover relates to the call for holiness among believers.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of biblical texts but could benefit from more in-depth analysis and application."
