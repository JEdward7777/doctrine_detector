  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained list of key Bible verses related to the concept of resurrection, including verses that highlight the promise of resurrection, the significance of Christ's resurrection, and the hope of eternal life for believers. The answer effectively demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic by grounding beliefs and teachings in authoritative Christian texts. The student could have enhanced the answer by including additional verses, but overall, it aligns well with the concern of focusing on scripture to support Christian beliefs."
