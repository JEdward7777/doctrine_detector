Additionally, the writer provides thoughtful analysis and connections between these verses, demonstrating their ability to apply biblical principles to larger theological themes.\n\nWhile the response could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern about focusing on scripture, it is clear that the writer has prioritized this approach in their analysis. The inclusion of seven specific Bible verses, along with brief summaries and explanations, shows a strong commitment to grounding beliefs and teachings in authoritative Christian texts.\n\nOverall, this response is well-organized, biblically grounded, and demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with key passages related to resurrection and eternal life."
