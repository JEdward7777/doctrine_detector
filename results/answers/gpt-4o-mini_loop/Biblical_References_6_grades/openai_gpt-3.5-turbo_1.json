  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides an excellent elaboration on the concept of resurrection in the Bible, using specific verses to support the discussion. By grounding the explanation in authoritative Christian texts, the response effectively upholds the importance of scripture in shaping beliefs and teachings. The only drawback is the absence of direct references to 1 Peter 3:21 and Luke 20:27 in the explanation, which could have further enriched the discussion. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian concept of resurrection."
