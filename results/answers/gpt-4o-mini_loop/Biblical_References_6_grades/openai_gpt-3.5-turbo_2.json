  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of key Bible verses related to the concept of resurrection, highlighting the significance of Christ's resurrection and the hope of eternal life for believers. By grounding the discussion in authoritative Christian texts, the writer effectively demonstrates the importance of scriptural support in understanding and teaching Christian beliefs. The response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern and explicitly connecting the verses cited in the original answer to the broader theme of resurrection in the Bible."
