  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of the Sabbath in the Bible. They provide relevant and well-chosen scripture references to support their claims, and their explanation of the Sabbath as a day of rest, worship, and reflection is accurate and insightful. However, including the suggested references from the teacher would further strengthen the response."
