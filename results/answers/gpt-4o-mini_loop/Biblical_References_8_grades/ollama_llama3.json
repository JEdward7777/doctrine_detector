  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption, particularly in its exploration of the concept of ransom. The writer provides six key verses that illustrate the idea of Jesus as a ransom, and they offer thoughtful explanations of each passage's contribution to our understanding of redemption. The response also effectively emphasizes the sacrificial nature of Jesus' mission and the costliness of sin.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the writer does not explicitly address the concern specified in the prompt. While the response does explore the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption, it could be more directly focused on this concern. Additionally, some of the explanations could be further developed or supported with additional biblical evidence.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of ransom and its role in Christian theology. With some refinement to address the specified concern and provide more detailed explanations, it could be even stronger."
