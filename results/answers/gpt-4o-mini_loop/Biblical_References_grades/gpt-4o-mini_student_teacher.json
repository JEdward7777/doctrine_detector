  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided an excellent and thorough response connecting various Bible verses to the concept of covenant faithfulness. They effectively explained how each verse reflects God's faithfulness and the expectation of faithfulness from His people. However, they missed including the specific references given by the teacher (Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18), which were crucial for addressing the concern directly. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and provided insightful explanations supported by relevant scriptural examples."
