Acts 9:13-16 recounts the pivotal moment of Saul's calling, revealing God's plan for him to be a chosen instrument for spreading the Gospel to the Gentiles. In this passage, God commands Ananias to go to Saul, despite Ananias's fear given Saul's history of persecuting Christians. God reassures Ananias that Saul is to proclaim the name of Jesus not only to the Gentiles but also to kings and the people of Israel. This clearly illustrates that the message of Jesus is intended to transcend ethnic and cultural boundaries, emphasizing that Gentiles are integral to God’s redemptive plan.

Galatians 2:16 further underscores the theological basis for the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. The verse asserts that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. This is a foundational principle that both Jews and Gentiles are justified by faith, asserting that the law does not limit access to salvation. Paul’s argument here highlights the universal nature of the Gospel — salvation is available to all who believe in Christ, regardless of their background.

In summary, these passages affirm the inclusive character of the Christian faith. They establish that the Gospel message is for both Jews and Gentiles, and that salvation is attained through faith in Jesus Christ rather than through adherence to the law. This reflects the core Christian belief in the universality and accessibility of the Gospel, emphasizing that all are welcomed into God's family through faith.
