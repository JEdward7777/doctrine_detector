The selected verses effectively highlight the nature, significance, and eternal aspects of heaven for believers. However, the student could have further enriched their analysis by incorporating additional Old Testament references such as 1 Kings 8:22-24 and Genesis 1:1 to provide a more holistic perspective on the concept of heaven."
