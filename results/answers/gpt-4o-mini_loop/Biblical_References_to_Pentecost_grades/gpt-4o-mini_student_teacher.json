  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the Festival of Weeks and its significance in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, particularly emphasizing the spiritual implications for Christians. The student accurately references key passages from Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Acts that demonstrate the observance and significance of Pentecost. However, the student missed references from Numbers and 2 Chronicles as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. It is important to include all the relevant biblical references to provide a complete understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost from a Christian worldview."
