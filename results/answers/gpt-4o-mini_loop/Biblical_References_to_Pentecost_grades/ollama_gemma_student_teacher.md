2. **Leviticus**:
   - **Leviticus 23:15-22**: This passage provides detailed instructions about the Festival of Weeks, including the counting of the omer and the required offerings. It underscores the importance of presenting the first fruits as an act of worship and gratitude.

3. **Deuteronomy**:
   - **Deuteronomy 16:9-12**: Here, the Festival of Weeks is described in conjunction with remembrance of the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, emphasizing the link between the harvest and God's faithfulness.
