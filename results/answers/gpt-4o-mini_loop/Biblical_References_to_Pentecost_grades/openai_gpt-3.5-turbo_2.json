  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed and accurate overview of the scriptural references to the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost), highlighting key passages from Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Acts that emphasize both the agricultural and spiritual significance of the festival. The explanation effectively connects the Old Testament roots of the festival with its fulfillment in the New Testament through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost from a Christian worldview."
