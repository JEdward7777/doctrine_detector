## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The concept of Jesus as the cornerstone is referenced in several key passages throughout the Bible, which highlight His foundational role in the faith and the importance of His redemptive work. Here are some significant verses:

1. **Matthew 21:42**: Jesus addressed the religious leaders, saying, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?" This verse reveals Jesus as the foundational stone of God's Kingdom, signifying that despite rejection by the religious authorities, He was divinely chosen for His crucial role in God's plan.

2. **Acts 4:11**: Peter boldly declares, "Jesus is 'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.'" This affirmation highlights that Jesus, although initially rejected, occupies a position of supreme significance for faith and salvation, underscoring His importance in the believer's life.

3. **Ephesians 2:19-20**: In this letter, Paul explains, "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God’s people and also members of His household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the chief cornerstone." This passage elucidates how Jesus serves as the essential foundation of the church, centralizing His authority and fostering unity among believers in Him.

4. **1 Peter 2:6-7**: Peter writes, "For in Scripture it says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in Him will never be put to shame.' Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, 'The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.'" These profound words depict Jesus as chosen and precious, highlighting that faith in Him is vital for salvation and the honor that comes with it.

These verses collectively convey that Jesus is central to the Christian faith—He serves not only as the foundation upon which the church is built but also embodies God’s intentional plan for redemption and relationship with humanity. The imagery of the cornerstone suggests stability, strength, and essential support for both the believer’s spiritual life and the church as a whole.
