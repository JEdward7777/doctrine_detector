  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer is well-written and comprehensively analyzes various biblical passages to support the claim that God is the \"Most High.\" The selection of verses is appropriate and the interpretations are insightful. The conclusion effectively summarizes the attributes of God revealed by the title \"Most High.\"\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from including additional verses that explicitly express the sovereignty of God, such as Psalm 83:18 and Daniel 4:17, which are referenced in the teacher's answer. Including these passages would strengthen the student's argument and provide a more comprehensive analysis."
