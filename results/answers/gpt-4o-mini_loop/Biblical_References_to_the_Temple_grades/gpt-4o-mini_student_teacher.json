  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of key scriptures that specifically reference the temple as the \"house of Yahweh.\" While their list goes beyond the teacher's reference answer and includes relevant passages, the reference answer provides a more direct and concise response to the question. The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept but could have been improved by focusing on the most specific scriptures mentioned by the teacher."
