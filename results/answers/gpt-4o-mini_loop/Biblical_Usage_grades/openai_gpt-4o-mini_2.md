## [Answer](../Biblical_Usage.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The term "begat" is prominently used in the genealogy accounts of the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament and the New Testament, to denote a familial relationship, specifically a fatherâ€™s direct connection to his son. It signifies the act of fathering a child and establishes a line of descent.

For instance, in Genesis, "begat" is frequently employed to trace the lineage from Adam to Noah and then to Abraham, highlighting the succession of generations. A notable example is found in Genesis 5: "Adam begat Seth," indicating that Seth is the son of Adam.

In the New Testament, the genealogies in the Gospels of Matthew (Matthew 1:1-16) and Luke (Luke 3:23-38) also utilize the term. Matthew emphasizes Joseph's lineage to establish Jesus' legal right to the throne of David, while Luke traces Jesus' lineage back to Adam, reflecting a universal connection to all humanity.

The term "begat" can encompass broader meanings, sometimes indicating a more general ancestry ("is the ancestor of") rather than strictly biological parenthood. This is evident in genealogies where the line includes generations that are not exclusively father-son relationships.

Overall, "begat" forms a narrative that connects individuals across generations, fulfilling theological themes such as covenant, promise, and the fulfillment of lineage related to the Messiah, Jesus Christ. This understanding deepens our appreciation of how God orchestrated His divine plan through history, demonstrating His faithfulness in fulfilling promises to His people.
