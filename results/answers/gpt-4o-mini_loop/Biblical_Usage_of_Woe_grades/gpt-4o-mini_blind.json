The analysis delves into the context of each passage, highlighting the consequences of sin and emphasizing the need for repentance and redemption through Christ. The student effectively illustrates how the concept of \"woe\" reveals God's disapproval of sin and His ultimate authority and justice. The only minor improvement could be more explicit integration of the concept of God's holiness and righteousness in relation to His judgment."
