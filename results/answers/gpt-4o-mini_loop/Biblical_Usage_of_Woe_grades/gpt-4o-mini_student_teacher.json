  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer showcasing different examples of the term \"woe\" in the Bible and its connection to God's judgment. They effectively analyzed each passage, linking it to the consequences of sin and divine judgment. However, the student could have included additional examples from the reference answer provided by the teacher to enhance the depth of their response. Overall, this is a strong answer but could benefit from a slightly wider range of scriptural examples."
