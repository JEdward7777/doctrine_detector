In biblical times, altars played a crucial role in worship and were constructed using a variety of materials, reflecting their significance in sacred rituals. Common materials included:

1. **Stones**: Altars were often made from uncut or unhewn stones, as exemplified in Exodus 20:25. Here, the Lord commands that tools should not be used on the stones, emphasizing their natural state and the holiness associated with the altar.

2. **Earth**: Simple earthen altars were also prevalent, particularly during earlier times or among nomadic peoples. Exodus 20:24 mentions building altars of earth, highlighting a humble approach to worship.

3. **Wood**: Wooden altars were used, especially in personal or temporary contexts. For instance, in 1 Kings 18:31, the prophet Elijah rebuilds an altar of wood on Mount Carmel to call upon the Lord.

4. **Metal**: As the practice of worship evolved, particularly in the construction of the Temple in Jerusalem, metals such as bronze and gold were incorporated. 1 Kings 6:20-22 describes the intricate use of gold and bronze in the construction of the Temple's altar, illustrating the grandeur of worship in later periods.

These materials not only served practical purposes but also carried deep theological meanings. The choice of uncut stones and earthy materials reflected purity and a direct connection to God, while the use of elaborate metals signified a response to His majesty and holiness. Each altar, regardless of its construction, was central to the peopleâ€™s relationship with God, serving as a sacred space for sacrifice and communion.
