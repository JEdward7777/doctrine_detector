The inclusion of the theological meanings behind the choice of materials enhances the understanding of the significance of altars in worship. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how knowing about altar materials can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship. A strong connection is made between the physical construction of altars and their spiritual symbolism. Great job!"
