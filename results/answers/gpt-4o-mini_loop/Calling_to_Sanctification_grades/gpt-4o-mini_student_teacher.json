  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer by referencing relevant biblical passages that emphasize the importance of personal sanctification. They effectively demonstrated an understanding of the command given to believers regarding their sanctification. However, the teacher's reference answer was more concise and directly stated the command without the need for additional explanations from various biblical passages. Overall, the student's answer aligns well with the Christian worldview in emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process."
