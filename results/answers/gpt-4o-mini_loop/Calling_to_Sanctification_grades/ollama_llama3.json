  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides some relevant biblical passages that support the idea of believers being called to personal sanctification, which aligns with the given answer. However, it could be improved in several ways:\n\n* The response could provide more depth and explanation regarding the concept of sanctification and its significance in the life of a believer.\n* The connection between the biblical passages cited and the concern of emphasizing personal responsibility could be made more explicit.\n* The response could also benefit from providing examples or illustrations of how believers can practically live set apart lives that reflect God's holiness.\n\nOverall, the response provides some good foundation for understanding the importance of sanctification, but it could be strengthened with more development and application."
