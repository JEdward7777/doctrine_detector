## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Believers are commanded to pursue personal sanctification as a fundamental aspect of their faith, as highlighted in several passages throughout the New Testament. A prominent verse is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3, which states, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality."

Additionally, Hebrews 12:14 exhorts believers to "Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord." This underscores the importance of holiness in the life of a believer.

Furthermore, in 1 Peter 1:15-16, believers are encouraged to be "holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" This call to holiness is a reflection of God's own character and a directive for how believers are to live.

Together, these passages reveal that sanctification is both a process and a command for believers, urging them to live set apart lives that reflect God's holiness and align with His will.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response provides some relevant biblical passages that support the idea of believers being called to personal sanctification, which aligns with the given answer. However, it could be improved in several ways:

* The response could provide more depth and explanation regarding the concept of sanctification and its significance in the life of a believer.
* The connection between the biblical passages cited and the concern of emphasizing personal responsibility could be made more explicit.
* The response could also benefit from providing examples or illustrations of how believers can practically live set apart lives that reflect God's holiness.

Overall, the response provides some good foundation for understanding the importance of sanctification, but it could be strengthened with more development and application.
