It aligns well with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the individual's responsibility in the sanctification process by highlighting the command for believers to be holy in all aspects of their lives. The scriptural references provided reinforce the importance of personal responsibility in sanctification according to Christian beliefs. Great job!"
