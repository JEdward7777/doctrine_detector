## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Believers are commanded to pursue personal sanctification as a fundamental aspect of their faith, as highlighted in several passages throughout the New Testament. A prominent verse is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3, which states, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality."

Additionally, Hebrews 12:14 exhorts believers to "Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord." This underscores the importance of holiness in the life of a believer.

Furthermore, in 1 Peter 1:15-16, believers are encouraged to be "holy in all your conduct, since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'" This call to holiness is a reflection of God's own character and a directive for how believers are to live.

Together, these passages reveal that sanctification is both a process and a command for believers, urging them to live set apart lives that reflect God's holiness and align with His will.
