It effectively highlights God's initiative in including all people, the Gentile Centurion's willingness to seek God, Peter's transformation in understanding God's inclusivity, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Gentiles, and the importance of baptism and inclusion in the early Church. The doctrinal correctness is strong, but could be further enhanced by delving deeper into theological implications of Gentile inclusion in God's redemptive plan."
