  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and detailed answer that effectively connects the centurion's visit to Peter with the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community. The response effectively highlights key points such as God's divine initiative, the inclusion of Gentiles like Cornelius, Peter's transformation, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and the theme of baptism and inclusion in the early Church. The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the inclusivity of the Gospel and the mission of the Church to reach all nations. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly linking these points to the concern of the mission of the Church to reach all nations and the inclusivity of the Gospel in a more explicit manner."
