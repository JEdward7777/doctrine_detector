  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 90\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of the centurion's visit to Peter in the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community. The essay clearly articulates the divine initiative, the openness of the Gospel to Gentiles, Peter's transformation, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and the importance of inclusion in the early Church. The writing is well-organized, articulate, and supported by relevant textual references from Acts."
