The explanation effectively demonstrates the mission of the Church to reach all nations and exemplifies the inclusivity of the Gospel message. The theological insights presented align well with Christian teachings and the concern provided. Great job in connecting the narrative to the overarching mission of the Church and the universal nature of the Gospel."
