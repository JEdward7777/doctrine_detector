  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with detailed explanations of various qualities that define an upright person in the biblical context. They effectively referenced specific bible verses to support their points and tied them back to the concept of living according to God's will. While the answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, the student could further emphasize the importance of obedience to God's laws and moral purity as central qualities of an upright person."
