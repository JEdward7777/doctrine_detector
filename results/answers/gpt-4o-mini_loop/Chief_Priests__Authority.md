## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the context of ancient Israelite worship, particularly during the time of the Second Temple, there was a distinct hierarchical relationship between the chief priests and the ordinary priests.

The chief priests, often from the high priestly family, held significant authority in religious matters. The high priest was the chief official responsible for the rituals and sacrifices in the Temple, presiding over the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council. The term "chief priests" encompasses not only the high priest but also other leading priests with substantial roles in the religious leadership and administration of the Temple.

Ordinary priests, known as "kohanim," were descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses. Their responsibilities included performing sacrificial rites, maintaining the Temple, and assisting with the rituals prescribed in the Torah. While they were granted a privileged status as mediators between the people and God, their authority was subordinate to that of the chief priests.

The authority structure within the priesthood carries profound spiritual significance in the Jewish religious framework. The chief priests were seen as the spiritual leaders who guided the community in matters of worship and adherence to God's commandments. This leadership underscored the importance of maintaining purity and devotion in the worship practices of Israel.

In summary, the chief priests held a higher authority over the ordinary priests, directing the religious practices, making crucial decisions regarding Temple operations, and representing the priesthood in matters of governance. The ordinary priests executed the day-to-day duties of Temple worship under the guidance and authority of the chief priests, all of which contributed to the fulfillment of God's covenant with His people.
