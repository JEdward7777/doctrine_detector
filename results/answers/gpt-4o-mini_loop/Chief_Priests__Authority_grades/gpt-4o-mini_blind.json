The student clearly articulates the authority structure within the priesthood and how the chief priests held higher authority over the ordinary priests, supported by relevant details and explanations. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the hierarchical dynamics within the priesthood during the time of the Second Temple. Great job!"
