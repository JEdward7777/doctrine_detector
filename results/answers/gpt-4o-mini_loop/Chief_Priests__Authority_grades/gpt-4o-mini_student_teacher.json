  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the hierarchical relationship between the chief priests and the ordinary priests in ancient Israel, demonstrating a good understanding of the authority structure within the priesthood. The response effectively discusses the roles and responsibilities of both the chief priests and ordinary priests. However, the student's answer could have been improved by more concisely stating the main point that the chief priests held higher rank and power than the ordinary priests, as indicated in the reference answer from the teacher. Nonetheless, the student's answer is well-supported and showcases a solid grasp of the topic."
