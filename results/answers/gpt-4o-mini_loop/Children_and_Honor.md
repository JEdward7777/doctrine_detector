## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Bible instructs children to honor their parents in several key passages. One of the most well-known verses is found in the Ten Commandments, specifically in Exodus 20:12, which states, "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you." This command emphasizes the significance that God places on the parent-child relationship and highlights the importance of respect and obedience within the family structure.

Additionally, in Ephesians 6:1-3, the Apostle Paul reiterates this command, saying, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—which is the first commandment with a promise—'so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.'" This passage reinforces both the obligation to obey parents and the blessings associated with honoring them.

Colossians 3:20 also echoes this teaching, stating, "Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord." This underscores that honoring parents transcends mere social or familial expectations; it is also a matter of spiritual significance.

Overall, the biblical instruction regarding how children should honor their parents encompasses obedience, respect, and an acknowledgment of their authority. This not only reflects a commitment to family but also a deeper commitment to obedience to God, recognizing the essential role that parents play in shaping their children’s lives.
