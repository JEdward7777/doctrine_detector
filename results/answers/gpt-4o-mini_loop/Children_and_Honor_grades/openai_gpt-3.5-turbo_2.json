The inclusion of verses from Exodus, Ephesians, and Colossians adds depth and clarity to the argument, demonstrating a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on honoring parents. The response effectively addresses the concern by delving into the specific biblical expectations and providing a well-supported explanation. Great job!"
