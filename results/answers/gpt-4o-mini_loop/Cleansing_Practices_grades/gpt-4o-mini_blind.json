  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: This response demonstrates a deep understanding of the shift in emphasis from Old Testament ritual cleanliness to New Testament spiritual purity through Christ. The student effectively identifies and explains various modern practices that reflect the principles of holiness, purity, and devotion without attempting to replicate Old Testament laws. The integration of relevant scriptures enhances the explanation and shows a solid foundation in Christian theology. Great job overall!"
