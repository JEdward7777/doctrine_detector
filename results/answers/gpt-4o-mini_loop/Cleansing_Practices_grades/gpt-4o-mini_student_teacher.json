  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response by offering various modern practices that align with the concept of ritual cleanliness from the Old Testament while integrating the significance of Christ's ultimate cleansing sacrifice in the New Testament. The answer effectively addresses the concern of enhancing spiritual growth and accountability by emphasizing both personal and communal aspects of faith practice. The student showcases a strong understanding of incorporating ancient teachings into contemporary Christian practices. The grade is slightly lower than perfect as the answer could have more directly aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
