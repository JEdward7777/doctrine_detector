It incorporates various aspects such as moral integrity, forgiveness, guidance of the Holy Spirit, accountability to God, self-reflection, repentance, transformation, and Christ-likeness, all of which align well with the concern that maintaining a clear conscience is vital for spiritual health and alignment with God's will. It effectively expands on the initial definition by emphasizing the multidimensional nature of a clear conscience within a Christian worldview."
