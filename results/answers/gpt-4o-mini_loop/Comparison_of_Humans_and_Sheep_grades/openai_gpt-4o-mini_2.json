  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the comparison between humans and sheep in the Bible, addressing key theological themes. It effectively explores human vulnerability, the need for divine guidance, God's role as the Shepherd, community and belonging within the Church, guidance from God's Word, and the call to follow Christ. The theological implications are well-supported and emphasize the importance of reliance on God. Great job in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview."
