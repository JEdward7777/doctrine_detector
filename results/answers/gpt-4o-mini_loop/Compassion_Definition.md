## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Compassion in the Bible is portrayed as a profound awareness of and empathy for the sufferings and misfortunes of others, paired with a heartfelt desire to alleviate that suffering. It reflects the very nature of God and is an essential aspect of Christian teachings.

1. **Biblical Definition**: The Hebrew term for compassion, "rachamim," relates to the concept of a womb, signifying deep, nurturing love and mercy. In the New Testament, the Greek word "σπλαγχνίζομαι" (splagchnizomai) encapsulates a similar depth of feeling, often seen in Jesus’s compassionate responses to human plight.

2. **Scriptural Examples**: The Bible offers numerous illustrations of compassion:
   - **God's Compassion**: Psalm 103:13 highlights this when it says, "As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him."
   - **Jesus’ Compassion**: The Gospels depict Jesus demonstrating compassion through acts like healing the sick (Matthew 14:14) and feeding the hungry (Matthew 15:32).
   - **The Good Samaritan**: In Luke 10:25-37, the Samaritan demonstrates compassion by helping the injured man, exemplifying the essence of loving one’s neighbor.

3. **Associated Actions**: Biblical compassion is closely tied to actionable responses:
   - **Helping the Needy**: Acts of kindness, providing for the poor, and visiting the sick reflect compassion (Matthew 25:35-40).
   - **Forgiveness and Understanding**: Believers are encouraged to show grace, as noted in Ephesians 4:32, which calls for kindness and compassion, urging forgiveness just as God has forgiven us.
   - **Empathy in Suffering**: Romans 12:15 teaches believers to rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep, emphasizing the importance of sharing in the emotional experiences of others.

In summary, compassion in the Bible embodies a heartfelt empathy that leads to tangible actions, reflecting God’s love and mercy. It calls believers to actively engage in the lives of others, especially those in need, demonstrating the transformative power of love in the Christian walk.
