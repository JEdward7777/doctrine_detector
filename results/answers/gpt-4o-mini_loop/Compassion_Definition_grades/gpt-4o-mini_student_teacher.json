  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough and well-supported explanation of the biblical perspective on compassion and how it guides actions towards others. They have effectively defined compassion using both Hebrew and Greek terms and supported their points with relevant scriptural examples. Additionally, they have accurately outlined associated actions tied to being compassionate, such as helping the needy, forgiveness, and empathy.\n\nThe student's response showcases a deep understanding of the biblical concept of compassion and effectively communicates how it should be lived out in practical ways. The only slight deduction in points could be due to the length of the response, which might have slightly exceeded the necessary details compared to the reference answer. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong grasp of the biblical perspective on compassion and its implications for Christian behavior."
