  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively integrates the teachings from Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 to address the concern regarding balancing divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment. The student demonstrates a sound understanding of how these verses emphasize the importance of mercy and redemption in the Christian worldview. The analysis is well-supported and aligns with a Christian perspective on punishment as a means for restoration rather than mere condemnation. However, a slightly deeper exploration into how divine justice and mercy work in tandem when addressing wrongdoing could have further enhanced the response. Overall, a strong interpretation with clear connections to the specified concern."
