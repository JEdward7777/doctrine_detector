  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-thought-out response on how Christians can handle temptation according to the Bible. The student has incorporated various biblical principles and actions that align with a Christian worldview. However, the answer could have been improved by emphasizing the importance of confessing personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. By focusing more on the integral aspect of acknowledging personal sin in light of God's forgiveness, the student could have achieved a higher grade."
