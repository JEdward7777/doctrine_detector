The use of relevant biblical references, clear explanations, and a Christian perspective is commendable. The emphasis on aligning one's conscience with God's will through Scripture and the guidance of the Holy Spirit is accurately presented. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound response. Great job!"
