Several individuals in the Bible are noted for being consecrated to God, which typically refers to being set apart for holy purposes or dedicated to God's service. Here are a few prominent examples:

1. **Samuel**: From birth, Samuel was dedicated to God by his mother Hannah and served in the temple (1 Samuel 1:24-28; 1 Samuel 2:18).

2. **Nazirite Vow**: Individuals who took a Nazirite vow, as described in Numbers 6, were consecrated to God for a specific period of time or for life. Notable Nazirites include:
   - **Samson**: Born to be a Nazirite, his strength was linked to his uncut hair (Judges 13-16).
   - **Samuel**: In addition to his early dedication, he also served as a Nazirite.

3. **Jeremiah**: God appointed and consecrated the prophet Jeremiah even before his birth, indicating the divine purpose for his life (Jeremiah 1:5).

4. **John the Baptist**: He was set apart for a specific mission to prepare the way for the Lord, and his lifestyle reflected a consecrated life (Luke 1:15).

5. **Jesus**: While fully divine, Jesus’ life on earth exemplified a deep commitment to God’s redemptive plan, demonstrating ultimate consecration (John 10:36).

6. **The Levites**: The entire tribe of Levi was set apart for service in the Tabernacle, dedicated to God’s work and worship (Numbers 3:6-10).

These examples illustrate various contexts and meanings of consecration throughout the Scriptures, emphasizing dedication to God's purposes and the transformative power of being set apart for Him.
