  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of consecration in a Christian context, covering the consecration of people, objects, and places. The student effectively incorporates scriptural references to support their points, demonstrating a solid understanding of the concept. One suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the role of the Holy Spirit in the process of consecration, as it is through the Spirit's work that believers are sanctified and empowered to live lives dedicated to God."
