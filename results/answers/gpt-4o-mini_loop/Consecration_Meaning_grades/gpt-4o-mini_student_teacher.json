  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that aligns well with the Christian understanding of consecration. They have demonstrated a clear understanding of the concept and its significance in serving God. The inclusion of scriptural references and examples further strengthens their response. However, the response could be improved by directly incorporating the reference answer provided by the teacher to demonstrate a clear alignment with the given definition. Overall, a well-written and well-supported explanation deserving of a high grade."
