The inclusion of specific verses, such as Isaiah 59:2 and Romans 1:18, effectively highlights the spiritual separation, divine judgment, and societal collapse resulting from evil actions. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how evil actions like killing, stealing, and slandering can lead to societal and personal turmoil, aligning well with Christian teachings on the impact of sin on relationships and communities."
