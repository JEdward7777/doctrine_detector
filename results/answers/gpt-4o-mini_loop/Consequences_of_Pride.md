## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Bible has much to say about the consequences of pride and the importance of humility.

1. **Consequences of Pride:**
   - Pride is portrayed negatively throughout Scripture. Proverbs 16:18 states, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." This verse underscores that pride can lead to one's downfall.
   - In James 4:6, it is emphasized that "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." Here, a proud heart is seen as being in opposition to God, while humility is regarded as a virtue that attracts His favor.
   - Proverbs 11:2 further states, "When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom," suggesting that pride leads to shame and a lack of wisdom.

2. **Importance of Humility:**
   - Humility is consistently celebrated throughout the Bible. Jesus exemplified humility, and in Philippians 2:3-4, Paul instructs believers, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves." This promotes a mindset of selflessness and regard for others.
   - Micah 6:8 succinctly expresses what the Lord requires of His people: "To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God." This verse reinforces the notion that humility is vital in oneâ€™s relationship with God.
   - In Luke 14:11, Jesus teaches that those who humble themselves will be exalted: "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted." This points to the divine principle that humility leads to honor.

Overall, the Bible teaches that pride results in destruction and disgrace, while humility is esteemed by God and is essential for a right relationship with Him and others. Embracing humility cultivates a spirit of love, servitude, and a deeper understanding of God's presence in our lives.
