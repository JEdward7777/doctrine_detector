The references to specific verses and explanations tie in effectively with the concern raised. The student effectively conveys the Christian worldview regarding the spiritual implications of pride and humility. Minor adjustments could include a direct reference to the contrast between God humbling the proud and lifting up the humble as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer for an even stronger connection. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
