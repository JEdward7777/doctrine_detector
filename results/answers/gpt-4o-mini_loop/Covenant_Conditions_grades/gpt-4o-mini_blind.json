  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible. They have correctly identified key covenants, provided scriptural references, and explained the conditions or lack thereof associated with each covenant. The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concepts surrounding covenants in the Christian worldview. Great job overall!"
