## Question [Covenant Conditions](../../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)
What are some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible?

An example of an unconditional covenant is God's promise to never destroy the earth again with a flood. In contrast, conditional covenants require obedience from the people, such as the covenant at Sinai where God said, 'If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant...'

## Stated Concern
Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

## [Answer](../Covenant_Conditions.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, covenants are significant agreements made between God and humans, which can be categorized into conditional and unconditional covenants.

### Conditional Covenants

1. **The Mosaic Covenant**: Established between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-24), this covenant required the Israelites to adhere to God's laws (the Ten Commandments and other regulations). The blessings associated with this covenant were contingent upon their obedience, as seen in Deuteronomy 28, where God outlines blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.

2. **The Davidic Covenant**: Although primarily an unconditional promise regarding David's lineage (2 Samuel 7:14-15), this covenant includes conditional elements tied to the faithfulness of David's descendants. God assures David that his throne will endure, but this is dependent on the fidelity of his heirs to God's commands.

3. **The Covenant with Noah (Post-Flood)**: While the promise that God would never again destroy the earth by flood is viewed as unconditional, the command for humanity to be fruitful and multiply (Genesis 9:1) suggests a conditional expectation regarding human behavior.

### Unconditional Covenants

1. **The Abrahamic Covenant**: Found in Genesis 12, 15, and 17, this covenant includes God's promise to Abraham to make him a great nation, bless him, and grant his descendants the land of Canaan. This covenant is unconditional, as it relies solely on God's faithfulness and is not based on any actions that Abraham must take.

2. **The New Covenant**: Instituted through Jesus Christ and referenced in Jeremiah 31:31-34 and fulfilled in the New Testament (particularly in Luke 22:20), this covenant is unconditional in its assurance of salvation and eternal life to all who place their faith in Christ. This salvation is entirely a work of grace, not contingent upon human merit.

3. **The Covenant with Noah (Rainbow Promise)**: After the Flood, God made a promise to Noah and all living creatures that He would never again destroy the earth with a flood, symbolized by the rainbow (Genesis 9:11-17). This is an unconditional promise that reveals God's mercy and faithfulness.

These covenants illustrate the diverse ways in which God engages with humanity, highlighting both His justice and mercy throughout biblical history.
