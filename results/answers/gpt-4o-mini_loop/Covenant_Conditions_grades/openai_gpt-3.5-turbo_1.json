The examples given are relevant and supported by scriptural references, showcasing a comprehensive grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the interconnectedness between God's justice and mercy in His covenantal relationships with humanity. Overall, this is an excellent response that effectively addresses the concern raised."
