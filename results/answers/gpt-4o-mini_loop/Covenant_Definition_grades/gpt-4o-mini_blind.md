## [Answer](../Covenant_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, a covenant is a solemn agreement or contract between two parties that establishes a relationship and outlines the terms and conditions of that relationship. It often includes promises, obligations, and signs to signify the commitment made. Biblically, covenants can be seen between God and individuals, groups, or humanity as a whole.

A few key features of Biblical covenants include:

1. **Divine Initiation**: Many covenants in the Bible are initiated by God, who sets the terms and establishes the relationship. For example, the covenant with Noah (Genesis 9:8-17), Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3; 15), and the Israelites through Moses (Exodus 19-24).

2. **Unconditional and Conditional Aspects**: Some covenants are unconditional, meaning God's promises do not depend on human actions (like the covenant with Noah), while others are conditional, requiring obedience and faithfulness from the people involved (like the Mosaic covenant).

3. **Signs**: Covenants often come with a sign that serves as a reminder of the covenant's promises. For example, the rainbow is a sign of God's covenant with Noah, and circumcision is a sign of God's covenant with Abraham.

4. **Covenant Community**: Many covenants establish a community or a chosen people, as seen with Israel as God's chosen nation.

5. **Fulfillment through Christ**: The New Covenant established by Jesus Christ, as outlined in the New Testament (particularly in Hebrews), fulfills and surpasses the previous covenants, offering a new means of relationship with God based on grace through faith.

In summary, a Biblical covenant is a formal agreement between God and His people that defines their relationship, includes promises and requirements, and is often marked by a physical sign. This understanding highlights the depth of God's commitment to His people and the relational nature of the agreements detailed throughout Scripture.
