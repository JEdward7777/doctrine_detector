  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. The student has demonstrated a deep understanding of the biblical covenants and effectively illustrated how they showcase God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture. The response comprehensively covers major covenants like the Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and the New Covenant and explains how each one highlights different aspects of God's faithfulness. The student effectively connects these covenants to the overarching narrative of redemption in the Bible.\n\nThe student could improve their answer by explicitly referencing the specific biblical covenants mentioned in the teacher's reference answer (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) to show direct alignment with the concern provided. This would strengthen the link between their answer and the given concern, further enhancing the cohesiveness of the response."
