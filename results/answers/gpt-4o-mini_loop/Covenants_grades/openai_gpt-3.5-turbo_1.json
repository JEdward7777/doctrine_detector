  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how biblical covenants illustrate God's unwavering commitment to His people, covering major covenants and their significance in God's redemptive plan. The analysis aligns well with the concern mentioned about recognizing the continuity of God's promises and the overarching narrative of redemption in the Bible. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention Isaac and Jacob in the response to fully align with the given answer."
