  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a comprehensive overview of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. The student effectively outlines key aspects such as purity laws, food restrictions, synagogue life, intermarriage, and Messianic expectations. The explanation of how these views influenced early Christian practices, including the inclusion of Gentiles, shifts in theological development, and ethical teachings, is well articulated. However, to enhance the response, the student could have integrated more specific biblical references to support their points, especially when discussing theological developments and ethical teachings within early Christianity. Incorporating direct scriptural support would have further strengthened the doctrinal foundation of the analysis."
