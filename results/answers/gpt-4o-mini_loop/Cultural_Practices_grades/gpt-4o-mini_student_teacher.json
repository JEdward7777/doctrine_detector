  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed response that thoroughly explores the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. The answer effectively addresses the concern of how cultural norms influence faith communities and practices from a Christian worldview. The student successfully integrated biblical references, such as Peter's vision in Acts 10 and key theological developments, to support their points. Additionally, the response demonstrates a deep understanding of how the early church navigated the challenges of inclusivity and the broader implications for Christian identity. Overall, this is a strong and well-articulated analysis."
