The theological insights presented are sound, drawing from relevant biblical passages to support the interpretation. The emphasis on self-denial, sacrificial commitment, daily devotion, and following in the footsteps of Jesus is doctrinally accurate and aligns well with Christian teachings on discipleship. Well done!"
