It effectively connects this promise to the Messianic Kingdom and the belief in Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of God's plan. The theological points mentioned are well-supported by biblical references and demonstrate a clear understanding of the importance of this promise for recognizing the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus."
