  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 85.\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the primary role of a deacon in the local church, highlighting the importance of service and support in various aspects of church life. The response was well-researched and referenced relevant biblical passages to support their points. While the student covered a broader range of duties beyond practical needs, they still emphasized the servanthood aspect of a deacon's role. Overall, a strong understanding of the biblical role of servanthood in the church was demonstrated."
