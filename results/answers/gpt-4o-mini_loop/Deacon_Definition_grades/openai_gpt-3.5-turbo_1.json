It effectively addresses the concern regarding understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church by highlighting the biblical basis and responsibilities of deacons in serving their fellow believers. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific scriptural references to reinforce the biblical foundation of the deacon's role even further."
