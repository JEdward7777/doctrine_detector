The detailed explanation of the responsibilities of deacons and their qualifications align well with the concern regarding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses and historical context further strengthens the response. The only minor improvement could be providing a direct connection between the specified answer and the broader understanding of deaconship within the Christian worldview."
