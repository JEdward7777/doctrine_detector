The inclusion of specific Bible verses such as Exodus 20:14, Matthew 5:27-28, Proverbs 6:32, and Hebrews 13:4 effectively supports the explanation. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the gravity of adultery as a sin that encompasses both actions and intentions. The only minor area for improvement would be to include a reference to the forgiveness and redemption available through Christ for those who repent of the sin of adultery."
