  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the biblical definition and implications of adultery according to Scripture. They referenced relevant verses and highlighted the seriousness of adultery as a breach of God's design for marriage. The response effectively integrated both Old and New Testament passages to support their points. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly stating the defined term as presented in the reference answer."
