## [Answer](../Definition_Clarity.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Christian context, the term 'adultery' is primarily defined as a violation of the marital covenant, specifically involving a married person engaging in sexual relations with someone who is not their spouse. This understanding is rooted in various passages of Scripture.

1. **Exodus 20:14**: One of the Ten Commandments clearly states, "You shall not commit adultery," highlighting the seriousness of this sin within God’s law.

2. **Matthew 5:27-28**: In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus expands the definition of adultery, indicating that even lustful thoughts towards someone who is not one’s spouse constitute adultery: "But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” This suggests that adultery is not just a physical act but also a matter of the heart and mind.

3. **Proverbs 6:32**: This verse emphasizes that "He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself," pointing to the moral decline and personal consequences associated with adultery.

4. **Hebrews 13:4**: The New Testament reinforces the seriousness of the act by stating, "Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous." 

In summary, in the Christian context, adultery is viewed as a serious sin that breaches God's design for marriage, with implications both spiritually and morally. It encompasses not just physical relations outside of marriage, but also the inner attitudes and intentions of the heart. This comprehensive view underscores the call for purity in both action and thought within the marital relationship.
