The term 'intercede' in Scripture conveys the significance of intervening or mediating on behalf of someone, especially in prayer. Here are some alternative translations and closely related concepts associated with 'intercede,' along with relevant biblical references to enhance understanding:

1. **Pray for** - This phrase is commonly found in translations like James 5:16, which instructs believers to pray for one another, encapsulating the essence of intercession.

2. **Entreat** - The act of earnestly requesting or pleading with God for someone else is reflected in verses like 1 Samuel 12:19, where the people ask Samuel to pray for them.

3. **Mediating** - While this term specifically applies to Christ (1 Timothy 2:5), it captures the broader role of intercession as seen in passages such as Hebrews 7:25, which describes Jesus as continually interceding for us.

4. **Advocate** - Found in 1 John 2:1, this term emphasizes Jesus' role in speaking on our behalf before the Father, reflecting the advocacy involved in intercessory prayer.

5. **Stand in the gap** - This phrase, derived from Ezekiel 22:30, illustrates the proactive stance of praying for others, engaging spiritually on their behalf.

6. **Plead** - This term highlights the urgency often associated with intercessory prayer, as seen in Psalm 106:23, where Moses pleads with God for the Israelites.

7. **Support** - Intercession can also imply providing spiritual backing, as indicated in Romans 15:30, where Paul asks for prayer support from the church in Rome.

These alternatives may vary depending on the specific biblical context and the original language nuances. Translators strive to convey the intent and meaning of intercessory prayer, ensuring theological integrity while honoring the multi-faceted nature of this profound act of faith.
