  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer, demonstrating a deep understanding of the concept of intercession in Scripture. They effectively presented alternative translations and related concepts with relevant biblical references to support their points. The inclusion of diverse examples and careful analysis of each alternative translation shows a thorough exploration of the topic. The only improvement could have been to include some of the more concise alternative translations provided in the reference answer to further enhance the depth of the response."
