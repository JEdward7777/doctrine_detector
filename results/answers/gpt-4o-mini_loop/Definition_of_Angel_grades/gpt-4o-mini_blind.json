  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the biblical definition of angels and their primary roles according to Christian doctrine. The answer effectively incorporates relevant biblical references to support each point made. However, there is room for improvement in ensuring clarity and precision in articulating theological concepts. The answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the divine nature of angels as created beings distinct from humans, and their continuous focus on carrying out God\u2019s will. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the concept of angels as part of the heavenly hierarchy under divine authority could enhance the depth of the response. Overall, a strong and well-supported answer."
