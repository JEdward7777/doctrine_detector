## [Answer](../Definition_of_Angel.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, angels are defined as spiritual beings created by God to serve as His messengers and servants. The word "angel" originates from the Greek term "angelos," meaning "messenger," while in the Hebrew Bible, the word is "malakh," which also conveys the message of being a messenger or envoy.

The primary roles of angels in the Scriptures include:

1. **Messengers**: Angels deliver important messages from God to humanity. A notable instance is when the angel Gabriel announced the miraculous birth of Jesus to Mary, as recorded in Luke 1:26-38. Gabriel also conveyed messages to Zechariah (Luke 1:11-20) and proclaimed the good news of Jesus' birth to the shepherds (Luke 2:9-14).

2. **Protectors and Guardians**: Angels are depicted as protective beings who watch over individuals and nations. For example, Psalm 91:11-12 states, "For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone." This shows God's promise of protection through His angels.

3. **Servants of God's Will**: Angels serve God's purposes and execute His commands. They play a role in executing divine judgment, as seen in Genesis 19:13 during the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and in Revelation 7:1, where angels are shown holding back the winds of judgment. Additionally, angels provide assistance during significant events, such as when an angel rescued Peter from prison in Acts 12:7-10.

4. **Worshippers**: Angels engage in worship and praise of God. In Isaiah 6:1-3, the seraphim are depicted praising God in His presence, exclaiming, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory." Similarly, in Revelation 4:8, four living creatures continuously worship God, emphasizing their role in glorifying Him.

5. **Spiritual Warfare**: Angels are involved in the spiritual battle against evil forces. Ephesians 6:12 states, "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms." This underscores the notion that angels play a role in the spiritual conflicts believers face.

In summary, the Bible presents angels as vital servants of God's will, facilitating communication between the divine and human realms and fulfilling roles that align with Godâ€™s purposes. Through their actions, they demonstrate God's care, protection, and sovereignty in both the spiritual and physical dimensions of life.
