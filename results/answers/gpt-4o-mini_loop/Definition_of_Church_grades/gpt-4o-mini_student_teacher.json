  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provides an in-depth understanding of the term 'church' in the New Testament, addressing local congregations, the universal church, the church as a spiritual entity, and the church's purpose, there is one significant concern with the student's answer. The student correctly acknowledges that the church is more than just a building, emphasizing its spiritual essence and community of believers. However, the answer could have emphasized this aspect even more prominently, ensuring a stronger alignment with the concern regarding the church's role beyond being a physical structure.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a solid grasp of the various dimensions of the term 'church' in the New Testament, providing thoughtful insights into its implications for believers."
