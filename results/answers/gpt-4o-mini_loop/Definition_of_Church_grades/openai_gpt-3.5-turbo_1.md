In the New Testament, the term 'church' (from the Greek word "ekklesia") primarily refers to the body of believers who are called out to follow Jesus Christ. The term can encompass several important meanings:

1. **Local Congregations**: It often refers to specific gatherings of Christians in a particular location. For instance, the apostle Paul addresses local congregations, such as the "church in Corinth" (1 Corinthians 1:2) and the "church of the Thessalonians" (1 Thessalonians 1:1). These local churches serve as communities of believers where worship and fellowship occur.

2. **The Universal Church**: The term also signifies the universal body of believers throughout all time, united in their faith in Christ. This concept is articulated in passages like Ephesians 1:22-23, which describes the church as the body of Christ, with Christ himself as the head, emphasizing unity across all believers.

3. **The Church as a Spiritual Entity**: The church is viewed as a spiritual community that transcends geographical locations and cultural boundaries. It includes all true believers, highlighting that the church is more than just a physical building or an institutional organization; it is the living body of Christ on Earth.

4. **The Church's Purpose**: The church has a divinely ordained mission to worship God, proclaim the gospel, teach and disciple believers, and serve others. This is underscored in the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) and exemplified in the early church's practices (Acts 2:42-47).

In summary, in the New Testament, the term 'church' refers to both local assemblies of believers and the universal body of Christ, emphasizing the spiritual unity, mission, and community among those who follow Jesus. This multifaceted understanding reflects the depth and significance of the church in the life of believers and their collective journey in faith.
