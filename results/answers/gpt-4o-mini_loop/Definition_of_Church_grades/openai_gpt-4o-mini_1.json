  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the term 'church' in the New Testament, going beyond just local assemblies to include the universal body of believers and emphasizing the church as a spiritual entity with a divinely ordained mission. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting that the church is more than just a physical building. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a strong and well-articulated response."
