  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive understanding of the term 'church' in the New Testament, encompassing local congregations, the universal body of believers, the spiritual entity of the church, and the church's purpose beyond just physical buildings. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing that the church is not limited to a mere physical structure but is a living body of Christ with a divinely ordained mission. However, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have included more direct references to specific passages in the New Testament that highlight the church as a spiritual entity beyond buildings."
