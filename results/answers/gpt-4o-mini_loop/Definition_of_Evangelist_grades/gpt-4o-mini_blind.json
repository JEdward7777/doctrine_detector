It accurately explains the etymology of the word, its connection to the Gospel, and expands on its application beyond just the four Gospel authors. The only improvement would be to explicitly mention that evangelists can also be individuals who are specifically called to share the Gospel message with others, as highlighted in Ephesians 4:11."
