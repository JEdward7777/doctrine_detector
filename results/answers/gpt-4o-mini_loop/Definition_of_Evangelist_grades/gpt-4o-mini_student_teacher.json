  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'evangelist,' correctly attributing its literal meaning to \"someone who brings good news or proclaims the gospel.\" The student effectively tied this definition to the role of evangelists in Christian contexts, mentioning the authors of the Gospels and the broader application of the term to all who share the teachings of Jesus. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance and responsibilities associated with being an evangelist within the Christian faith."
