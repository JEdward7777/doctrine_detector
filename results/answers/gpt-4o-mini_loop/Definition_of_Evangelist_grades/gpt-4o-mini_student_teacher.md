## [Answer](../Definition_of_Evangelist.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The term 'evangelist' comes from the Greek word "euangelistes," which is derived from "euangelion," meaning "good news" or "gospel." Literally, an evangelist is someone who brings good news or proclaims the gospel. In a Christian context, this term traditionally refers to the authors of the four Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—who spread the message of Jesus Christ and His salvation. Additionally, the term can refer more broadly to anyone who faithfully shares the teachings and message of Jesus, actively participating in the Great Commission to spread the gospel to all nations.
