  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how the Biblical definition of 'good' contrasts with the concept of 'evil', rooted in the character and nature of God. The student accurately portrays 'good' as reflective of God's righteousness and holiness, while 'evil' is depicted as stemming from sin and disobedience to God. The inclusion of scriptural references enhances the explanation, and the concluding remarks on the victory of Christ over evil demonstrate a strong understanding of Christian doctrine. Overall, a well-structured and doctrinally sound response."
