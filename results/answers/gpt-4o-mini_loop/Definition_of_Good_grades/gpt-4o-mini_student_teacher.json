  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive explanation of the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil', linking them to the character of God and highlighting their implications for human behavior and decision-making. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the moral implications of these concepts in daily life and references relevant scriptures to support their points.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the practical application of these concepts in daily decision-making, as stated in the concern. While the response provides a theological overview of 'good' and 'evil', it could benefit from more specific examples or guidance on how individuals can navigate moral dilemmas and make choices aligned with God's will in their everyday lives."
