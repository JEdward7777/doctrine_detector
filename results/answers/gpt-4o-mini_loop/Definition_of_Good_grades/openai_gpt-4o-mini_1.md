## [Answer](../Definition_of_Good.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, the definition of 'good' is fundamentally rooted in the character and nature of God. The term 'good' is closely associated with righteousness, holiness, and alignment with God's divine will. For instance, in Genesis 1, after creating each aspect of the world, God declares His creation "good" (Genesis 1:31 states that everything He made was "very good"). This declaration emphasizes that 'good' reflects God's order, purpose, and perfection within His creation.

In contrast, the concept of 'evil' in the Bible is intrinsically linked to sin, disobedience to God, and anything that disrupts the harmony of His created order. Evil is often viewed as the absence or distortion of good. For example, Isaiah 5:20 warns against calling evil good and good evil, revealing a moral inversion that fosters chaos and separation from God. The biblical narrative presents evil as a force that actively opposes God's goodness, leading humanity away from His intended purpose.

Furthermore, evil is personified in various ways, most notably through Satan, who epitomizes rebellion against God's authority (John 10:10), and through sinful actions that arise from the human heart (Mark 7:21-23). The struggle between good and evil is a central theme throughout the Bible, culminating in the victory of Christ over sin and death, which offers redemption and restoration to all who believe.

In summary, 'good' corresponds with God's nature and His intended order for creation, while 'evil' signifies rebellion against that order, resulting in brokenness and separation from God. This contrast illustrates the foundational moral framework within which biblical theology operates, guiding believers in their understanding of right and wrong in the light of God's truth.
