  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that demonstrates a strong understanding of the term 'gospel' in the context of the Bible. They have effectively articulated the significance of the gospel in Christian faith and referenced key biblical verses to support their explanation. However, there is some additional elaboration beyond the reference answer, which while insightful and valuable, may slightly divert from the core question's focus."
