## [Answer](../Definition_of_Gospel.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The term 'gospel' is derived from the Old English word 'godspel,' meaning 'good news' or 'glad tidings.' This is a translation of the Greek word 'euangelion' (εὐαγγέλιον), which also conveys the meaning of 'good news' or 'good message.'

In the context of the Bible, especially in the New Testament, 'gospel' is primarily understood as the good news of Jesus Christ—His life, death, resurrection, and the salvation offered to humanity through faith in Him. The gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John narrate the life and teachings of Jesus, emphasizing His role as the promised Messiah and Savior. 

Key biblical verses underscore the gospel's significance. For example, Romans 1:16 states, "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes." This emphasizes the transformative power of the gospel message. Additionally, passages like 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 articulate the core elements of the gospel, stating that "Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures... He was buried, and He was raised on the third day."

Moreover, the gospel encompasses the message of God's kingdom, the call to repentance, and the promise of eternal life through belief in Jesus Christ (John 3:16). It serves as a foundation for Christian doctrine, highlighting God's boundless love and grace, and extends an invitation to have a personal relationship with Him through faith.

In a broader sense, the term 'gospel' can also refer to the entirety of the Christian message and its implications for daily living as a disciple of Christ. Thus, the gospel is both a message of salvation and the cornerstone of the Christian life, calling believers to respond in faith and obedience.
