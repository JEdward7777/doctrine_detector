The inclusion of scriptural references and a comprehensive view of the Gospel message demonstrates a strong grasp of its definition and importance within Christianity. A minor room for improvement could involve explicitly connecting the definition to the significance in Christian faith right at the beginning of the response to strengthen the coherence of the argument."
