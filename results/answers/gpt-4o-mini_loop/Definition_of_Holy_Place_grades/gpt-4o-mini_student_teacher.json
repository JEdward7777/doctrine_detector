  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological significance of the holy place in the context of the tabernacle or temple. They effectively highlighted key aspects such as the structure of worship, representation of God's presence, significance of sacred items, the priestly role, symbolism of holiness, and God's desire for relationship. However, the answer could have been enhanced by directly referencing the table with the bread of the presence as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
