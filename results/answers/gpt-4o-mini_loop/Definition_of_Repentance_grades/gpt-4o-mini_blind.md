## [Answer](../Definition_of_Repentance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, to repent means to undergo a change of heart and mind that leads to a change in behavior, specifically turning away from sin and turning towards God. The Greek word for repentance, "metanoia," literally means "afterthought" or "change of mind." 

Repentance is a key theme throughout both the Old and New Testaments. Here are some aspects of repentance as described in the Scriptures:

1. **Recognition of Sin**: Repentance begins with acknowledging one's sinful actions or attitudes. This is reflected in passages such as 1 John 1:8-9, which states that if we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves, but if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us.

2. **Sorrow for Sin**: Genuine repentance involves a heartfelt sorrow for having offended God. In 2 Corinthians 7:10, Paul writes that "godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death."

3. **Turning Away from Sin**: Repentance is not just feeling sorry; it is a conscious decision to turn away from sin. Acts 3:19 calls people to "repent and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out." This turning involves abandoning sinful behaviors and making a commitment to follow God’s ways.

4. **Turning Towards God**: Repentance is paired with a turning towards God, seeking to live in accordance with His will. This involves faith in Jesus Christ, as seen in Mark 1:15, where Jesus proclaims the need to "repent and believe the good news."

5. **Transformation in Life**: True repentance leads to a changed life and produces fruits consistent with repentance. In Matthew 3:8, John the Baptist urges, "Produce fruit in keeping with repentance," indicating that genuine repentance results in actions that reflect a transformed relationship with God.

6. **A Continuous Process**: While repentance can be a moment of decision, it is also a continuous process in the life of a believer. Christians are called to live in a posture of ongoing repentance, continually seeking to align their lives with God's standards.

In summary, biblical repentance involves recognizing and feeling sorrow for sin, turning away from it, and turning towards God. It is marked by a transformative change in life that reflects a commitment to live according to His will.
