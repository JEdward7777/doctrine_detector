It delves into key aspects such as separation for God, purification, growth in spiritual maturity, the dual nature of positional and progressive sanctification, and ultimate sanctification. The Christian-specific worldview is well articulated and supported by relevant biblical references. Great job in addressing the concern and expanding upon the biblical definition of sanctification."
