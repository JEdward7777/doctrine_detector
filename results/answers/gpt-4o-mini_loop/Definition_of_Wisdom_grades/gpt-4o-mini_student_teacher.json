  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer to the question, demonstrating a clear understanding of the biblical concept of wisdom. They effectively connected wisdom to the fear of the Lord, understanding and discernment, Christ as the ultimate source of wisdom, practical application, seeking counsel, enduring character, and an eternal perspective. The answer was thorough, incorporating relevant biblical references to support each aspect of wisdom. However, the student's response could have been further strengthened by directly addressing the teacher's reference answer and explicitly contrasting the outlined key aspects of biblical wisdom with the simplified definition offered by the teacher. This engagement would have showcased a deeper engagement with the concern provided."
