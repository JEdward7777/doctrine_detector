  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate overview of the biblical understanding of demon possession. The student effectively outlines key elements such as spiritual oppression, distinction from mental illness, the authority of Jesus and His followers, the purpose of exorcism, spiritual warfare, and theological implications. The explanations are well-supported by relevant scriptural references and demonstrate a solid grasp of Christian teachings on this topic. Great job overall!"
