  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 90. The student demonstrated a clear understanding of the distinctions between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" in a Christian context, providing detailed explanations and examples that align well with the reference answer from the teacher. The student also emphasized the importance of these terms in biblical contexts and the intent behind each form of communication. Overall, this response effectively clarifies the appropriate use of these terms according to scripture. Great job!"
