  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise explanation of each term, including their meanings, contexts, and examples from Scripture. The writer effectively breaks down the nuances of each word, demonstrating a good understanding of their differences. The summary at the end also helps to tie everything together and provide a sense of cohesion.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points for the following:\n\n1. While the response addresses the concern of clarifying the use of different forms of encouragement according to Scripture, it could be more explicit in highlighting how each term is used in different contexts or situations.\n2. The writer's own definition at the beginning, while generally accurate, could be more detailed and nuanced.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the terms \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" and their biblical applications. With some further development to address specific scenarios or contexts, it has the potential to be an even stronger response."
