  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and clear explanation of the distinctions between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" in a Christian context, addressing the concern by emphasizing the appropriate biblical use of different forms of encouragement. The incorporation of relevant Bible verses enhances the understanding of how these terms are applied in the Christian faith. The only minor area for improvement would be to include more direct scriptural references in the explanation to further emphasize the basis for these concepts in the Bible."
