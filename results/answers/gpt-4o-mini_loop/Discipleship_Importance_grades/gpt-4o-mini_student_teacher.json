They effectively highlighted various theological and practical reasons for Jesus choosing the twelve apostles as his closest disciples, linking it to divine selection, representation of Israel, intimate training, empowerment for ministry, diversity of backgrounds, fulfillment of prophecy, and specific roles and characteristics. While the answer goes beyond the reference answer in depth and detail, it effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating a strong grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
