The choice of the twelve apostles by Jesus as His closest disciples is significant for several reasons, both theological and practical.

1. **Divine Selection**: Jesus’ choice of the twelve apostles came after a night of prayer, indicating that their selection was divinely ordained (Luke 6:12-13). This divine guidance emphasizes their crucial role in God's redemptive plan and the foundation of the early Church.

2. **Representation of Israel**: The number twelve is significant, as it corresponds to the twelve tribes of Israel. By selecting twelve apostles, Jesus symbolically indicated the establishment of a new Israel or a renewed covenant community. This resonated with Jewish followers and demonstrated that the Kingdom of God was being inaugurated through Jesus' ministry.

3. **Intimate Training and Relationship**: The apostles enjoyed a close relationship with Jesus, which allowed them to receive direct teaching, witness His miracles, and learn from His example. This intimate association was essential for their preparation as leaders in the early Church (Mark 3:14).

4. **Empowerment for Ministry**: Jesus called the apostles not only to follow Him but also to be empowered for ministry. He commissioned them to preach, heal, and cast out demons, granting them authority to continue His work after His resurrection and ascension (Matthew 10:1).

5. **Diversity of Backgrounds**: The apostles came from varied backgrounds—fishermen, a tax collector, and others—reflecting the inclusivity of Jesus’ message. This diversity was intentional, as it allowed them to reach a broader audience and exemplified that the Gospel is meant for all people, regardless of their past.

6. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**: The selection of the apostles fulfilled Old Testament prophecies concerning God's plan for His people and the coming Messiah, who would initiate a new covenant (Isaiah 43:1-7). 

7. **Specific Roles and Characteristics**: Each apostle had unique traits and roles that contributed to their collective mission. For example, Peter's leadership qualities, John’s close relationship with Jesus, and Matthew’s background as a tax collector provided varied perspectives and skills that were instrumental in the early Church’s development. Their different experiences and perspectives enriched the teachings and outreach of the gospel.

In summary, Jesus chose the twelve apostles to fulfill divine purpose, symbolize the new Israel, train and empower them for ministry, illustrate diversity in leadership, fulfill scriptural prophecy, and capitalize on their unique traits for the spread of Christianity. Their selection underscores the foundational role they would have in the growth and establishment of the Church.
