It not only expands on the chosen answer by delving into key theological and practical reasons for their selection but also connects their role to broader biblical themes such as divine selection, representation of Israel, intimate training, empowerment for ministry, diversity of backgrounds, fulfillment of prophecy, and specific roles and characteristics. The response effectively demonstrates a deep understanding of the apostles' importance in the early Church, supported by relevant biblical references. Great job!"
