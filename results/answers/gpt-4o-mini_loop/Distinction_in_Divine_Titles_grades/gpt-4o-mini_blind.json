  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of why it is important not to translate 'Lord Yahweh' as 'Lord LORD' from a Christian perspective. The student effectively articulates the theological significance, historical context, and implications for accurate interpretation. The response could be enhanced by incorporating more Scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
