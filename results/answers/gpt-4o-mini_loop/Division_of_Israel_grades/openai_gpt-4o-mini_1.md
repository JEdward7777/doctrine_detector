After King Solomon's reign, a significant event in Israel's history was the division of the united monarchy. Following Solomon's death around 931 BC, the kingdom was split into two separate kingdoms: the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. This division arose due to political tensions and dissatisfaction among the tribes of Israel, especially concerning heavy taxation and forced labor policies instituted during Solomon's rule. 

However, this division also had profound spiritual and moral implications rooted in the peopleâ€™s disobedience to God's commandments. Scripture reveals that the hearts of the people, including Solomon himself in his later years, turned away from following God completely (1 Kings 11:4-10). As a result, God permitted the split as a consequence of their unfaithfulness, warning through the prophet Ahijah that the kingdom would be torn away from Rehoboam (1 Kings 11:29-31). Jeroboam became the king of the northern kingdom of Israel, while Rehoboam, Solomon's son, ascended to the throne of Judah. 

This division led to differing religious practices, with Jeroboam introducing idol worship in the north to deter his subjects from traveling to Jerusalem, which further distanced the tribes from their covenant with God. The conflict and division between the two kingdoms had lasting effects on Israel's history and its relationship with surrounding nations, serving as a reminder of the importance of obedience to God's laws and the consequences of turning away from Him.
