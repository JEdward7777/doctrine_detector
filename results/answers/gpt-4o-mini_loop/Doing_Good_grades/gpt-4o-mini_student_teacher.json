  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85.\n\nThe student's response effectively explains the concept of \"do good to\" within a Christian context, drawing from key Biblical teachings and providing specific examples of how this principle is lived out in Christian faith. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the importance of active love, service, and kindness towards others as central aspects of Christian living. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern provided and simplifying some of the explanations to align more closely with the reference answer."
