## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Bible does not specify a precise duration for "the last days." This term is used in various contexts throughout Scripture to describe a period leading up to the return of Christ and the culmination of God’s redemptive work. For example, in Acts 2:17, Peter quotes the prophet Joel, stating that in the last days, God will pour out His Spirit on all people. Moreover, Hebrews 1:2 highlights that God has spoken to us "in these last days" through His Son.

The New Testament further references "the last days" in passages like 1 Timothy 4:1 and 2 Timothy 3:1, where Paul outlines the characteristics and challenges of this period. However, the exact timing and duration remain unspecified. In Matthew 24:36, Jesus Himself reinforces this uncertainty by stating that no one knows the day or hour of His return, not even the angels in heaven, but only the Father.

In summary, while the Bible elaborates on the nature and significance of the last days, it does not provide a defined timeframe for their duration. This lack of specificity serves as a reminder for believers to remain vigilant and faithful, living in a state of readiness for the imminent return of Christ.
