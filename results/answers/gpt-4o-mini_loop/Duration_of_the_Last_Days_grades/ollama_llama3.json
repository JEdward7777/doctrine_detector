  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies that the Bible does not specify a precise duration for \"the last days,\" which aligns with the given answer. It also addresses the concern by highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Christ's return and its implications for Christian living. The writer wisely notes that this lack of specificity serves as a reminder to remain vigilant and faithful, living in a state of readiness.\n\nTo improve, I would suggest adding more depth to the discussion on how Christians can practically apply the uncertainty surrounding \"the last days\" in their daily lives. For example, the response could explore ways in which believers can prioritize spiritual disciplines, such as prayer and Scripture reading, or develop habits that promote a sense of anticipation and readiness for Christ's return.\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses both the given answer and the concern, providing biblical support and insightful application. With some further development on practical implications, this response could be even stronger."
