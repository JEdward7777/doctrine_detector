  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a well-articulated response that accurately addresses the concern raised. The student effectively explains the concept of \"the last days\" as depicted in the Bible and acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding its duration. They also emphasize the importance of believers remaining vigilant and faithful in anticipation of Christ's return despite this uncertainty. The only room for improvement could be to include a more explicit connection between the uncertainty of the last days and its impact on how Christians should live out their faith."
