  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe student's initial answer only mentions that the ephod was \"specially embroidered with gold, blue, purple, and red yarn,\" which covers some but not all of the specific materials listed in the correct description (Exodus 28). This lack of detail limits the student's understanding of the significance of the ephod's design.\n\nHowever, when considering the concern that knowing the specific materials highlights the importance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship, the student does attempt to capture some of the symbolic meaning behind the use of these materials. They mention that the colors represent \"royalty, holiness, and the divine nature of God,\" which shows an awareness of the significance of the ephod's design.\n\nTo reach a higher grade, the student could have provided more accurate information about the specific materials used in the ephod's construction, such as mentioning the use of fine linen as well. Additionally, further exploration of the symbolic meanings behind each material would have strengthened their understanding and response."
