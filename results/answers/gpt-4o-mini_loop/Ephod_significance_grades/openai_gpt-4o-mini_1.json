It effectively expands upon the given answer by delving into the liturgical role, materials and design, symbol of authority and holiness, connection to divine guidance, and foreshadowing of Christ. The theological connections made between the ephod and Jesus Christ as the ultimate high priest are particularly commendable. The integration of biblical references and Christian worldview enhances the understanding of the ephod's importance in the Old Testament priesthood and worship practices."
