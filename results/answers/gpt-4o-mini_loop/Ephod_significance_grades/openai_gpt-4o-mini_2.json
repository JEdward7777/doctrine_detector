It goes beyond the basic description provided in the initial answer and delves into the symbolic, theological, and practical aspects of the ephod, connecting it to the broader themes of priesthood, divine guidance, and the foreshadowing of Jesus Christ. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how understanding the role of the ephod enhances one's comprehension of Old Testament priesthood and worship practices."
