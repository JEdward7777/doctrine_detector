  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained understanding of the nature of the Trinity in Christian theology, addressing the essence, distinct persons, relational roles, scriptural basis, and the unity of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. The student showcased a strong grasp of the concept and effectively applied it to orthodox Christian faith. The only minor improvement could have been a more direct reference to the teacher's answer as the foundation of the response."
