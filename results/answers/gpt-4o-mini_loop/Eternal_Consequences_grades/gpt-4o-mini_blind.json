  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and doctrinally sound explanation of the eternal consequences for those described as 'perishing' in Christian theology. The student effectively outlines key consequences such as separation from God, eternal punishment, loss of eternal life, and living under God's wrath, supported by relevant scriptural references. The response emphasizes the importance of repentance and accepting God's salvation through Jesus Christ to avoid these dire consequences. Well done."
