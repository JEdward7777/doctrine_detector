  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that aligns with Christian theology regarding the eternal consequences for those described as 'perishing.' The student effectively addressed the concern of understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God by discussing the concepts of separation from God, eternal punishment, loss of eternal life, and living under God's wrath. The response demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic and effectively connected it to Christian beliefs."
