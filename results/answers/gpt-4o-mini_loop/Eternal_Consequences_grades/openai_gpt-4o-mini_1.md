In Christian theology, the term "perishing" refers to individuals who are in a state of separation from God due to sin and unbelief. The Bible often contrasts eternal life with perishing, demonstrating that those who reject God's grace and salvation through Jesus Christ face serious eternal consequences.

Key eternal consequences for those described as perishing include:

1. **Separation from God**: A primary consequence is eternal separation from God, who is the source of life, goodness, and love. This separation is frequently described as spiritual death, as noted in Revelation 20:14 and Matthew 25:41.

2. **Eternal Punishment**: Many scriptures suggest that those who perish experience eternal punishment or condemnation. For instance, in Matthew 25:46, Jesus states, "these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life." This suggests a conscious existence apart from God, marked by suffering.

3. **Loss of Eternal Life**: The New Testament emphasizes that eternal life is a gift from God, granted through faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:16, Romans 6:23). Those who perish do not receive this gift and, as a result, lack the hope and promise of everlasting life with God.

4. **Under God's Wrath**: In John 3:36, it declares, "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them." This indicates that those who perish live under the consequence of God’s wrath due to their rejection of Christ.

In summary, the eternal consequences for those who are perishing in Christian theology involve separation from God, potential eternal punishment, loss of eternal life, and living under God's wrath. The central message in Christian teaching is the urgent call to repent and accept God's offer of salvation through Jesus Christ to avoid these consequences.
