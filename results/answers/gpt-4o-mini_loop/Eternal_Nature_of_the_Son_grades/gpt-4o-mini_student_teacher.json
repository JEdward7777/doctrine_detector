  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response that accurately distinguishes the Son of God from human sons in terms of existence and eternal nature. The answer effectively highlights key theological principles and emphasizes the preeminence and eternal nature of Jesus as the Son of God. The specific points touched upon align closely with the concern provided, showcasing a deep understanding of Christian doctrine. The slight deviation from the reference answer does not significantly detract from the overall quality of the response."
