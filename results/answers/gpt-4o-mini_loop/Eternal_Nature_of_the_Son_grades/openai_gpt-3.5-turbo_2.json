It effectively articulates key distinctions between the Son of God and human sons, emphasizing the eternal nature and divine essence of Jesus as foundational to understanding His role in salvation and relationship within the Trinity. The response aligns well with the concern regarding highlighting the unique and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God."
