  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively articulates the Christian perspective on the concept of eternal punishment in Hell as reflecting God's justice. It provides solid reasoning supported by scriptural references and theological principles. The answer demonstrates an understanding of key Christian beliefs regarding sin, free will, divine justice, holiness, and the rejection of grace. The student effectively communicates the challenging nature of this doctrine while emphasizing its alignment with the broader narrative of God's character and human choices. Well done!"
