  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice, covering various theological aspects such as the nature of sin, free will, divine justice, holiness of God, scriptural basis, and the rejection of grace. The answer effectively discusses these points in relation to the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in eternal consequences. However, the student's response could have been more concise and directly tied back to the reference answer provided by the teacher. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
