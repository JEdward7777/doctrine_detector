It addresses the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences by highlighting key points such as the nature of sin, free will and accountability, divine justice, the holiness of God, scriptural basis, and the rejection of grace. The response effectively demonstrates how eternal punishment in hell is viewed as a just consequence for those who reject God's salvation plan, emphasizing the seriousness of human choices and the implications of rejecting God's mercy."
