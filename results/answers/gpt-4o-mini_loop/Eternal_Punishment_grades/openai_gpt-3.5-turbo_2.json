  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-articulated explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell aligns with God's justice, holiness, and righteousness within Christian theology. It effectively addresses the concern raised about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences by discussing sin, free will, accountability, divine justice, the holiness of God, scriptural basis, and the rejection of grace. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on this topic and presents a cohesive argument supported by relevant theological principles and biblical references."
