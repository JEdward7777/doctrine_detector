  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-articulated explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell aligns with God's justice, addressing concerns about the nature of divine justice and mercy. It effectively integrates key theological principles, such as the nature of sin, free will, divine justice, the holiness of God, Scripture, and the rejection of grace, to support the understanding of eternal consequences for those who reject Jesus' sacrifice. The response offers a comprehensive and coherent Christian perspective on this challenging topic."
