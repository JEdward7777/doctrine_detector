  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and insightful examination of the significance of the encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch in the context of the early church. The student effectively highlights key themes such as the expansion of the Gospel, inclusion and equality, personal conversion and baptism, the role of the Holy Spirit, and evangelism and discipleship. The analysis is well-supported with references to relevant biblical passages and theological implications. Great job overall."
