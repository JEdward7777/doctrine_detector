## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In Matthew 19:12, Jesus refers to eunuchs within the context of His teachings on marriage, divorce, and celibacy. The verse states: “For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”

In this passage, Jesus highlights three categories of eunuchs:

1. **Eunuchs who were born that way**: This may pertain to individuals who are physically unable to marry or those who have a disposition that leads them away from sexual relationships.

2. **Eunuchs made by others**: This likely refers to those who have been castrated or incapacitated, often for specific societal roles, such as serving in royal households.

3. **Eunuchs who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven**: In this instance, Jesus introduces the concept of voluntary celibacy—deliberately choosing to remain unmarried and abstain from sexual relationships to devote oneself more fully to God's service.

The relationship between Jesus’ teaching and celibacy emphasizes the intentional decision to pursue a life of restraint for spiritual purposes. Celibacy, in this light, is viewed as a legitimate and commendable vocation for those feeling called to serve God in that capacity. It allows individuals to focus entirely on their spiritual life without the distractions often associated with marriage and family responsibilities.

Biblically, the apostle Paul further elaborates on this theme in 1 Corinthians 7, where he presents celibacy as a gift from God. Paul acknowledges both marriage and celibacy as valid pathways within the Christian life, but he particularly highlights the advantages of celibacy for those who can accept this calling. He emphasizes that celibacy enables deeper devotion to the Lord and freedom to serve without the divided interests that marriage can entail.

Celibacy also embodies a form of self-denial and sacrifice for the sake of the kingdom, mirroring Jesus' own teachings on taking up one's cross and following Him (Matthew 16:24). Ultimately, the key message from Jesus is that one's commitment to God can take various forms—whether through the covenant of marriage or a life of celibacy dedicated to His service. Both are valued within the Christian faith, reflecting unique expressions of love and devotion to God.
