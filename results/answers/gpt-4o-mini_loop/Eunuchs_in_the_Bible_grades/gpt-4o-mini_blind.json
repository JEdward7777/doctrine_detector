  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response at 90.\n\nThe student demonstrates a solid understanding of the passage in Matthew 19:12 and effectively explains the three categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus within the context of marriage, divorce, and celibacy. The explanation of celibacy as a legitimate vocation for individuals feeling called to serve God is well-supported with references to both Jesus' teachings and the apostle Paul's writings in 1 Corinthians 7. The connection between celibacy and a deeper devotion to the Lord is well-articulated, and the student appropriately highlights the theme of self-denial and sacrifice for the sake of the kingdom.\n\nOne improvement could be to provide a bit more emphasis on the doctrinal aspects of celibacy as it pertains to the Catholic Church, for example, referencing the practice of celibacy among priests and religious. Incorporating additional theological perspectives on celibacy within the Christian tradition could enrich the analysis."
