  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response that effectively connects Jesus' teaching on eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 to the concept of celibacy. The student's analysis of the three categories of eunuchs and their relation to celibacy was insightful and displayed a good understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy. The student also effectively incorporated additional biblical references, like Paul's teachings in 1 Corinthians 7, to support their points. Overall, a well-reasoned and well-written answer."
