  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of Jesus' teaching on eunuchs and its relevance to the concept of celibacy. The answer is well-organized, providing clear explanations of the different categories of eunuchs and their significance. The student also skillfully connects the idea of voluntary celibacy to the pursuit of spiritual growth and freedom from the distractions of marriage. The biblical references to 1 Corinthians 7 and Matthew 16:24 further strengthen the argument. The overall clarity, depth of understanding, and well-articulated conclusion contribute to a high grade."
