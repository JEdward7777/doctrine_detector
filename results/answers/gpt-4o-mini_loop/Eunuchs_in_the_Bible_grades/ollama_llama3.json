  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response accurately summarizes Jesus' teachings on eunuchs in Matthew 19:12, correctly identifying three categories: those born that way, those made by others, and those who choose to live like eunuchs for the kingdom's sake. It also effectively connects these teachings to the concept of celibacy and its significance within the Christian life.\n\nThe response goes beyond a simple summary, however, by exploring the biblical perspective on celibacy in 1 Corinthians 7 and highlighting its advantages as a means of deeper devotion to God and freedom from divided interests. The connection between Jesus' teachings and self-denial/sacrifice for the kingdom is also well-made.\n\nOne area for improvement would be to more explicitly emphasize the significance of intentionality and choice in the third category of eunuchs, which may not be immediately clear to all readers. Nonetheless, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and its different forms, earning it a high grade."
