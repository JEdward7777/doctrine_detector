It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the different reasons for choosing a life without marriage, highlighting the value and legitimacy of celibacy as a vocation for those called to serve God in that capacity. The integration of relevant biblical references, theological reflections, and application of Christian principles on self-denial and devotion to God is thorough and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Well done!"
