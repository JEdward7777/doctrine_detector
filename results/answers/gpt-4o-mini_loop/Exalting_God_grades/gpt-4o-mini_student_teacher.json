  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed answer on what it means to exalt God in daily life, encompassing various aspects such as worship, living out faith, gratitude, service, decision-making, studying Scripture, sharing the Gospel, cultivating Christ-like character, prayer, repentance, and surrender. The student has shown a strong understanding of the importance of exalting God in all areas of life and has provided practical steps to achieve this. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the simplicity of highly praising and honoring God through worship, prayer, and obedience to His will, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
