  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound analysis of the Parable of the Good Samaritan, focusing on key theological themes such as love for neighbor, challenging religious norms, practical compassion, the nature of true discipleship, and redemptive love. The explanation is well-structured, backed by relevant scriptural references, and effectively highlights the significance of the parable within a Christian worldview. Great job overall."
