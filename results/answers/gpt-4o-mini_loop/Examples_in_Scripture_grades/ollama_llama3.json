  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response thoroughly addresses the concern by providing several examples of demon possession in the Bible, including detailed descriptions of Jesus' authority over demonic forces. The response also highlights the transformative power of faith and deliverance offered by Jesus. Additionally, the inclusion of specific biblical references (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39, etc.) demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical narrative.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not directly address the idea that these examples are relevant to contemporary faith. While it can be inferred that the account of Jesus' authority over demonic forces has relevance to today's spiritual struggles, the connection could be made more explicit. Overall, however, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical narrative and its significance."
