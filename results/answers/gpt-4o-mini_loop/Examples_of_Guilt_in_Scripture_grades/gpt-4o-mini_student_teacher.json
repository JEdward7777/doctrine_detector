  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtfully written response, including multiple examples from the Bible that vividly illustrate the concept of guilt. The examples chosen effectively demonstrate the different dimensions and consequences of guilt in various biblical narratives. Although the reference answer highlighted a different example that could have been included for a more comprehensive perspective, the student's answer is well-structured, insightful, and spiritually reflective."
