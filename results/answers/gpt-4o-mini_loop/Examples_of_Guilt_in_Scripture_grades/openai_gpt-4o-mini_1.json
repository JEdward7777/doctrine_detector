The examples chosen effectively demonstrate the moral and spiritual consequences of guilt, underscoring the need for repentance and divine forgiveness. However, while the response offers a comprehensive exploration of guilt in the Bible, it does not directly address the concern about how guilt operates in the context of justice, innocence, and the need for divine judgment. Integrating this aspect into the analysis would have further enhanced the understanding of guilt from a Christian worldview perspective."
