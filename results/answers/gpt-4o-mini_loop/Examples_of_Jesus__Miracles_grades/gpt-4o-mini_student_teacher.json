  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as a 95.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough and detailed list of specific miracles performed by Jesus, along with their theological implications. Each miracle is explained in terms of its significance and theological message, connecting them to broader themes of Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the establishment of God's kingdom. The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of how these miracles strengthen belief in Jesus' divinity.\n\nDespite the comprehensive nature of the response, the only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the direct connection between the miracles and the student's belief in Jesus as the Son of God. This would further strengthen the alignment with the concern provided."
