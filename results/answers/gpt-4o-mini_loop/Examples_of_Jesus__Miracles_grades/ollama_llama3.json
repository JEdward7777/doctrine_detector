  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response goes far beyond the simple answer, providing a detailed and nuanced understanding of Jesus' miracles. The writer not only lists various examples but also explains their significance in terms of Jesus' divinity and God's kingdom. This shows a deep understanding of the theological implications of each miracle and how they relate to our faith in Jesus as the Son of God.\n\nThe response is well-organized, clear, and easy to follow, with each section building on the previous one to create a cohesive narrative. The writer also uses relevant biblical references, which adds credibility and authority to their claims.\n\nOne area for improvement could be to provide more specific examples from each miracle to illustrate its significance, rather than simply listing them. Additionally, while the response is strong in terms of theological analysis, it may benefit from more personal reflection on how recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles can help us believe in Him as the Son of God.\n\nOverall, however, this response is an excellent example of a thoughtful and well-written answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic."
