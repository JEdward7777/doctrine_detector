The student accurately defines faith and trust, provides relevant biblical examples, and explains how trust is rooted in God's character. The response could be strengthened by emphasizing the grace of God as the source of faith and trust, and by incorporating more scriptural references throughout the explanation. Additionally, connecting trust and faith to the work of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives would enhance the theological depth of the answer."
