To "believe in Jesus" in Christian theology generally means to have faith in Him as the Son of God, the Savior of humanity, and the source of eternal life. This belief encompasses several key aspects:

1. **Trust in His Divinity**: Believing in Jesus involves recognizing Him as divine, affirming His identity as the Son of God, and part of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).

2. **Acceptance of His Sacrifice**: Central to belief in Jesus is the understanding and acceptance of His death on the cross as atonement for sin. Christians believe that through His crucifixion and resurrection, Jesus offers forgiveness and reconciliation with God.

3. **Commitment to His Teachings**: Believing in Jesus also means following His teachings and example, as presented in the Gospels. This includes living a life characterized by love, service, and obedience to Godâ€™s commandments.

4. **Personal Relationship**: It signifies a personal relationship with Jesus, where one seeks to know Him through prayer, worship, reading the Scriptures, and engaging in community with other believers.

5. **Hope in Resurrection**: Christians believe that through Jesus, there is the promise of eternal life, and that faith in Him guarantees resurrection from the dead for those who believe.

In essence, to believe in Jesus is to place one's faith, trust, and hope in Him for salvation and to live out that faith in everyday life. This belief is often illustrated in verses such as John 3:16, which states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
