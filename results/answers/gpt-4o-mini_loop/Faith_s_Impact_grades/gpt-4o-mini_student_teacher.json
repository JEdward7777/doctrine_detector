  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer detailing various ways true faith in Jesus can manifest in a person's life, in alignment with Christian beliefs. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and is supported by relevant biblical references. However, the student's response delves into specific manifestations of faith and characteristics of a believer without explicitly addressing the concern of recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer. Thus, while the content is strong, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing how these manifestations provide evidence of genuine faith in daily life."
