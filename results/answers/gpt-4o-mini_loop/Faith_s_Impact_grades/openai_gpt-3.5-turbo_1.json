It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting specific observable manifestations of genuine faith and aligning them with Christian beliefs and teachings. The inclusion of biblical references enhances the credibility of the response within a Christian worldview. Great job in integrating scriptural principles with practical applications of faith."
