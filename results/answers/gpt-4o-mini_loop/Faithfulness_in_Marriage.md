The Bible places a strong emphasis on faithfulness in marriage and explicitly condemns adultery as a violation of the marital covenant. Several passages highlight the importance of fidelity and the serious nature of infidelity:

1. **Exodus 20:14** - One of the Ten Commandments states, "You shall not commit adultery." This command underscores the expectation of loyalty and faithfulness within the marriage relationship, affirming that such fidelity is not only a moral obligation but also a reflection of a faithful heart.

2. **Matthew 5:27-28** - In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus taught that not only is the act of adultery sinful, but even lustful thoughts towards another person can be seen as a form of adultery in the heart. This teaching emphasizes that faithfulness in marriage extends beyond physical actions to the purity of our thoughts and intentions, calling us to a deeper commitment.

3. **Hebrews 13:4** - This passage states, "Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral." It underscores the sanctity of marriage and the severe consequences of violating that sacred bond, reinforcing the need for a commitment to purity and faithfulness.

4. **1 Corinthians 6:9-10** - The Apostle Paul warns that those who engage in adultery (along with other sins) will not inherit the kingdom of God, highlighting the spiritual consequences of such actions and reiterating the importance of living a life aligned with God's will.

5. **Malachi 2:14-16** - In this passage, God expresses His displeasure with unfaithfulness in marriage and emphasizes that He hates divorce. This reflects the seriousness with which God regards marriage and the call to remain faithful to oneâ€™s spouse.

6. **Ephesians 5:31** - This verse cites Genesis, stating that a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife, indicating the deep bond and commitment inherent in marriage. It signifies that this union is intended to be enduring and should be honored.

Overall, the Bible teaches that marriage is a sacred covenant designed by God, and faithfulness within that covenant is crucial. Adultery is viewed as a serious offense that can have significant relational and spiritual consequences. Faithfulness is not just an expectation but also reflects God's unwavering faithfulness to His people, serving as a model for how we are to conduct our marital relationships.
