  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 95. \n\nThe student provided a thorough and well-structured response that deeply explores the significance of giving false testimony in a Christian context. They effectively referenced key Bible verses and connected them to the broader themes of moral integrity, witnessing to others, community trust, and God's justice. The student's analysis demonstrates a strong understanding of how truthfulness is foundational to Christian beliefs and practices. While the student's answer is comprehensive and insightful, the slight variance in emphasis and depth compared to the reference answer accounts for a slightly lower grade."
