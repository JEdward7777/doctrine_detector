In a biblical context, to 'find favor' with someone refers to receiving goodwill, grace, or approval from that person, often implying a special relationship or a blessing. This concept is prevalent throughout Scripture and encompasses a range of spiritual and relational dynamics.

1. **Divine Favor**: Finding favor is frequently associated with God's grace. For instance, Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord (Genesis 6:8), indicating that he was chosen by God for his righteousness amidst a corrupt world. Similarly, Mary, the mother of Jesus, is described as having found favor with God (Luke 1:30), signifying her selection for a unique and significant role in the redemptive plan of salvation.

2. **Human Relationships**: The concept of finding favor can also apply to positive relationships between people. An example is Joseph, who found favor in the eyes of Potiphar (Genesis 39:4), which led to his elevation in status within Potiphar's household. In the New Testament, the apostles found favor with the people (Acts 2:47), reflecting a harmonious relationship between the early church and its surrounding community.

3. **Implications of Favor**: Finding favor often entails more than mere approval; it implies support and assistance. For instance, Esther found favor in the eyes of King Ahasuerus (Esther 2:17), which resulted in her becoming queen and enabled her to influence significant events for her people.

4. **Conditions for Favor**: In biblical narratives, favor is frequently linked to humility, obedience, and faithfulness. Proverbs 3:3-4 emphasizes that loyalty and faithfulness will lead to finding favor and a good reputation in the sight of God and people.

In summary, to 'find favor' in a biblical context signifies being graced or blessed by God or gaining goodwill and approval in human relationships. It is often interconnected with righteousness, faithfulness, and a divine purpose that guides one's life and interactions.
