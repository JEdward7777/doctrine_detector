  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has given a clear and detailed explanation of what it means to \"find grace in the eyes of God\" from a Christian perspective. They have correctly highlighted the key concepts of divine favor, righteousness, unmerited blessing, and redemption within the context of God's grace. The answer effectively connects the concept to biblical examples and culminates in the understanding of salvation through Jesus Christ. The only improvement could be to further emphasize the foundational belief that grace is solely a gift from God and cannot be earned by human efforts."
