The answer accurately presents the Calvinist and Arminian perspectives on predestination. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, it could have further emphasized the biblical basis and nuance of these doctrines, especially in discussing the tension between God's sovereignty and human free will. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the underlying biblical evidence supporting these doctrines would strengthen the response."
