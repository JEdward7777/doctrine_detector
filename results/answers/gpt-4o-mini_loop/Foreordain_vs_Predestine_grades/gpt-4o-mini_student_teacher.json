  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the terms 'foreordain' and 'predestine' in Christian theology, including their meanings, biblical references, and implications. The student effectively differentiated between the two terms and discussed how they relate to God's sovereignty and human free will. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly state the teacher's reference answer at the beginning to align the response more closely with the specified concern of clarifying the relationship between similar theological concepts. Overall, a strong and well-informed answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
