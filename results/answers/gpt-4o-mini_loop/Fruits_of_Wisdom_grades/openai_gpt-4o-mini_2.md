2. **Joy** - A deep and abiding sense of happiness and contentment, rooted in a relationship with God, regardless of circumstances.
3. **Peace** - A tranquility and harmony both within oneself and in relationships with others, stemming from trust in God.
4. **Patience** - The ability to endure difficulties and delays with a calm demeanor and without frustration or anger.
5. **Kindness** - A disposition to be generous and helpful, reflecting compassion and consideration for others.
6. **Goodness** - Moral integrity and a desire to do good, reflecting Godâ€™s nature in action.
7. **Faithfulness** - Reliability and loyalty in relationships, as well as steadfastness in faith and trust in God.
