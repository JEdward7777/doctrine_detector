  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively discusses the importance of fulfilling promises or vows before God from a Christian perspective, citing relevant Scriptures to support their argument. They accurately emphasize the significance of integrity, faithfulness, and obedience to God in keeping one's word. However, they could have provided more direct focus on the impact of failing to fulfill promises on one's faith, as outlined in the concern provided. Overall, a strong and well-supported perspective with room for slight improvement."
