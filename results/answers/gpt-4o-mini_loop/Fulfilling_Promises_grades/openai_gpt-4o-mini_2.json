It effectively references relevant biblical verses to support the importance of fulfilling promises made before God. The inclusion of scriptural references and the emphasis on the relationship between integrity, obedience to God, and faithfulness greatly enrich the response. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern within a Christian worldview."
