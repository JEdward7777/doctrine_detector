In Biblical teaching, when a prophecy is said to be fulfilled, it signifies that the events or circumstances foretold by a prophet have occurred as declared by God. This concept encompasses several important aspects:

1. **Specific Events**: Fulfillment refers to precise events predicted by prophets in the Old Testament that later transpired in history. For example, prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah, such as His birth in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2) and His suffering (Isaiah 53), are seen as fulfilled in the New Testament through the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.

2. **Confirmation of Divine Authority**: The fulfillment of prophecy affirms God’s authority and sovereignty over human history. When prophecies come to fruition, it illustrates that God's plans will ultimately be realized, strengthening believers' faith in His promises and the reliability of His Word.

3. **Typological Fulfillment**: Some fulfillments are typological, meaning that certain events or figures in the Old Testament foreshadow New Testament realities. A pertinent example is the Passover lamb, which symbolizes Christ as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, as described in John 1:29.

4. **Conditional vs. Unconditional Prophecies**: Prophecies can be classified as conditional or unconditional. Conditional prophecies depend on human response—such as those that call for repentance—while unconditional prophecies will be accomplished regardless of human action, as seen in predictions concerning the end times.

5. **Cumulative Fulfillment**: Some prophecies have multiple layers of fulfillment that can occur at various times or in different forms. An example is a prophecy that may find partial fulfillment in one historical moment, with a more complete fulfillment emerging later.

In summary, the fulfillment of prophecy in the Biblical context indicates that what was foretold has indeed transpired. This not only validates the truth of God's word but also enhances the understanding of His redemptive plan as revealed throughout Scripture, culminating in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
