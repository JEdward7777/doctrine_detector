  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of prophecy fulfillment in the Biblical context, covering various important aspects such as specific events, confirmation of divine authority, typological fulfillment, conditional vs. unconditional prophecies, and cumulative fulfillment. The response demonstrates an in-depth understanding of how God interacts with prophecy and its realization in Scripture. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in elaborating on additional aspects beyond the direct causation by God."
