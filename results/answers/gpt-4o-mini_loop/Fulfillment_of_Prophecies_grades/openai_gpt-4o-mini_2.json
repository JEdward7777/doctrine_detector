It not only expands upon the definition of fulfilled prophecy but also delves into the significance and implications of such fulfillment within Scripture. The inclusion of examples and distinctions between different types of prophecies further enriches the analysis. This response demonstrates a solid understanding of how God's interaction with prophecy manifests in Scripture. Great job!"
