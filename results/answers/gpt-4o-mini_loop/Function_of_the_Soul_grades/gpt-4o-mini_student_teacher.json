  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-articulated response that dives deep into the various figurative uses of the word 'soul' in the Bible and their implications for understanding human identity. The student effectively connected biblical passages to the broader discussion of human identity, spirituality, emotions, relationships, and eternity. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern provided, rather than expanding on additional theological implications."
