  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response that aligns with a Christian worldview by expanding the concept of 'holy places' beyond physical structures like the tabernacle or temple. The student effectively incorporates biblical references and theological reasoning to support their points. However, the response could have been strengthened by more directly addressing the concern of identifying places in life dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic within a Christian framework."
