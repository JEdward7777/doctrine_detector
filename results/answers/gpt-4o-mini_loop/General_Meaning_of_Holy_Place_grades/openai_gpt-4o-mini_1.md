The term 'holy place' can certainly be understood in a broader context beyond just the tabernacle or temple in several significant ways:

1. **Jesus Christ as the Ultimate Holy Place**: In the New Testament, Jesus is revealed as the fulfillment of the temple (John 2:19-21). He embodies the presence of God among us, and through Him, believers can enter into a direct relationship with God. His sacrificial death and resurrection provide access to the Father, making Him the ultimate holy space where we can encounter God’s presence.

2. **Sacredness of Creation**: The entire creation is seen as a reflection of God’s holiness (Genesis 1:31). Places where people encounter God's presence, such as mountains (e.g., Mount Sinai), gardens (e.g., Eden), or other natural settings, can also be considered 'holy places'.

3. **Believers as Temples**: The New Testament expands the concept of holiness to include believers themselves. In 1 Corinthians 6:19-20, Paul teaches that the body of a believer is a temple of the Holy Spirit. This means that wherever a believer goes, they carry the presence of God, transforming any location they inhabit into a 'holy place'.

4. **Community of Faith**: Churches and gatherings of believers can be understood as 'holy places'. Matthew 18:20 states, “For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them,” emphasizing that communal worship and fellowship are contexts where the presence of God is experienced.

5. **Personal Encounter with God**: Individuals can create 'holy places' in their own lives through personal prayer, meditation, and worship. Simple spaces in homes, like prayer corners or dedicated reading areas, can become sacred when they are spaces where one experiences a deep connection with God.

6. **Covenant and Presence**: Throughout the Bible, 'holy places' are where God manifests His presence as part of the covenant relationship with His people. This extends to everyday moments where believers experience divine guidance, support, or revelation.

7. **Historical Sites**: Places where significant biblical events occurred, like locations from Jesus' ministry, can be viewed as 'holy' because of their connection to God's unfolding plan through history.

8. **Spiritual Disciplines**: Engaging in spiritual disciplines, such as fasting, prayer, or worship, transforms any context into a 'holy place' as these practices deepen one’s encounter with God and His holiness.

In summary, while 'holy place' has specific historical and theological meanings within the context of the tabernacle and temple, it can also be broadened to encompass a variety of physical, communal, and personal spaces where God’s presence and holiness are acknowledged and experienced in the lives of believers. Central to this understanding is the acknowledgment of Jesus Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers, who together open the door to experiencing the divine in everyday life.
