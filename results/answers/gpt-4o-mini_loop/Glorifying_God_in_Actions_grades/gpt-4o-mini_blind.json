The references to Scripture are appropriate and support the points made. The answer could be further enhanced by emphasizing the centrality of faith in Jesus Christ for salvation and the importance of following Him as the ultimate way to glorify God. Also, a stronger emphasis on the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers to live out these principles would have been beneficial. Overall, a solid answer with room for some improvements."
