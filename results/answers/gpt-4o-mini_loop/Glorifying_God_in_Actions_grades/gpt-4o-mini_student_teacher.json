  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would rate this student's response a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily lives, they may have deviated slightly from the emphasis on the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness. The student's answer focused more on specific actions and behaviors that reflect Christian values, which are indeed important but may have overshadowed the core concern of emphasizing God's greatness.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of Christian principles and provided thoughtful examples supported by relevant Bible verses. However, a more direct connection to reflecting God's glory specifically in daily life could have enhanced the response."
