  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful analysis of Jesus's statement regarding goodness in the context of the interaction with the rich young ruler. They effectively highlighted the implications of Jesus affirming God's unique goodness, inviting reflection on the nature of goodness, revealing Christ's identity, encouraging humility, and affirming the Trinity. The response demonstrated a good understanding of Christian doctrine and effectively connected the teaching to broader theological concepts. However, it could have been strengthened by incorporating more direct scriptural references and deepening the explanation on how Jesus's statement relates to the broader theological implications of divine goodness."
