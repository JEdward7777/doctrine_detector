  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of Jesus' statement regarding goodness and its implications. They effectively highlighted the affirmation of God's unique goodness, the invitation to reflect on the nature of goodness, the revelation of Christ's identity, encouragement of humility, and affirmation of the Trinity. However, while the student's response was thorough and well-structured, it could have been more concise and focused directly on the reference answer provided by emphasizing the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the Christian worldview in interpreting Jesus' words."
