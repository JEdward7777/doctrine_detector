## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
When Jesus states, "There is only one who is good, and that is God," found in Mark 10:18 (and also in Matthew 19:17 and Luke 18:19), he is responding to a rich young ruler who addresses him as "Good Teacher." By making this profound statement, Jesus emphasizes the supreme goodness of God and distinguishes God's divine nature from that of any human being.

This statement serves several significant purposes:

1. **Affirmation of God's Unique Goodness**: Jesus highlights that true goodness originates solely from God. This assertion reflects the perfect nature of God, who embodies moral perfection and serves as the ultimate standard for goodness. 

2. **Inviting Reflection**: Jesus encourages the young ruler to ponder the nature of goodness and to examine his understanding of what it means to be "good." This moment challenges him (and the audience) to consider whether they fully grasp the implications of calling anyone "good" in the absolute sense.

3. **Revealing Christâ€™s Identity**: In a deeper sense, this teaching suggests the divinity of Christ. Through His life and ministry, Jesus reveals God's character. By pointing out that only God is good, Jesus invites us to recognize His unique relationship with the Father, implying that He, too, embodies divine goodness.

4. **Encouraging Humility**: The statement serves as a reminder that human endeavors to achieve goodness or righteousness fall short when measured against God's perfect standard. This humbles us and underscores the Christian belief in the necessity of divine grace over self-reliance in attaining goodness or righteousness.

5. **Affirmation of the Trinity**: This declaration also aligns with the broader Christian understanding of the Trinity. In identifying God as the only one who is good, Jesus affirms His own divine nature and the interconnectedness of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit within the divine essence. Recognizing Jesus's divinity in this context enriches our comprehension of God's unified goodness.

In essence, Jesus directs our focus to God as the ultimate source of goodness, encouraging a deeper understanding of morality that aligns with the biblical portrayal of human righteousness as measured by God's holy character. Through this lens, we gain a richer perspective of Christ's identity and His role within the divine framework of the Trinity.
