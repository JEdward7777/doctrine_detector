  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively demonstrates how the concept of a 'remnant' reflects God's selective grace towards His people. The response includes strong biblical foundations, theological insights, scriptural references, and connection to both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the significance of being chosen by God by emphasizing the unique identity, purpose, and responsibility of those within the remnant. The use of examples and explanations is thorough and coherent, showcasing a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job overall, with minor room for improvement in linking the response more directly to the teacher's reference answer."
