It effectively addresses the concern regarding the significance of being chosen by God by emphasizing God's selective grace, sovereignty, and redemptive plan through the remnant. The integration of Old and New Testament examples, as well as the application to believers today, demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview."
