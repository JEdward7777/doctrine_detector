The Bible portrays God's nature as inherently compassionate and merciful. Several passages illustrate this attribute:

1. **Exodus 34:6-7**: When God reveals Himself to Moses, He describes His nature as "abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin." This emphasizes God’s deep desire to show compassion and forgiveness.

2. **Psalm 103:8-13**: This psalm beautifully expresses God's compassion: "The LORD is gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love... As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him." This imagery highlights the intimate and caring relationship God desires to have with His people.

3. **Isaiah 30:18**: This verse highlights God's longing to be gracious: "Therefore the Lord waits to be gracious to you, and therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you." It illustrates God's proactive stance in seeking to extend His compassion and mercy.

4. **Lamentations 3:22-23**: This poignant passage emphasizes God's compassion in times of suffering: "The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness." It reassures believers that God's compassion is a constant and renewing presence.

5. **Matthew 9:36**: In the New Testament, Jesus embodies God's compassion as seen when He looks at the crowds and has compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. This illustrates how God’s compassion is not only a divine attribute but also actively demonstrated through Christ's ministry.

6. **1 Peter 5:7**: This verse encourages believers to cast their anxieties on God because He cares for them, underscoring the nature of God as a compassionate presence in times of distress. It demonstrates God’s desire to alleviate our burdens and provide comfort.

Overall, the Bible consistently affirms that compassion is a central aspect of God's character, revealing His profound love and care for humanity.
