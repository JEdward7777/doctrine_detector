  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the significance of the term 'call' in the context of God's calling. The student effectively integrates relevant biblical references and theological concepts to support their points, demonstrating a strong understanding of Christian perspectives on God's intentionality, relationship with individuals, empowerment, transformation, and community. The response could benefit from a brief mention of the role of grace in responding to God's call, but overall, it is well-structured and doctrinally sound."
