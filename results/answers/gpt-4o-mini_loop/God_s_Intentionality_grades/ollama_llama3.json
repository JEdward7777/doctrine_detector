  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively highlights the intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity, emphasizing that His call is not random but rather a deliberate invitation for individuals to fulfill a specific role in His divine plan. The writer provides several biblical references to support their points, which adds credibility to their argument.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are:\n\n1. Some of the points made are quite general and do not offer new insights or perspectives on the topic.\n2. The response could benefit from more specific examples of how God's intentional call has impacted individuals throughout history or in contemporary contexts.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern about recognizing the intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity."
