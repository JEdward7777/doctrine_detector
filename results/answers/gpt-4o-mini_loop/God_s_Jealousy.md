## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
When the Bible describes God as "jealous," it is essential to understand the significance of this term within the context of God's nature and character. The term "jealous" signifies God's passionate desire for His people and the intimate relationship He wishes to maintain with them.

In Scripture, particularly in passages such as Exodus 20:5 and Deuteronomy 5:9, God's jealousy is often depicted in relation to idolatry. God earnestly seeks the exclusive devotion of His people, as He is protective of the covenant relationship He has established. Unlike the selfish and resentful jealousy that can be seen in human relationships, God's jealousy is characterized by a righteous zeal for His honor and a deep concern for the well-being of His people.

This understanding highlights God's investment in the faithfulness of His people. His jealousy reflects His commitment to them and His longing for them to remain close in relationship with Him. When individuals turn to idols or other distractions, God's jealousy signifies His yearning for their return and the serious consequences of straying from Him.

Ultimately, God's jealousy embodies His holiness, love, and unwavering commitment to His people, contrasting sharply with human jealousy, which often arises from insecurity or fear. Therefore, the biblical portrayal of God's jealousy can be seen as a powerful expression of His profound love and desire for a covenant relationship with humanity.
