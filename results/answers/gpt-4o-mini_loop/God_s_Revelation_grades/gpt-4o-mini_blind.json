  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate overview of various names and titles through which God introduces Himself in the Bible. The student effectively explains the significance of each name in reflecting different aspects of God's character and relationship with humanity. The inclusion of both Old Testament and New Testament references enhances the depth of the explanation. The connection between each name/title and its corresponding biblical passage helps reinforce the doctrinal understanding of God's attributes and His interaction with His people. Great job!"
