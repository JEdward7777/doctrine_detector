  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed answer highlighting various names and titles of God in the Bible, connecting them to different aspects of His character and relationship with humanity. However, the student could have focused more on the significance of God using His name 'Yahweh' in establishing His identity and covenant relationship with His people, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of how God reveals Himself through His names in the Bible."
