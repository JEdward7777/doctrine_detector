  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of God's role in the process of a person being born again. They effectively incorporate relevant Scriptures and theological concepts to emphasize God's sovereignty and grace in salvation. The only concern is that the student's response could have more explicitly stated that it is ultimately God's work that causes a person to be born again, as indicated in the reference answer from the teacher."
