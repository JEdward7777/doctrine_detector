It draws on key biblical references and articulates the various aspects of God's role in the transformative process of being \"born again\" with clarity and depth. The integration of Scripture and theological insights supports a strong understanding of God's initiation, conviction, regeneration, faith, and ongoing sanctification in the work of salvation."
