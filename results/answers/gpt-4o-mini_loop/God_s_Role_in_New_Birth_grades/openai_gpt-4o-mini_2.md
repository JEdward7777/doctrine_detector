## [Answer](../God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In Christian theology, the concept of being "born again" refers to a profound spiritual transformation that occurs when a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. This term is mainly derived from Jesus' discussion with Nicodemus in John 3:3-7, where He articulates the necessity of being "born again" to enter the Kingdom of God.

God's role in this transformative process is essential and can be outlined in several key aspects:

1. **Initiation of Salvation**: God is the initiator of salvation, as articulated in Ephesians 2:8-9, which emphasizes that salvation is a gift from God, not a product of human effort. This foundational truth highlights God's proactive love in reaching out to humanity.

2. **Conviction of Sin**: The Holy Spirit plays a critical role in leading individuals to recognize their sinfulness and need for redemption, as described in John 16:8-11. This divine conviction prompts awareness of one's need for salvation, encouraging individuals to respond to God's call.

3. **Regeneration**: Being born again involves regeneration, a term that signifies being made spiritually alive through the Holy Spirit's influence. Titus 3:5 mentions that God saves us "through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit," illustrating the Holy Spirit's vital work in transforming a person's heart and mind.

4. **Faith and Response**: While God's role is foundational, individuals must actively exercise faith and consciously choose to accept the gift of salvation. John 1:12 affirms, "Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God," emphasizing the necessity of personal faith in being born again.

5. **Sustaining Grace**: After a person is born again, God's ongoing role includes sanctification, the process of being molded into the likeness of Christ over time. Philippians 1:6 reassures believers that God will continue the good work He began in them until the day of Christ Jesus.

In summary, Godâ€™s role in the process of a person being born again encompasses initiation, conviction, regeneration, the gift of faith, and ongoing sanctification. These elements work harmoniously to bring about the miracle of spiritual rebirth and a transformative journey of faith.
