  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of how the Bible defines godliness, supported by relevant passages. They effectively highlighted the importance of godliness in daily life and actions. However, the student's response could have been more concise and directly addressed how to incorporate godliness into daily life more explicitly. Overall, a commendable effort with room for slight improvement in clarity and focus on practical application."
