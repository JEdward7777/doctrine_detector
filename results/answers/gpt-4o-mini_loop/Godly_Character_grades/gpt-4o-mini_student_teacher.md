9. **Self-control** - The ability to regulate one’s emotions, desires, and actions, particularly in challenging situations, demonstrating strength through submission to God's will.

These attributes reflect the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life, drawing them closer to the character of Christ and enabling them to live out His teachings in everyday life.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the fruits of the Holy Spirit as outlined in Galatians 5:22-23, demonstrating a clear understanding of the characteristics of a godly individual. However, the student included additional characteristics beyond those specified in the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the added details enhance the response, the question specifically asked for the fruits that indicate godly character, and the reference answer only listed six of them. The student demonstrated a strong grasp of the concept but should have aligned the response more closely with the reference answer to fully address the concern.
