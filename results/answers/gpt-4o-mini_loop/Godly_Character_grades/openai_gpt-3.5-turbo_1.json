The use of scriptural references and the emphasis on the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in shaping a believer's character align well with a Christian worldview. However, to achieve a perfect score, it would have been beneficial to reference how these fruits of the Spirit are manifested in the life of a believer as evidence of their cultivation."
