It not only lists the fruits but also explains their significance in reflecting godly character and how they are cultivated through the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life. It effectively addresses the concern by outlining both the characteristics of a godly individual and how to cultivate them according to Christian beliefs. Great job!"
