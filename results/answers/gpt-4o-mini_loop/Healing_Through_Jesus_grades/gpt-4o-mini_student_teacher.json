  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer discussing various aspects of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals. The answer aligns with the Christian worldview by highlighting Jesus' authority over evil spirits, his compassion, personal interaction, emphasis on prayer and faith, public demonstration of power, and teaching moments. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the teacher's answer, which focused on the specific method of 'casting out' demons that Jesus used in healing. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references to support each point would have further strengthened the response."
