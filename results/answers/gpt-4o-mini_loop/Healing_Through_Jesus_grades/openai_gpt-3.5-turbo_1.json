It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' supreme authority over evil spirits, His reliance on prayer and faith, and the compassionate nature of His healing ministry. The response could have further highlighted the importance of the Holy Spirit's role in spiritual warfare, but overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on this topic."
