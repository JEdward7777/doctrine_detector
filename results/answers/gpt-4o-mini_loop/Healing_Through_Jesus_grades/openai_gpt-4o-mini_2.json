It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus's supreme authority over evil spirits and the importance of prayer and faith in the healing process. The only area for slight improvement could be to directly connect the response back to the initial simplistic answer provided, showing how the more detailed explanation enhances and complements the initial understanding."
