## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the New Testament, the practice of anointing is intricately connected to healing, addressing both physical ailments and spiritual needs. Anointing with oil is referenced in several passages and is often linked with prayer and the invocation of God’s healing power.

1. **James 5:14-15**: This passage emphasizes the communal aspect of healing through anointing. It instructs the elders of the church to anoint the sick with oil in the name of the Lord, highlighting a collaborative effort in seeking healing. The verse states, “Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up.” Here, anointing is depicted not merely as a physical remedy but as a vital component of faith-filled prayer, demonstrating the vital connection between spiritual intercession and healing.

2. **Mark 6:13**: This scripture recounts how Jesus’ disciples anointed many sick people with oil as they healed them. This act was part of their mission to extend Christ’s healing ministry, showcasing both the continuation of His work and the faith of the early church in the power of anointing.

3. **Luke 7:46**: In this passage, Jesus comments on a woman who anointed His feet, drawing attention to the act as one of deep love and devotion. While this reference is more ceremonial, it illustrates that anointing transcends mere physical application; it embodies a relational and spiritual significance, expressing worship and recognition of Christ’s authority.

4. **Symbolism of Oil**: Oil in biblical tradition often represents the Holy Spirit, signifying empowerment and healing. Anointing thus serves as a divine act that consecrates and invites God’s presence. The theological implications of anointing extend beyond physical healing; it underscores the holistic nature of God’s healing, integrating body, mind, and spirit, and emphasizing that true healing involves an encounter with the divine.

In summary, anointing in the New Testament is not just a physical treatment but a rich, biblical practice woven with prayer and community support. It acknowledges and invites God’s healing presence, illustrating the profound connection between faith, spiritual intercession, and restorative healing. This holistic perspective reflects the nature of God’s work in our lives, addressing our entire being and encouraging believers to seek His transformative power in their times of need.
