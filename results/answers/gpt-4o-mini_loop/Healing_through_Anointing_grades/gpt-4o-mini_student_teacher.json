  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and in-depth explanation of the practice of anointing related to healing in the New Testament, drawing from various relevant passages and discussing the spiritual significance of anointing. The student effectively highlighted the connection between anointing, prayer, faith, and community support in the context of healing. However, there was some additional theological depth and clarity that could have been added to fully address the concern of recognizing anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice."
