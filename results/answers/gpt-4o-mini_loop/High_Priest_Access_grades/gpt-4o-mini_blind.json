  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of who was allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant and under what circumstances, based on biblical passages. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of the Ark and the importance of maintaining holiness and reverence in approaching it. The inclusion of relevant scriptures enhances the explanation and supports the theological implications. The response could benefit from a brief mention of the Ark's specific contents (tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod, and manna) for a more comprehensive understanding. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound analysis."
