  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of who was allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant and under what circumstances, incorporating relevant biblical references and details. The student effectively highlighted the central role of the High Priest and the significance of the Day of Atonement. The response demonstrated a deep understanding of the importance of holiness, reverence, and purification in approaching the Ark in alignment with Christian teachings. However, it slightly exceeded the given answer by providing additional information beyond the high priest's exclusive access, hence the deduction of 10 points."
