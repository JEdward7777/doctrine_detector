## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a direct response to God's command and the urgency of their situation. The Exodus, recounted in the book of Exodus in the Old Testament, details their escape from slavery in Egypt.

God instructed them to eat unleavened bread as part of the Passover celebration, which commemorated the final plague in Egypt when the firstborn were killed. The key reasons for consuming unleavened bread include:

1. **Urgency of Departure**: The Israelites were commanded to eat bread without yeast because they would not have time to let the dough rise. Exodus 12:34 states, "So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls being bound up in their cloaks on their shoulders." This highlights the immediacy of their exodus.

2. **Symbolic Meaning of Leaven**: In Jewish tradition, leaven often symbolizes sin or corruption, as it can cause dough to rise and become inflated or spoiled. Eating unleavened bread represents not only the haste of their escape but also a call to purity, aligning with the theme of God’s deliverance from sin and bondage. In Exodus 12:17, it says, "And you shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt." This connection draws a powerful parallel between physical liberation and spiritual purity.

3. **Remembrance**: Consuming unleavened bread forms part of a ritual that governs the annual observance of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, enabling the Israelites to remember their deliverance from bondage and God’s faithfulness. This feast serves as a significant reminder of their quick exodus, emphasizing the importance of remembrance in their worship and identity as God’s chosen people.

In summary, the consumption of unleavened bread was both a practical necessity and a profound symbol reflecting the urgency of their escape, while also establishing a tradition of purity and remembrance within Israelite worship.
