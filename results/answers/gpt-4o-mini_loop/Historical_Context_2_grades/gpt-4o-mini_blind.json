  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of why the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt. The student effectively connects the practice to God's command, the urgency of the situation, the symbolic meaning of leaven, and the importance of remembrance. The integration of relevant Bible verses enhances the depth of the explanation. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
