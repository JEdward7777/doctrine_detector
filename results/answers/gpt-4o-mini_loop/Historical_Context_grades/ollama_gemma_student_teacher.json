  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of \"remnant\" in Isaiah and Amos. They provide well-chosen biblical examples that illustrate the idea of God preserving a faithful group amidst judgment and restoration. The response also highlights the importance of remaining steadfast amidst adversity and reinforces the hope of restoration. However, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of the remnant to God's covenant faithfulness."
