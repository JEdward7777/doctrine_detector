The concept of the "remnant" is a profound theme in the prophetic books of Isaiah and Amos, symbolizing the faithful group of people that God preserves even amid judgment and destruction. Here are key biblical events and passages that illustrate this concept:

1. **Isaiah's Declaration of the Remnant**:
   - In Isaiah 10:20-22, after the judgment on Israel through the Assyrian invasion, it is stated that a remnant will return—a remnant of Jacob—to the Mighty God. This passage assures that despite the devastation, God promises that a faithful few will return to Him.
   - Isaiah 11:11-16 speaks of God’s promise to recover a remnant of His people from various nations, showcasing His unwavering commitment to preserve a faithful group who will ultimately restore Israel.

2. **The Faithful in Judah**:
   - During King Hezekiah's reign, many in Judah remained true to Yahweh despite surrounding moral decline and idolatry. This is evident in Isaiah 36-39, where Hezekiah earnestly seeks God's guidance. In response to the Assyrian threat, God preserves both Jerusalem and the faithful remnant within it.

3. **The Call of the Remnant**:
   - In Isaiah 37:31-32, God promises that those who remain in Judah will take root downward and bear fruit upward. This emphasizes that through challenging times, God nurtures His remnant, preparing them for future growth and restoration.

4. **Amos and the Remnant**:
   - In Amos 5:15, the prophet calls for the people to "hate evil and love good," signaling that a remnant must live righteously to escape impending judgment. God's grace allows for the preservation of the righteous even amid widespread corruption.
   - Amos 9:8-10 declares that God will visit judgment upon the sinful kingdom; however, He will not completely destroy the house of Jacob, indicating that a remnant will survive the judgment.

5. **The Exile and Return**:
   - The return of a remnant of the Jewish people to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile (as recorded in books like Ezra and Nehemiah) fulfills the prophetic promises of restoration. This event underscores God's covenant faithfulness and His intention to preserve a faithful remnant to rebuild and restore true worship.

These passages and events from Isaiah and Amos reflect God's unwavering commitment to His people, emphasizing that even during times of judgment, He maintains a faithful remnant to carry His purposes forward. This theme reinforces the hope of restoration and the importance of remaining steadfast amidst adversity.
