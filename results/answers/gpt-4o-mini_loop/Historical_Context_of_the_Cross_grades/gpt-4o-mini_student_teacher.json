  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-developed answer that thoroughly addresses how the Roman practice of crucifixion impacted the perception of the cross in early Christianity. They have effectively outlined the progression from the cross being a symbol of shame and suffering to one of hope, redemption, and victory through the lens of theological transformation. The inclusion of relevant scripture references and the emphasis on the cross as a countercultural symbol further enrich the response. Overall, this response demonstrates a clear understanding of the historical context and theological significance of the cross in early Christianity."
