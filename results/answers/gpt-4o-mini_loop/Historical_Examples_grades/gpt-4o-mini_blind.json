  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and well-structured overview of key individuals in the Bible who built altars and the significance of those acts. The student effectively connects each biblical example to theological themes such as worship, covenant, faithfulness, and divine intervention. The analysis is rich in content and demonstrates a strong understanding of the doctrinal implications of altar-building in the Christian faith. A slight improvement could be made by explicitly connecting the concept of altars to the overarching theme of sacrifice in the Bible, particularly pointing to Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice. Overall, a well-crafted and doctrinally sound response."
