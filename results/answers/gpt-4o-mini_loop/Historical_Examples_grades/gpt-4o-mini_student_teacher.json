  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough response to the question, giving examples of individuals from the Bible who built altars and explaining the significance of these acts in depth. The examples provided show a good understanding of the theological and relational meanings behind building altars in the Bible. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern of inspiring Christians to express their faith and devotion through intentional acts of worship. The student could have linked the examples more explicitly to how modern-day Christians can apply these principles in their own lives."
