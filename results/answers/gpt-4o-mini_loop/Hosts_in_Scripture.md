## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The term "hosts" in scripture is primarily used to describe a multitude or an army, with a predominance in the context of celestial beings, particularly angels. The phrase "Lord of hosts" (or "Yahweh of hosts") serves as a significant title for God throughout the Old Testament, especially in the writings of the prophets, and denotes His sovereignty over both the heavenly armies (angels) and the earthly armies (nations).

1. **Celestial Context**: In passages such as Psalm 103:21 and Isaiah 6:3, "hosts" refers to the heavenly beings serving God. These references underscore God's authority over the spiritual realm, illustrating that He commands these angelic forces for His divine purposes.

2. **Military Context**: The term also encompasses earthly armies or great multitudes, often used metaphorically to express God's power and support in battles. For example, in 1 Samuel 17:45, David declares that he fights in the name of the Lord of hosts against Goliath, highlighting God's backing in physical conflict and the assurance of victory through divine aid.

3. **Literary and Theological Significance**: The notion of "hosts" emphasizes God's omnipotence and control over all creation, reinforcing His ultimate authority. It encapsulates His capability to govern not only the cosmos but also the destinies of nations and the outcomes of their conflicts.

In summary, the term "hosts" in scripture includes both the angelic beings of the heavenly realm and the armies of Israel or other nations, signifying God's supremacy in both spiritual and earthly matters. This understanding deepens our appreciation of God's power and the assurance He provides to His people in their endeavors.
