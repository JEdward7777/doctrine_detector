  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer to the question, demonstrating a solid understanding of the term \"hosts\" in scripture within both celestial and military contexts. They effectively tied in the theological significance of this term in highlighting God's sovereignty and authority. The only improvement could be a clearer reference to the inclusion of celestial bodies like stars and planets when discussing the term \"hosts\" in scripture, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a strong response that aligns with a Christian worldview perspective on spiritual warfare and divine authority."
