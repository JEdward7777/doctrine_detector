Additionally, the connection between the term and God's omnipotence is well articulated. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the connection between spiritual warfare and divine authority as it relates to the concept of \"hosts.\" Including a brief discussion of relevant scriptures concerning spiritual battles would enhance the overall depth of the response."
