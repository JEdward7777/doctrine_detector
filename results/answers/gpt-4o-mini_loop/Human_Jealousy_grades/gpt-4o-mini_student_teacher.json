  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-rounded response to addressing feelings of jealousy in relationships from a Christian perspective. They incorporated Biblical principles and practical steps to handle jealousy constructively. However, the response could have more directly aligned with the teacher's reference answer by emphasizing the importance of using jealousy as a signal to evaluate relationship health and focusing on open communication and trust. The student's answer was comprehensive, but could have been more concise and directly addressed the concern provided."
