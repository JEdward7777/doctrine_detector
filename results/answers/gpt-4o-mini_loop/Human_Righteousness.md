## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In Christian theology, a person is declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. This concept is primarily derived from several key passages in the New Testament, particularly the writings of the Apostle Paul.

1. **Faith in Christ**: Central to Christian belief is the understanding that righteousness is not achieved through personal merit or adherence to the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. Romans 3:22 states, "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."

2. **Grace**: The doctrine of grace underscores that righteousness is a gift from God. Ephesians 2:8-9 emphasizes that salvation and righteousness come through grace and not by works, stating, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."

3. **Justification**: The process of being declared righteous is known as justification. Romans 5:1 teaches, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

4. **Imputed Righteousness**: A crucial aspect of justification is the doctrine of imputed righteousness, which means that Christ's righteousness is credited to believers. This is eloquently expressed in 2 Corinthians 5:21, which states, "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." This signifies that when believers put their faith in Christ, they receive His righteousness as if it were their own.

5. **The Role of Christ's Sacrifice**: Christians believe that Jesus' death and resurrection provide the foundation for this justification. His sacrifice pays the penalty for sin, allowing believers to be seen as righteous before God.

In summary, according to the Christian faith, a person is declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ, facilitated by God's grace, grounded in the redemptive work of Christ on the cross, and characterized by the imputed righteousness of Christ to the believer. This understanding emphasizes the gift of salvation rather than human effort.
