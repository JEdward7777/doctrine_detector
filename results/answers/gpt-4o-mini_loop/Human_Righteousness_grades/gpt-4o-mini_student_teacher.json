  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 95. \n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of how a person is declared righteous according to the Christian faith, focusing on key biblical passages and theological concepts. The answer effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the central role of faith in Jesus Christ, God's grace, justification, imputed righteousness, and Christ's sacrifice. The writing is clear, well-structured, and demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian doctrine related to righteousness."
