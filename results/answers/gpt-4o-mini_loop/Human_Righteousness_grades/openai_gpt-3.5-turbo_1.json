  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the concept of being declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ in Christian theology. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the key components of faith, grace, justification, imputed righteousness, and the role of Christ's sacrifice in this process. The response is thorough, clear, and aligns well with Christian teachings on salvation and human righteousness."
