  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and clear explanation of how a person is declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ within a Christian worldview. It effectively addresses the concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness in relation to faith in Jesus. The inclusion of key theological concepts such as grace, justification, and imputed righteousness from relevant biblical passages demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian beliefs regarding salvation. The response could potentially benefit from a more direct connection to the specific wording of the concern to further enhance clarity."
