It effectively addresses the concern by clearly articulating the foundational role of trusting in Jesus for salvation and how God attributes Christ's righteousness to believers. The response aligns well with Christian teachings and presents a thorough understanding of the basis for human righteousness in relation to faith in Jesus."
