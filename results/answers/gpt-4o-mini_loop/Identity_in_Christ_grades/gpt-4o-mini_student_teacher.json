  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of what it means when God says, \"I have called you by name,\" within the context of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. The answer effectively breaks down the significance of this statement in terms of personal relationship, divine purpose, reassurance, identity, belonging, and call to action, all rooted in biblical references. The student went above and beyond the reference answer by exploring different aspects and implications of being called by name by God. Great job in providing a well-rounded and spiritually grounded response."
