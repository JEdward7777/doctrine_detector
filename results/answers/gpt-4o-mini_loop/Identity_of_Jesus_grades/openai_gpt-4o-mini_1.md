## [Answer](../Identity_of_Jesus.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The name "Jesus" is derived from the Hebrew name "Yeshua," which translates to "Yahweh is salvation" or "the Lord saves." This meaning is profoundly significant, as it encapsulates the central mission of Jesus Christ within Christian faith: to offer salvation to humanity from sin and its consequences.

In the New Testament, specifically in Matthew 1:21, an angel instructs Joseph to name Maryâ€™s son Jesus "because he will save his people from their sins." This emphasizes the redemptive purpose of His life and ministry. Through His sacrificial death and triumphant resurrection, Jesus provided a pathway for reconciliation between humanity and God, fulfilling the prophetic expectations of a Messiah who brings salvation.

Consequently, the name "Jesus" not only identifies Him but also highlights His divine purpose as Savior and Redeemer, underscoring God's initiative to restore and redeem His creation. This deeply rooted understanding of His name encourages believers to embrace the hope and salvation that Jesus embodies.
