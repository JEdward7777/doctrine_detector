  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a **90**.\n\nDespite the length and thoroughness of the response, the student effectively links specific biblical examples to illustrating the consequences of idolatry among God's people. The analysis of key narratives, mention of the prophets' warnings, and exploration of New Testament teachings demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic and its implications for Christians. The answer successfully aligns with the concern provided and presents a comprehensive overview of the seriousness of straying from God's commandments. Great job capturing the gravity of idolatry in Christian theology and offering relevant scriptural references."
