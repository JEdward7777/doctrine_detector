  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive answer explaining the importance of proclaiming the 'good news' for Christians, supporting their points with Biblical references. However, the student's response may be considered slightly excessive in elaboration, as the core concern of recognizing the mandate of Christians to spread the Gospel message could have been addressed more directly and concisely. The student could have focused more on the immediacy and obedience aspect of sharing the Gospel, aligning it closely with Jesus' explicit instruction before His ascension."
