  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and coherent analysis of the roles that the Sadducees and Pharisees played in the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion. The student effectively connects their actions to their character traits, highlighting themes such as self-preservation, spiritual blindness, religious rigor, and political pragmatism. The integration of scripture references adds depth to the analysis and aligns well with a Christian worldview. Well done."
