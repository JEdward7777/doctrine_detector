  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the influence of the Sadducees and Pharisees in the decision to crucify Jesus, highlighting their motivations, character traits, and the broader implications for faith. The response effectively integrates scriptural references and theological reflections to support the arguments presented. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the teacher's reference answer noting the selfishness and hypocrisy of the religious leaders, aligning the student's explanation more closely with the specific concern provided. Overall, a well-developed and thought-provoking response from a Christian worldview."
