## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
According to the Bible, inheriting eternal life is fundamentally rooted in faith in Jesus Christ, coupled with a transformation that reflects that faith in one's actions and obedience. Here are some key points from Scripture that outline the pathway to eternal life:

1. **Centrality of Faith in Jesus**: John 3:16 declares, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This verse emphasizes that faith in Jesus is the essential, foundational element for salvation.

2. **Repentance**: Acts 2:38 illustrates the importance of repentance: "Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'" Repentance signifies a sincere turning away from sin and a commitment to a new life in Christ.

3. **Obedience to God's Commandments**: In Matthew 19:16-17, when a young man inquires about obtaining eternal life, Jesus responds, "If you want to enter life, keep the commandments." This indicates that while faith is critical, living in obedience to God's commandments is a response to that faith, demonstrating its authenticity.

4. **Living a Life of Love**: Jesus articulates the greatest commandments in Matthew 22:37-40, teaching that we must love God and love our neighbor. Genuine love, reflected in our actions, is a vital expression of our faith.

5. **Grace as the Basis for Salvation**: Ephesians 2:8-9 affirms that eternal life is a gift of grace: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast." This highlights that salvation is not earned through works but is a gracious gift from God received through faith.

In summary, the Bible teaches that to inherit eternal life, one must place their faith in Jesus Christ, genuinely repent of sin, live according to God's commandments, and express the love that flows from a heart transformed by faith—all of which acknowledges that this gift of eternal life is ultimately given by God's grace.
