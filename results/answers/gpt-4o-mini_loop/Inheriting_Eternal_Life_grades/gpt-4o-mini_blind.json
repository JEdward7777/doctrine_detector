The inclusion of relevant scriptural references and explanations demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian beliefs on the topic. However, one minor area for improvement could be further emphasizing the exclusive role of faith in Jesus Christ as the sole means of salvation, and how good works flow from that faith rather than being a requirement for salvation."
