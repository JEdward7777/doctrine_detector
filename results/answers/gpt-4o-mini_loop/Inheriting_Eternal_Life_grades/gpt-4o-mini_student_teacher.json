  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus, repentance, obedience to God's commandments, living a life of love, and the role of grace in salvation. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses strengthens the response. However, the student could have directly referenced the answer provided by Jesus in the teacher's reference to more explicitly link their response to the biblical teachings on inheriting eternal life."
