  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported response that integrates biblical references effectively to address the ways in which our responses to God impact His will for our lives. The student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on the interplay between free will, divine sovereignty, and God's unique purpose for individuals. The inclusion of specific examples from the Bible and the clear connection to key Christian teachings enhance the strength of the response. While the student's answer expands upon the reference answer by addressing additional angles and providing more in-depth exploration, it aligns closely with a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern presented. Great job!"
