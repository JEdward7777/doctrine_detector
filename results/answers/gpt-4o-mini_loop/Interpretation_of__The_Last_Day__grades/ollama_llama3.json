  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does touch on some aspects related to judgment, it largely focuses on other aspects of \"the last day\" such as Christ's return, resurrection, and restoration. The concern about understanding judgment is only vaguely addressed, and the main point of the original answer (\"The last day' refers to the final day of judgment upon those who have turned away from God.\") is not adequately covered.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to expand on the importance of understanding judgment in one's relationship with God and the urgency of faith. The writer could also explore how \"the last day\" relates specifically to the concept of judgment, rather than just touching on it briefly. Overall, while the response has some good points, it falls short in fully addressing the concern about understanding judgment."
