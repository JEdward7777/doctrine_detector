  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how 'divine glory' can be understood in the context of worship from a Christian perspective. The answer covers various key aspects such as recognizing God's nature, manifestation in creation, presence in worship, transformational experiences, eschatological hope, and the call to proclaim God's glory. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses and examples enhances the clarity and depth of the response.\n\nOne area for improvement could be to include more direct references to specific theological doctrines or teachings that relate to divine glory in the context of worship. Overall, this is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
