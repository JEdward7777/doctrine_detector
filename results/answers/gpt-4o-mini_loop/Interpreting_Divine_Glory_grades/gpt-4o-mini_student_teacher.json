  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the understanding of divine glory in the context of worship. They elaborated on various key aspects related to recognizing and experiencing God's glory in worship practices. The connection made between divine glory and transformational experiences, eschatological hope, and the call to proclaim God's glory was insightful and aligned with a Christian worldview. However, the answer could have been more succinct and focused specifically on the core essence of divine glory as described in the teacher's reference answer."
