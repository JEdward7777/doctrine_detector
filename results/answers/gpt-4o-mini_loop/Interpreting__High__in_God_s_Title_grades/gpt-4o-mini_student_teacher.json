  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out explanation of the term \"Most High\" in relation to God's nature, showcasing a deep understanding of theological concepts. They effectively highlighted the theological meanings of supremacy, sovereignty, transcendence, holiness, and reverence associated with this title. However, the response could have been improved by aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer, which emphasized that \"high\" refers to greatness and authority rather than physical height. This minor deviation slightly detracts from the overall accuracy of the interpretation."
