## [Answer](../Israel_s_Identity.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The name 'Israel' has profound biblical origins, primarily found in the narrative of Genesis. It was given to the patriarch Jacob after he wrestled with a divine being at Peniel. In Genesis 32:28, God changes Jacob's name to Israel, which is commonly interpreted to mean "he who struggles with God" or "God contends." This event not only highlights Jacob's literal wrestling match but also symbolizes the ongoing struggles and relationship between God and His people.

In a broader biblical context, 'Israel' refers not only to Jacob himself but also to the entire nation of his descendants, known as the Israelites. Throughout the Scriptures, Israel encompasses the physical lineage of the Jewish people and, in a spiritual sense, can signify the people of God as a whole, including the church in the New Testament era.

Thus, the name 'Israel' encapsulates essential themes of struggle, identity, and covenant relationship with God, illustrating the depth and complexity of human interaction with the divine throughout biblical history.
