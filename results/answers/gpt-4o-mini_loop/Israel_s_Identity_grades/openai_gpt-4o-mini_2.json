The inclusion of Jacob's personal struggle with God, the collective identity of the Israelites, and the spiritual application of 'Israel' to the people of God showcases a deep understanding of the biblical theme of wrestling with God. The response demonstrates a solid grasp of the significance of biblical names and their meanings within a Christian worldview."
