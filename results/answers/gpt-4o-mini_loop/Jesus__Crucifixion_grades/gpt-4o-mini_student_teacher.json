  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of the offer of wine mixed with myrrh to Jesus on the cross. They effectively addressed the significance of the gesture in terms of suffering, fulfillment of prophecy, Jesus' rejection of the offer, and the theological implications. The response demonstrated a deep understanding of Christian theology and portrayed Jesus' refusal as a reflection of his commitment to his sacrificial mission. Overall, the student's answer was well-structured, supported by relevant scriptural references, and offered a comprehensive perspective on the topic. Great job on connecting the event to broader theological themes."
