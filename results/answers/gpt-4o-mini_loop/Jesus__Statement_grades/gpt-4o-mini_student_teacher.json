  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as a 90.\n\nThe student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of Jesus' statement as \"the Resurrection and the Life,\" delving into the theological implications of His words and the significance for believers. The answer effectively highlighted the authority of Jesus over death, the promise of eternal life through Him, and the necessity of faith for salvation. Additionally, the student connected the statement to the context of Martha's conversation and Jesus' ultimate victory over death through His resurrection.\n\nThe student's response demonstrated a solid understanding of Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, addressing the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in theological understanding effectively. The only reason for deducting a few points could be the lack of some direct biblical references to support their points, which could have strengthened their argument even further. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful response."
