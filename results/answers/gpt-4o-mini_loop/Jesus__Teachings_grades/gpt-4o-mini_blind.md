## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the New Testament, Jesus often used the term "amen" to emphasize the truth and authority of His teachings. The word "amen," derived from Hebrew, means "truly" or "surely," serving as an affirmation of the statements that follow.

One of the most notable ways Jesus utilized "amen" is through the phrase "Truly, truly, I say to you," which appears frequently in the Gospel of John (e.g., John 3:3; John 5:24). This repetition of "truly" indicates a strong emphasis on the importance and truthfulness of His words. For instance, in John 10:7, Jesus states, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.” Here, He emphasizes that His role as the shepherd and the way to salvation is profoundly significant.

Additionally, in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:18, 5:20), Jesus employs "amen" to underscore God's law's inviolability and the righteousness expected from His followers. When He says, "For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished," He highlights the certainty and divine authority behind the teachings He imparts.

Furthermore, in the context of prayer, Jesus mentions in Matthew 6:6, “But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.” By beginning His statements with "amen," He invites listeners to consider the importance of sincere communication with God.

Overall, through the use of "amen," Jesus communicates not only affirmation but also the authority of His message, inviting His listeners to genuinely reflect on and respond to His teachings with reverence and commitment.
