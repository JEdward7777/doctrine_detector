  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a strong understanding of how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings, providing detailed examples from Scripture. The student effectively explained the significance and emphasis placed on Jesus' words and teachings through the use of \"amen.\" However, the student could have made a more direct connection to recognizing the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture as specified in the concern. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
