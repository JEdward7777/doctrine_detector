  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, as it mentions how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize the truth and authority of His teachings. The response also provides specific examples from the Bible, such as John 3:3 and Matthew 5:18, which illustrates Jesus' use of \"amen\" to underscore the importance and certainty of His words.\n\nHowever, while the response does touch on the theme of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings, it could be strengthened by providing more explicit connections between Jesus' use of \"amen\" and the recognition of His authority. For example, the response could elaborate on how Jesus' use of \"amen\" serves as a reminder to listeners of the divine origin and authority behind His teachings.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some good insights into Jesus' use of \"amen,\" it could be further developed to more explicitly address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture."
