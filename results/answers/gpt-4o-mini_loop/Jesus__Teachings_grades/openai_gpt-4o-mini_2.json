  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response accurately explains how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize the truth and authority of His teachings in Scripture. The student effectively connects Jesus' repetitive use of \"Truly, truly, I say to you\" with His authoritative teachings and highlights the importance of sincerity in prayer. The explanation aligns well with recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture from a Christian worldview. Well done!"
