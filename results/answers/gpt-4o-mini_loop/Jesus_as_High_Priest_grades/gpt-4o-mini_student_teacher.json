  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive explanation of Jesus' role as our High Priest and how it impacts the sacrifices made by human priests. They effectively referenced relevant Bible verses and demonstrated a strong understanding of the significance of Jesus' sacrifice. The only area for improvement could be to further emphasize the unique and ultimate nature of Jesus' sacrifice in comparison to those made by human priests in the Old Testament."
