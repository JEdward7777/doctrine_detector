  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of how Jesus is described in relation to the high priesthood in the New Testament, particularly focusing on the book of Hebrews. The answer thoroughly discusses key points such as Jesus being after the order of Melchizedek, His perfection as a high priest, His role as the mediator of a new covenant, His sacrificial offering, and His ongoing intercessory work. The answer could have been further strengthened by including references to Jesus' eternal priesthood and His position at the right hand of God. Overall, a solid explanation with doctrinal correctness."
