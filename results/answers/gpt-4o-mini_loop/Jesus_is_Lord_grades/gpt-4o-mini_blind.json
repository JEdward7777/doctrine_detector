  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: This answer effectively emphasizes the unique significance of Jesus as Lord in contrast to political leaders. The student provides insightful ways to differentiate and clarify the theological implications of declaring \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where earthly leaders may also be referred to as \"lord.\" The use of historical context and theological emphasis enriches the response, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The only improvement could be to expand further on the eternal and spiritual implications of Jesus' lordship over all aspects of life."
