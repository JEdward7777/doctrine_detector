  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of differentiating Jesus' divine lordship from earthly titles by providing multiple approaches to convey this message, including clarifying the meaning, highlighting contextual differences, providing historical context, using specific titles, and emphasizing theological aspects. While not identical to the original answer, it provides a comprehensive explanation that covers the significance of Jesus being Lord in various ways, which aligns with the concern for clarity. The response's overall structure and organization are also well-done, making it easy to follow and understand. To reach a perfect score, the response could have provided more explicit connections between its different approaches or directly addressed potential counterarguments. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively addresses the concern for clarity."
