The suggestions offered demonstrate a deep understanding of the theological implications behind declaring \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also referred to as \"lord.\" The response effectively emphasizes the unique significance of Jesus' lordship and highlights the importance of recognizing His authority as distinct from and superior to any earthly ruler."
