  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80.\n\nThe student has demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of respecting both theological perspectives in translating \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context. The approach suggested by the student is respectful and informative, highlighting the differences in belief while maintaining clarity and sensitivity. However, the answer could be improved by maintaining the original terminology as recommended by the reference answer from the teacher. It is important to uphold Biblical accuracy and clarity in conveying the meaning of the original text."
