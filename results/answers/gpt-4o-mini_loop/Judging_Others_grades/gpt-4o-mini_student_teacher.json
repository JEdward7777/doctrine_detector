  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive overview of key scriptural instructions on how Christians should judge each other, they could have included a more direct emphasis on the importance of not judging harshly or condemning one another, as specifically highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher. By incorporating this central theme more prominently into their explanation, the student could have aligned their response even more closely with the provided concern of learning how to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the Biblical principles related to judging others within a Christian context, but missed the mark slightly in fully emphasizing the importance of avoiding harsh judgment and condemnation in line with the specified concern."
