  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively incorporates the provided scriptural instructions on how Christians should judge each other in a Christ-like manner, emphasizing love, humility, and restoration. It demonstrates a solid understanding of biblical principles related to this topic and provides a comprehensive overview of key passages. The explanation is clear, well-structured, and aligns well with a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be providing more direct references to passages supporting the idea of encouraging and supporting one another as mentioned in the initial answer."
