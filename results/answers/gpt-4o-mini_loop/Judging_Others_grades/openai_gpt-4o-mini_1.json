  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how Christians should judge each other based on key biblical principles, focusing on love, humility, restoration, and gentleness. It draws from a variety of relevant Scriptures to support the points made, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The only area for improvement could be to provide more explicit integration of the specific concern related to approaching relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner, but overall, the response effectively addresses the concern with sound theological insights."
