  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer from a biblical perspective on the judgment day, highlighting key biblical passages and principles related to faith, repentance, works, and divine justice. The response effectively emphasized the importance of aligning one's actions with their faith in Jesus Christ. However, the student could have more explicitly emphasized the core aspect of individuals being judged based on their alignment with the righteous character of Christ, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the answer demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical teachings on judgment day."
