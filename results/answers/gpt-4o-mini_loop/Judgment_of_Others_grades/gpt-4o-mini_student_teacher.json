  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 85.\n\nThe student demonstrated a solid understanding of the importance of self-examination and humility before criticizing others, referencing both Matthew 7:1-5 and Galatians 6:1 to support their points. The student's explanation was thorough and well-supported, showing a strong grasp of the Christian teaching on addressing faults in others in relation to our own faults. However, the response could have been more concise and focused directly on the specific teaching from Jesus in Luke 6:41-42, as provided in the reference answer."
