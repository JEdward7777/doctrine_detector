  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively integrates teachings from Matthew 7:1-5 and Galatians 6:1 to emphasize the importance of self-examination and humility before correcting others. The inclusion of additional Bible verses enhances the depth of the response. It aligns well with the concern about avoiding hypocrisy and maintaining a strong Christian witness. Overall, a strong explanation with a solid connection to a Christian worldview."
