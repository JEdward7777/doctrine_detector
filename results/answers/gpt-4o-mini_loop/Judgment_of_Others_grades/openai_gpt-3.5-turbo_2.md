## [Answer](../Judgment_of_Others.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Jesus teaches us about the significance of self-examination before addressing the faults of others, particularly in Matthew 7:1-5. In this passage from the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus warns against judging others while being oblivious to our own shortcomings. He illustrates this with the metaphor of someone who notices a speck in a brotherâ€™s eye while ignoring the plank in their own eye.

The essential lesson here is that we should first confront our own sins and imperfections before attempting to correct or judge others. This teaching calls for humility and self-reflection, as it encourages us to avoid hypocrisy. Rather than quickly criticizing others, Jesus invites us to pursue personal growth and repentance. When we do this, we may be better equipped to help others with genuine compassion and understanding.

Additionally, Galatians 6:1 provides further guidance by stating that if someone is caught in a sin, those who are spiritual should gently restore them, while being cautious of their own vulnerabilities. This passage reinforces the notion that we should remain mindful of our own faults and limitations in our interactions with others.

In conclusion, Jesus instructs us to prioritize our own faults before addressing those of others, cultivating an attitude of humility and genuine care in our relationships.
