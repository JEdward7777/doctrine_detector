  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a well-articulated explanation of the significance of self-examination before addressing the faults of others, drawing on relevant biblical passages to support the argument. The essay effectively addresses the concern of hypocrisy in judging others without considering one's own faults, aligning with a Christian worldview that values humility and genuine care in relationships. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate a direct reference to Matthew 7:1-5 in addition to Luke 6:41-42 to strengthen the argument further."
