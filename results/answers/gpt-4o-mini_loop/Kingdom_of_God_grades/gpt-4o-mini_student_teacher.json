  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided thoughtful insights and suggestions for translating the term \"Kingdom of God\" while balancing cultural relevance and theological integrity. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of maintaining the deep biblical context of the term. However, the teacher's specific concern was to retain the term 'Kingdom of God' and provide explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance, which the student did not fully adhere to. There is room for improvement by aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
