The suggestions offered, such as conceptual translation, metaphorical language, and theological explanation, demonstrate a understanding of the importance of maintaining the theological integrity of the phrase while making it culturally relevant. The emphasis on engaging local believers and indigenous language experts in the translation process also shows a commitment to honoring both the cultural context and the biblical implications of the \"Kingdom of God\"."
