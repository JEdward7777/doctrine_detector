  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a well-thought-out and comprehensive approach to addressing the concern raised. It effectively retains the term \"Kingdom of God\" while incorporating ways to explain its spiritual and eschatological significance to a culture unfamiliar with the concept of kingdoms. The suggested strategies maintain the depth and biblical context of the term, ensuring that the theological integrity is preserved. The emphasis on engaging local believers and language experts is particularly commendable, as it ensures that the translation process respects both the cultural nuances and the rich theological implications of the term. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong Christian worldview perspective in addressing the concern."
