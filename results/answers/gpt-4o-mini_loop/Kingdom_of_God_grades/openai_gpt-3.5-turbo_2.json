  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides thoughtful and culturally sensitive approaches to translating the term \"Kingdom of God\" while maintaining its theological integrity. The emphasis on retaining the original term and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance effectively addresses the concern that rephrasing could potentially dilute the depth and biblical context of the term. The suggestions for conceptual translation, metaphorical language, and theological explanation are well-founded and demonstrate a commitment to preserving the essence of the term 'Kingdom of God' in the translation process. Overall, this response is comprehensive and balanced in its approach."
