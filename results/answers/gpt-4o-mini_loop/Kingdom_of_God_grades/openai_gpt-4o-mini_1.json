It suggests maintaining the original term while also incorporating explanations to ensure understanding of its spiritual and eschatological significance. The proposed strategies for conceptual translation, metaphorical language, and theological explanation are solid and demonstrate a thoughtful consideration of both the cultural relevance and theological integrity of the term. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern raised while offering practical steps for successful translation."
