Retaining the term and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance is important, and the suggested strategies of conceptual translation, metaphorical language, and theological explanation are insightful ways to achieve this while ensuring cultural relevance. Engaging local believers and indigenous language experts is also highlighted as crucial for accurate and meaningful translation. Overall, the response effectively balances preserving the biblical richness of the term with the need for cultural understanding and clarity."
