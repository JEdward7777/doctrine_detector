  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-supported answer that delves into theological, contextual, and cultural reasons for retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the book of Matthew. Their response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the unique significance of this term in conveying the eschatological essence of Jesus' teachings in Matthew's Gospel. The student's analysis is thorough and demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological implications and implications for biblical interpretation. Great job!"
