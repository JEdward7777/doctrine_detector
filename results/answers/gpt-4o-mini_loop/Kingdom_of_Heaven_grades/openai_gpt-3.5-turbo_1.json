The explanation is thorough, weaving in biblical context, distinctive identity, theological implications, connection to Jesus' teachings, ecclesiological significance, and cultural resonance. The response effectively addresses the concern by illustrating how understanding the unique terminology enriches our grasp of the intended message of the biblical authors. It provides a well-rounded analysis with strong scriptural support and a solid Christian worldview perspective."
