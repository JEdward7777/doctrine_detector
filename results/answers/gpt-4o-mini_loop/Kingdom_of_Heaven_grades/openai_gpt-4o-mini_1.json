  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and well-reasoned explanation for retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the book of Matthew, addressing various theological, contextual, and cultural aspects. It effectively connects the unique terminology used in Matthew's gospel to the intended theological messages of the biblical author. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of how language choice impacts theological interpretation within a Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how the term \"heaven\" directly relates to the concept of God's reign and the uniqueness of Matthew's theological emphasis."
