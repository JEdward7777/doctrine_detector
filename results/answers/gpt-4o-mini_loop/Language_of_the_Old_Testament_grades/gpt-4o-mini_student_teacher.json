  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate answer, demonstrating knowledge of the primary language of the Old Testament as Hebrew. The additional information about Aramaic sections in Daniel and Ezra shows extra understanding, although not necessary for the question at hand. Overall, well done in addressing the concern and providing relevant information."
