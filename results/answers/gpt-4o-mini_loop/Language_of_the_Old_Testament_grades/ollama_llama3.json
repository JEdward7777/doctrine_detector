  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately states that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which aligns with the correct answer. Additionally, it provides some nuance by mentioning Aramaic texts in specific books, which adds context to the original statement. However, I deduct points because the response doesn't explicitly state the significance of knowing this information for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context, which is the specified concern.\n\nThe comment: While the response provides some accurate information about the languages used in the Old Testament, it would be even more effective if it had explicitly highlighted the importance of this knowledge for biblical study."
