## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the New Testament, particularly in the letters of Paul and the Acts of the Apostles, we observe that early believers typically met in various settings, with their gatherings characterized by specific practices and purposes rooted in their faith in Christ.

1. **Home Gatherings**: Early Christians predominantly met in homes, as church buildings did not exist in the initial years of the church. For instance, Lydia hosted believers in her home in Philippi (Acts 16:15), and Philemon opened his house for gatherings (Philemon 1:2). These intimate settings allowed for deep relationships and discipleship.

2. **Teaching and Fellowship**: The gatherings included teaching, prayer, the breaking of bread (communion), and fellowship. Acts 2:42 notes that the early church devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, fellowship, the breaking of bread, and prayer, highlighting the importance of spiritual nourishment and community support.

3. **Public Worship**: In larger cities, believers also assembled in public venues like synagogues or the temple (Acts 3:1; Acts 13:5), especially during the early years when they were still closely associated with Judaism. This provided an opportunity for outreach as they shared the message of Christ with a broader audience.

4. **Worship and Prayer**: Their meetings were marked by collective forms of worship, including singing, praying, and sharing testimonies of faith (Colossians 3:16). These activities were expressions of their love for God and one another, serving to strengthen communal bonds.

5. **Caring for One Another**: Gatherings also served as platforms for mutual support and care. Acts 2:44-45 illustrates how believers shared their possessions and resources, offering ministry to the poor and addressing each other's spiritual and physical needs as a reflection of Christ's love.

The gatherings of early believers were fundamentally centered on Christ, focused on growing in faith, encouraging one another, and advancing the Gospel. This communal aspect not only reflected their devotion to God but also fulfilled Jesus' command to love one another (John 13:34-35), showcasing the theological significance of the church as the Body of Christ.
