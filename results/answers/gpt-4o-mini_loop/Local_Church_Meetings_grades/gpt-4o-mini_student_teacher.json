  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-detailed and comprehensive overview of how early believers typically met, including various settings, practices, and purposes rooted in their faith. They effectively highlighted the importance of fellowship, teaching, worship, caring for one another, and the communal aspect centered on Christ. The response aligns with the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers, although it could have directly addressed the specific setting of believers meeting in someone's home mentioned in the reference answer to further strengthen the connection with the question."
