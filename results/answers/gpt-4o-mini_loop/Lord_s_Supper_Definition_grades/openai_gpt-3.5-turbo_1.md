During this meal, Jesus instituted the practice by breaking bread and sharing wine, signifying His body and blood, which would be given for the forgiveness of sins. This event holds profound theological significance as it represents Jesus’ sacrificial death, the establishment of a new covenant with believers, and the ongoing act of remembering His sacrifice until His return.
