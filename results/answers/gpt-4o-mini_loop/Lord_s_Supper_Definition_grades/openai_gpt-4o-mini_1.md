## [Answer](../Lord_s_Supper_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist, commemorates the Last Supper that Jesus shared with His disciples before His crucifixion. During this meal, Jesus instituted the practice by breaking bread and sharing wine, signifying His body and blood, which would be given for the forgiveness of sins. This event holds profound theological significance as it represents Jesus’ sacrificial death, the establishment of a new covenant with believers, and the ongoing act of remembering His sacrifice until His return. It emphasizes key themes of redemption, the unity of the church community, and the love that binds believers together in Christ. Through the Lord's Supper, Christians partake in a sacred act of faith and fellowship, reflecting on the grace received and the hope of eternal life through Jesus.
