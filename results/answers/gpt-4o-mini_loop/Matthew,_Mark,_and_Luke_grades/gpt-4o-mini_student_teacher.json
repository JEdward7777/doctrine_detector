  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate answer by referencing key passages in the New Testament where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. The concern regarding familiarity with the Gospel accounts and their teachings is evident in the student's response. However, the student could have aligned their answer more closely with the reference answer provided by specifically mentioning the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke in their initial response. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
