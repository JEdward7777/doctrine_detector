  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the three main books in which the names of the twelve disciples are listed, namely Matthew, Mark, and Luke. However, it lacks specific details about the passages mentioned in each book, which would have made it more comprehensive. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a basic understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings, which is reflected in the score.\n\nThe concern \"Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings\" is partially met by the response, as it shows some awareness of the key texts where the names of the disciples are listed. However, a higher grade would have required more specific information about the passages mentioned, such as the exact references to Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:13-16, and Acts 1:13, which are not provided in this response."
