## Question [Matthew, Mark, and Luke](../../../questions/Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md)
In which books of the Bible are the names of the twelve disciples listed?

## Correct Answer
The names of the twelve disciples are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

## Stated Concern
Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings.

## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The names of the twelve disciples are listed in several key passages in the New Testament. The primary references are:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage gives a comprehensive list of the twelve apostles.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - Here, we find another account listing the twelve apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - This verse includes the names of the apostles as well.
4. **Acts 1:13** - Following the ascension of Jesus, this passage mentions the apostles.

These listings provide the names of the twelve disciples whom Jesus chose to be His closest followers. While the order of names may differ slightly among the passages, they all identify the same key figures who played a crucial role in the ministry of Jesus.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately identifies the three main books in which the names of the twelve disciples are listed, namely Matthew, Mark, and Luke. However, it lacks specific details about the passages mentioned in each book, which would have made it more comprehensive. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a basic understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings, which is reflected in the score.

The concern "Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings" is partially met by the response, as it shows some awareness of the key texts where the names of the disciples are listed. However, a higher grade would have required more specific information about the passages mentioned, such as the exact references to Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:13-16, and Acts 1:13, which are not provided in this response.
