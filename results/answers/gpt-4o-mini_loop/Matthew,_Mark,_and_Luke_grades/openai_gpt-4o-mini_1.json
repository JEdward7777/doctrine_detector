  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies where the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the New Testament (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and Acts). It demonstrates a good understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings by referencing specific passages that mention the disciples. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of direct quotation or paraphrasing from the passages cited in the response. Overall, a well-informed and solid answer with a Christian worldview perspective."
