## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The names of the twelve disciples are listed in several key passages in the New Testament. The primary references are:

1. **Matthew 10:2-4** - This passage gives a comprehensive list of the twelve apostles.
2. **Mark 3:16-19** - Here, we find another account listing the twelve apostles.
3. **Luke 6:13-16** - This verse includes the names of the apostles as well.
4. **Acts 1:13** - Following the ascension of Jesus, this passage mentions the apostles.

These listings provide the names of the twelve disciples whom Jesus chose to be His closest followers. While the order of names may differ slightly among the passages, they all identify the same key figures who played a crucial role in the ministry of Jesus.

It demonstrates a good understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings by referencing specific passages that mention the disciples. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of direct quotation or paraphrasing from the passages cited in the response. Overall, a well-informed and solid answer with a Christian worldview perspective.
