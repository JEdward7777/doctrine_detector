It demonstrates an understanding of the significance of these prophecies in strengthening faith in Jesus as the Messiah. However, it could have been strengthened by including more examples of prophecies fulfilled by Jesus and their fulfillment in the New Testament, as shown in the provided response. Overall, a solid response with room for further elaboration and depth."
