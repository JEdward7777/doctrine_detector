## [Answer](../Messiah.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The term 'Messiah' originates from the Hebrew word "Mashiach," meaning "anointed one." In Christianity, the Messiah is principally understood as Jesus Christ, who Christians believe fulfills prophecies found in the Old Testament, such as Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22, which point to a suffering servant and redeemer. The New Testament further reinforces this belief, particularly in passages like John 1:41, where Jesus is openly recognized as the Messiah.

In the Jewish tradition, the Messiah is anticipated as a future leader from the line of David, based on scriptures like Jeremiah 23:5 and Ezekiel 37:24-25. Jewish expectations often focus on the restoration of Israel, the establishment of global peace, and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. This figure is expected to be a political and spiritual savior who addresses the national hopes of the Jewish community.

Within Islam, the Mahdi is regarded as a messianic figure who will come to restore righteousness before the Day of Judgment. Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is seen as a prophet who will return to assist the Mahdi, according to teachings found in Hadith literature. This perspective differs significantly from the Christian understanding of Jesus as the divine Messiah, as Christians uphold His unique nature as both fully God and fully man (John 1:14).

Thus, while 'Messiah' conveys the idea of an anointed deliverer or savior, the specific expectations surrounding that figure truly vary among these religious contexts. Each tradition reflects its theological teachings, historical backgrounds, and eschatological hopes. Understanding these diverse perspectives allows for meaningful interreligious dialogue and a more profound appreciation of the Messiah concept across faiths.
