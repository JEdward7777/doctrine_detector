  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response offers a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the significance of the title 'King of the Jews' in relation to Jesus' identity as the Messiah. The student effectively connects the concept of Messianic expectation, prophetic fulfillment, the Roman context, universal reign, and the nature of Jesus' spiritual kingdom. The inclusion of relevant biblical references enhances the theological depth of the response. The explanation is clear, coherent, and aligns well with Christian doctrine. Great job overall."
