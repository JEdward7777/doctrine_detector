It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the Messianic expectations, prophetic fulfillment, the Roman context, the universal reign, and the spiritual kingdom aspects of Jesus' kingship. The explanation is thorough, well-supported with biblical references, and demonstrates a deep understanding of Jesus' messianic role within the Christian faith."
