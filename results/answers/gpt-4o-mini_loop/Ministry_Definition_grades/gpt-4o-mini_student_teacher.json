  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that aligns closely with the biblical understanding of ministry. They effectively highlighted key aspects such as service, sharing the Gospel, compassion, encouragement, prayer, spiritual gifts, acts of justice, discipleship, and spiritual growth. The response demonstrates a solid grasp of the biblical principles of ministry and effectively connects them to relevant Scriptures. The student could further improve by providing more direct references to specific verses in the Bible to support each point and by incorporating personal reflections on the importance of understanding and practicing ministry in a Christian worldview."
