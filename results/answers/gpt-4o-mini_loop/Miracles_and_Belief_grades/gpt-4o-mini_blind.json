  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of how miracles function as signs that lead to belief in God from a Christian perspective. The student effectively articulates various aspects of how miracles reveal God's nature, validate messengers, create awe, fulfill prophecies, call for faith, demonstrate the Kingdom, and encourage believers. The references to biblical examples and passages enhance the theological depth of the response. One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the centrality of Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation of God through miracles. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound analysis."
