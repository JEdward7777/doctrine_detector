  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 90. The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of how miracles function as signs that lead to belief in God, addressing multiple aspects such as the revelation of God's nature, validation of messengers, creation of wonder and awe, fulfillment of prophecies, call to faith and repentance, signs of the Kingdom, and encouragement for believers. The answer is thorough and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. Additionally, the response aligns with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the role of miracles in pointing to God's power and presence. Great job!"
