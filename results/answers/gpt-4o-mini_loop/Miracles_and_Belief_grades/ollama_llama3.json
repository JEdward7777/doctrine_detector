  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the role of miracles in leading others to faith, going beyond the initial answer by providing a comprehensive explanation of how miracles serve as signs that lead to belief in God. The writer effectively explores various aspects of miracle-working, including revelation of divine nature, validation of messengers, creation of wonder and awe, fulfillment of prophecies, call to faith and repentance, and encouragement for believers.\n\nThe response is well-organized, with clear transitions between each point, and the language is concise yet precise. The writer also provides scriptural support, citing specific examples from the Bible to illustrate their points. This adds credibility to the response and shows a thoughtful engagement with the biblical text.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are minor: some of the sentences could be shortened or rephrased for greater clarity, and a few points could be more deeply developed. Additionally, while the writer does an excellent job of highlighting the role of miracles in leading others to faith, they could have explored this concern more explicitly throughout the response.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern of understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith and demonstrates a deepened understanding of the biblical concept."
