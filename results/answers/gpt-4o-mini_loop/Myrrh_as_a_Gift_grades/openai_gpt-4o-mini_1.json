It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how understanding the symbolism of myrrh deepens appreciation for Jesus' role as the Messiah who would be sacrificed for humanity's sins. The response is well-reasoned, supported by relevant biblical references, and offers a comprehensive analysis of myrrh's symbolism in relation to Jesus' suffering, death, royalty, humanity, cultural context, and foreshadowing. Overall, a very strong and well-articulated response."
