The student effectively supports their points with relevant Scripture references and articulately conveys the implications of Jesus being the image of God in areas such as revelation, restoration of relationship, modeling for humanity, authority in creation, and the hope of glory. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian doctrine and effectively communicates the profound impact of Jesus being the image of God in Christian faith. Great job!"
