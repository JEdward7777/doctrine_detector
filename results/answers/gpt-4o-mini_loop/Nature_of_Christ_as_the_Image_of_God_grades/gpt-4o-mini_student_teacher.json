  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80. \n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive explanation of how Jesus is described as the image of God in various passages of the New Testament and the significance of this belief in Christian theology. They have correctly highlighted key aspects such as the revelation of God through Jesus, the restoration of relationship between God and humanity, Jesus being a model for humanity, his authority in creation, and the hope of glory for believers.\n\nHowever, the student could have emphasized more explicitly on the divinity of Jesus as the image of God, as the teacher's reference answer states that Jesus is God himself, sharing the same essence with God the Father. Adding this crucial aspect would have strengthened the answer even further."
