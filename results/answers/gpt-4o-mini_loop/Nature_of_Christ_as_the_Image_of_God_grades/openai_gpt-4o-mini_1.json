The incorporation of relevant biblical references and detailed analysis demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological implications of Jesus as the image of God. However, the response slightly deviates from the initial answer by not explicitly stating that Jesus is God himself sharing the same essence with God the Father, which could have further emphasized his divinity and role in salvation."
