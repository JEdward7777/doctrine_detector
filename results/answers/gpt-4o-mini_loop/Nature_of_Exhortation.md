ANSWER:
======
Christians are encouraged to approach exhortation with a mindset rooted in love, humility, and a desire for growth in faith, according to the teachings of the New Testament. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Love is Central**: The foundation for any exhortation should be love. Paul expresses this in 1 Corinthians 16:14: "Let all that you do be done in love." Exhortation should aim to build up the recipient, not to tear them down.

2. **Seeking Restoration**: In Galatians 6:1, believers are urged to gently restore those caught in sin. This passage teaches that when addressing sin, the approach should be characterized by gentleness and humility, recognizing one's own susceptibility to sin.

3. **Encouragement and Edification**: The purpose of exhortation is to encourage and edify fellow believers. In 1 Thessalonians 5:11, Paul writes, "Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing." Exhortation should foster spiritual growth and a sense of community among believers.

4. **Clarity of Truth**: Hebrews 3:13 reminds believers of the importance of encouraging one another daily, to prevent being hardened by sin's deceitfulness. This entails offering uplifting words alongside clear, truthful teaching regarding God’s Word and His will.

5. **Balanced Approach**: Effective exhortation often involves a balance of encouragement and correction. In 2 Timothy 4:2, Paul exhorts Timothy to preach the Word, being prepared in season and out of season; to correct, rebuke, and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction.

6. **Prayerful Attitude**: Exhortation should be enveloped in prayer. Seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit ensures that the words spoken or actions taken align with God’s will and purpose for the individual.

7. **Be Mindful of the Community**: In the context of corporate worship and fellowship, exhortation should positively contribute to the community. Paul states in Ephesians 4:29, “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs.”

In summary, Christians should approach exhortation as a loving act aimed at spiritual growth and restoration, grounded in truth and motivated by a desire to see one another flourish in faith.
