  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament. They have appropriately highlighted the importance of love, restoration, encouragement, edification, truth, a balanced approach, prayerful attitude, and mindfulness of the community. Their response is comprehensive and aligns well with the reference answer from the teacher. The only minor area for improvement would be to explicitly emphasize the importance of avoiding harsh or abrupt exhortation, as mentioned in the reference answer."
