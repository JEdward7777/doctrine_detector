The references to biblical passages, such as the parable of the Prodigal Son and the Lord's Prayer, effectively support the assertions made about God's compassion, mercy, desire for reconciliation, grace, justice, and transformative power. The answer reflects a solid understanding of Christian doctrine concerning forgiveness and the character of God the Father. Great work!"
