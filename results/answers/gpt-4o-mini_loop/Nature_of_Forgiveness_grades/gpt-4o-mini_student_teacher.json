  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of Jesus's teachings about forgiveness and how they reveal the character of God the Father. The answer effectively incorporates key aspects such as compassion, mercy, reconciliation, grace, justice, wrath against sin, and transformative power. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the moral and relational attributes of God as revealed through Jesus's teachings. The connection between forgiveness flowing from our hearts to reflect God's nature of grace and mercy could have been more explicitly highlighted to align closer with the reference answer, hence the slight deduction in grade."
