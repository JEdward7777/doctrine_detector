  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the implications of Jesus' statement that God is Spirit. The student effectively connects this theological truth to various aspects of worship and Christian living. The integration of relevant biblical references strengthens the argument. One recommendation for improvement would be to delve deeper into the implications of God being Spirit on the concept of worship as a whole, perhaps exploring more on the transformative power of worship in spirit and truth. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound analysis."
