  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and thorough examination of the essence of God as Spirit and how this understanding influences worship. It effectively addresses the concern by delving into the nature of God, the immateriality of God, worship in spirit and truth, and the practical implications for believers in their worship practices. The integration of Bible verses and Christian principles strengthens the argument and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
