  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound overview of the nature and experience of hell as described in the Bible. They accurately reference key Scriptures and theological concepts, emphasizing the seriousness of judgment and the consequences of rejecting God. The response effectively communicates the Christian view of hell with clarity and supports it with relevant biblical passages. Well done!"
