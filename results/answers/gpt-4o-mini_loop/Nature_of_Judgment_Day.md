## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In Christian theology, "Judgment Day" refers to the future event when God will judge all humanity for their actions, faith, and decisions made during their lives on Earth. This concept is foundational to Christian belief and is supported by various scripture passages.

1. **The Final Judgment**: This event is often associated with the "Great White Throne Judgment," as described in Revelation 20:11-15. In this passage, the dead are judged according to their deeds, recorded in the books. Those whose names are not found in the Book of Life face eternal separation from God, symbolized by being cast into the lake of fire.

2. **Separation of the Righteous and the Wicked**: Jesus outlines this separation in Matthew 25:31-46, where He, as the Son of Man, will come in glory to divide the sheep (the righteous) from the goats (the wicked). The righteous will inherit eternal life, while the wicked are sent away to eternal punishment.

3. **The Accountability of Everyone**: Romans 14:10-12 emphasizes that every individual will stand before Godâ€™s judgment seat. This underscores the personal responsibility we hold for our lives and the choices we make.

4. **The Role of Faith**: John 3:16-18 highlights the centrality of faith in Jesus Christ. Eternal life is promised to those who believe in Him, while those who do not face judgment. This passage illustrates the importance of accepting Christ for salvation.

In summary, Judgment Day represents a time of ultimate accountability and divine justice. It reveals God's righteousness, extending mercy to the faithful who accept His grace while enacting justice on those who reject Him. This day is a significant aspect of Christian eschatology, serving as both a warning and a source of hope for believers.
