  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and doctrinally accurate explanation of Judgment Day in a Christian context. The student effectively references relevant scripture passages such as Revelation 20:11-15, Matthew 25:31-46, Romans 14:10-12, and John 3:16-18 to support their points. The answer emphasizes the concepts of final judgment, accountability, the role of faith, and the separation of the righteous and the wicked in a clear and coherent manner. Well done!"
