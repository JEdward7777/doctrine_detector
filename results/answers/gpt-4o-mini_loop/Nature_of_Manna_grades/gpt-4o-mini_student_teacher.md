## [Answer](../Nature_of_Manna.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, manna is described as a miraculous food provided by God to the Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness after their Exodus from Egypt. The appearance and taste of manna are depicted in several passages, primarily in the book of Exodus and Numbers.

1. **Appearance**: In Exodus 16:14, manna is described as being "like white coriander seed," with "the appearance of it being like that of bdellium," a type of resin. This description suggests that it had a small, round, and white appearance.

2. **Taste**: Exodus 16:31 states that the taste of manna was "like wafers made with honey." This highlights its sweet flavor, akin to delicate, honey-flavored wafers.

In summary, manna is portrayed as a small, white food with a taste reminiscent of sweet wafers, serving as sustenance for the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness. This divine provision emphasizes God's care and faithfulness to His people throughout their trials.
