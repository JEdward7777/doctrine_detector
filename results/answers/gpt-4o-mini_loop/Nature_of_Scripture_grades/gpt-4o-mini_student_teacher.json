  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 85.\n\nThe student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the relationship between \"scripture\" and \"the word of God\" in the biblical context. They correctly differentiate between the terms and explain how they are related, with a clear reference to relevant biblical passages. Additionally, the student incorporates the broader concept of the \"word of God\" beyond written scripture by mentioning Jesus Christ as the ultimate expression of God's will.\n\nHowever, the student's answer goes slightly beyond the specific concern provided by including the Holy Spirit in their explanation. While the Holy Spirit is indeed essential in Christian theology, the concern was mainly focused on clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word.\n\nOverall, the student has provided a well-reasoned and insightful response, but could improve by staying more focused on the given concern."
