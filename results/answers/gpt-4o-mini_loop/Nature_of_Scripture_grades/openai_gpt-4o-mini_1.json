  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word within a Christian worldview. It effectively clarifies the distinctions between the terms \"scripture\" and \"the word of God\" by integrating biblical references and highlighting the broader application of the term \"the word of God\" to include God's revelation through Jesus Christ. The response maintains a clear Christian perspective and addresses the concern excellently."
