The student effectively integrates biblical references and theological concepts to support their points. However, the answer could benefit from a bit more emphasis on the redemptive work of Christ in overcoming temptation, as ultimately, Christians are empowered to resist through Him. Additionally, a brief mention of the importance of prayer and reliance on God's strength in the face of temptation could enhance the completeness of the response. Great job overall!"
