It effectively integrates the concept of our sinful nature inherited from Adam and Eve, as well as the impact of external influences such as societal pressures and spiritual warfare. The inclusion of relevant biblical references enhances the theological depth of the answer, demonstrating a strong understanding of Christian teaching on temptation."
