## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In Christian theology, both our sinful nature and external influences play significant roles in temptation.

1. **Sinful Nature**: The doctrine of original sin teaches that all humans inherit a sinful nature from Adam and Eve. This inherent condition predisposes individuals to desire sin and rebel against God's commands. The Apostle Paul addresses this struggle in Romans 7:18, stating, "For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh." Our sinful nature acts as a source of temptation, leading us to act contrary to God's will.

2. **External Influences**: In addition to our internal struggles, external factors contribute to temptation. These influences can include societal pressures, negative influences from peers, and the allure of sinful environments. Furthermore, Scripture speaks to the reality of spiritual warfare, indicating that Satan and his forces can actively tempt individuals (Ephesians 6:12). James 1:14-15 captures this dynamic, saying, "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin..."

In summary, the interplay between our sinful nature and external influences profoundly shapes our experience of temptation. Our sinful nature provides the internal inclination toward sin, while external influences can exacerbate or exploit these inclinations. Believers are called to resist temptation through dependence on God's grace, the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, and adherence to Scriptural truths.
