  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of biblical perspectives on wickedness, drawing from relevant verses and themes to support their points. They effectively highlighted the definition, nature, consequences, and potential for repentance of the wicked in light of scripture. The response demonstrated a strong understanding of how biblical teachings on wickedness can influence moral behavior and spiritual growth. However, the student's answer could have been further strengthened by directly aligning their points with the concise reference answer given by the teacher in order to maintain a clearer focus on the question."
