  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComments: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the differentiation between the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible. The student effectively outlines the definitions of soul and spirit, supports the explanation with relevant biblical examples, and discusses the theological implications of understanding these concepts. The answer could be enhanced by incorporating more direct biblical references to support the distinctions between soul and spirit, as well as by emphasizing the biblical foundation of these concepts even more prominently. Overall, a solid explanation with room for slight improvement in biblical grounding."
