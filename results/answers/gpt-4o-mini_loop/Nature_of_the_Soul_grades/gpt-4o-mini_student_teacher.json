  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-structured answer explaining the differentiation between the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible. The answer correctly identified the definitions, biblical examples, common usage, and theological implications of these concepts. However, the answer did not acknowledge the concern that the Bible may present 'soul' and 'spirit' as either distinct concepts or interchangeable terms, which is the key to ensuring accurate interpretation of scripture. It would have been beneficial for the student to address this concern to demonstrate a more thorough understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
