  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical concepts of soul and spirit, clearly outlining their distinct meanings and implications. The provided definitions, examples from Scripture, and common usage all contribute to a comprehensive analysis that effectively addresses the concern about accurately interpreting Scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God.\n\nThe only area for improvement is in the transition between sections 2 and 3. While the response does provide a clear summary at the end, it could benefit from a more explicit connection between the biblical examples and their theological implications. Nevertheless, this is a minor critique in an otherwise excellent response that effectively navigates the complexities of soul and spirit in a biblically informed manner."
