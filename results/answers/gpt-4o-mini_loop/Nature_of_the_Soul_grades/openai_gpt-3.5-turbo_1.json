  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and thorough explanation of the distinctions between 'soul' and 'spirit' in the Bible, highlighting their theological significance. The analysis of biblical examples and theological implications is commendable. However, the response could have emphasized more strongly the importance of understanding the precise biblical definitions of 'soul' and 'spirit' to ensure accurate interpretation of Scripture in relation to human nature and our relationship with God. A stronger connection between the provided answer and the concern would have further enhanced the response."
