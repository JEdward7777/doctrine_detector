## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Nazirite vow, as described in Numbers 6:1-4, involves several key restrictions that signify an individual's commitment to God and separation for a time of holy service. The main restrictions are:

1. **Abstaining from Wine and Strong Drink**: The Nazirite must avoid consuming wine, strong drink, and any products derived from the grapevineâ€”including grape juice, grapes, and raisins. This abstention symbolizes a dedication to spiritual matters over worldly pleasures, reflecting a desire for purity and focus on God.

2. **Avoiding Haircuts**: The individual must not cut their hair for the duration of the vow. The hair represents the visible manifestation of their dedication and consecration to God. Letting the hair grow symbolizes the commitment to the vow and serves as a public declaration of their special status before the Lord.

3. **Avoiding Ritual Defilement**: The Nazirite must not come into contact with dead bodies or graves, even of close relatives. This restriction underscores the importance of maintaining ritual purity, which is critical in the context of worship and service to God. It symbolizes a life set apart for divine purposes, prioritizing spiritual cleanliness over earthly ties.

These restrictions collectively aim to demonstrate a profound sense of holiness and a deep commitment to serving God. They reflect a lifestyle marked by intentional separation from everyday distractions, reinforcing the Nazirite's purpose to live in accordance with God's will during the period of their vow.
