  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow, demonstrating a deep understanding of the significance and purpose of each restriction in the biblical context. The response effectively highlighted the symbolic importance of abstaining from wine and strong drink, avoiding haircuts, and refraining from ritual defilement in relation to dedication, consecration, and purity before God. The student's analysis and interpretation align well with a Christian worldview, earning a high grade."
