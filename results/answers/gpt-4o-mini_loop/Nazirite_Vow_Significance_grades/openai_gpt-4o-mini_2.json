  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the key restrictions of the Nazirite vow, demonstrating a solid understanding of the vow's purpose and significance in a biblical context. The explanation effectively highlights how each restriction symbolizes commitment, purity, consecration, and separation for divine service. The response could have further emphasized the spiritual aspects of the vow and how it relates to one's relationship with God, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
