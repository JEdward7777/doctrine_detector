They have effectively demonstrated an understanding of the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice, as highlighted in the concern provided. The answer incorporates relevant Bible references and theological insights to support their points. However, the answer could have been improved by more directly emphasizing the central theme of Jesus' sacrifice in relation to the transformative power of the new covenant, as indicated in the reference answer."
