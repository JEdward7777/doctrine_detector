  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer regarding the instructions and examples Christians receive in the New Testament regarding the use of Psalms in worship. They effectively highlighted the divinely inspired nature of the Psalms, their role in worship, reflection of Christ, use in prayer and lament, instructional value, and fulfillment in Christ. However, the student could have connected these teachings more directly to contemporary Christian worship practices to address the specified concern.Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic with substantial scriptural references and explanations."
