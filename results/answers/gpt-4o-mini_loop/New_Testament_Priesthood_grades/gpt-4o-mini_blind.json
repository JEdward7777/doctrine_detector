  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This answer provides a thorough and well-supported explanation of the concept of believers being considered priests in the New Testament. The student effectively references key biblical passages, articulates the significance of the priesthood of Jesus, and highlights the shift from the Old Testament priesthood to the priesthood of all believers. The response also connects this doctrine to believers' identity, responsibilities, and service within the Christian community. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound explanation."
