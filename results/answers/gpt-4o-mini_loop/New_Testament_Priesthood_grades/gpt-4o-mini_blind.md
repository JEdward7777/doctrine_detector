## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the New Testament, the concept of believers being considered priests is rooted in the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers. This doctrine emphasizes that all Christians have direct access to God and are called to serve Him and others without the need for a traditional priestly mediator. This idea is significantly derived from several key passages:

1. **1 Peter 2:9** - This verse states, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light." Here, Peter declares that all believers are part of a "royal priesthood," highlighting their new identity in Christ and their calling to represent God and share His message.

2. **Revelation 1:6** and **Revelation 5:10** - These verses describe believers as being made "a kingdom and priests to our God," reinforcing the idea that all followers of Christ hold a priestly status.

3. **The priesthood of Jesus** - The New Testament emphasizes that Jesus is the ultimate High Priest (see Hebrews 4:14-16), who fulfills and surpasses the Old Testament priesthood. He opened the way for all believers to access God directly (Hebrews 10:19-22).

4. **Old Testament Connection** - Understanding the significance of the priesthood in the Old Testament enhances our appreciation of the New Testament concept. In the Old Testament, priests served as mediators between God and the people, performing sacrifices and maintaining the holiness of the temple. With the coming of Christ, who is the perfect and final sacrifice, the need for this mediatorial role has transitioned. Now, every believer, as part of the royal priesthood, can approach God directly and offers their lives as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1).

5. **Ministry to Others** - As priests, believers are called to serve one another and engage in acts of worship and ministry (Romans 12:1). This enhances the communal aspect of the priesthood, where every believer contributes to the body of Christ.

6. **Spiritual Gifts and Service** - Each believer is endowed with spiritual gifts to serve others (1 Corinthians 12). This reflects the priestly calling to mediate God's grace and truth to the world, empowering the Church to fulfill its mission.

In summary, being considered a priest means that every believer in Jesus is empowered to serve God directly, worship, intercede, and minister to others. It signifies a new identity and responsibility in which all Christians can participate in the work of the Gospel, reflecting Godâ€™s love and purposes in the world. The shift from the Old Testament's mediatorial priesthood to the New Testament's universal priesthood of believers highlights the profound nature of our relationship with God through Christ.
