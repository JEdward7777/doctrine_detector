The writer correctly highlights the significance of Jesus as the ultimate High Priest and how his sacrifice has removed the need for a traditional priestly mediator. The discussion on the role of every believer as part of the royal priesthood, serving one another, and engaging in acts of worship and ministry is also well-explained.\n\nHowever, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have further developed the connection between the Old Testament priesthood and the New Testament concept of the universal priesthood of believers. Additionally, some minor points, such as the emphasis on spiritual gifts and service, could have been more explicitly linked to the priesthood theme.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical basis for the priesthood of all believers and its implications for Christian life and practice."
