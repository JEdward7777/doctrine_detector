  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how the concept of purification changes from the Old Testament to the New Testament, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic. The response effectively highlights the shift from external rituals in the Old Testament to the internal transformation and sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament. The student effectively integrates scriptural references and theological concepts to support their argument. However, the student's answer could have been further strengthened by explicitly recognizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
