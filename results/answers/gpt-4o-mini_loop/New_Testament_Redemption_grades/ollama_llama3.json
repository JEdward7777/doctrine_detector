  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the Old Testament concepts of purification as being tied to ritual practices and adherence to the Law, and how these practices are fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus' sacrifice. The distinction between external observance in the Old Testament and internal holiness in the New Testament is also correctly highlighted.\n\nFurthermore, the response specifically addresses the concern by emphasizing that Christ's sacrifice provides eternal purification from sin, rather than requiring continual animal sacrifices or other means of atonement. The focus on repentance and trust in Jesus as the means of purification is also in line with the biblical teaching.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more explicit language highlighting the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the sole means of eternal purification from sin. However, the response does an excellent job of demonstrating this concept through its explanation of the Old and New Testament perspectives on purification. Overall, a strong and accurate response that effectively addresses the concern!"
