It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the central role of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice in bringing about permanent cleansing from sin, aligning well with the Christian worldview of salvation through Christ alone. The only area for improvement could be to tie the specific concern directly to the New Testament concepts discussed in the response for even greater clarity."
