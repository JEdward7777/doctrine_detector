  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the relevant biblical passages and the concept of the Nazirite vow. They provide well-reasoned arguments to support their claim that John the Baptist may have adhered to some Nazirite practices. The inclusion of historical and contextual information adds depth to their analysis. However, the grade is slightly deducted due to the absence of explicit textual evidence directly linking John to the Nazirite vow."
