It effectively addresses the concern of connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to understand biblical continuity. The only point of contention is that while the response presents compelling evidence for John the Baptist adhering to some Nazirite practices, it does not conclusively prove that he was under the Nazirite vow based solely on the angel's announcement to Zechariah. It would have been stronger if additional direct references to the Nazirite vow were provided."
