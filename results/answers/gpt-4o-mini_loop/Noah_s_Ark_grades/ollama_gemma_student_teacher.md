## [Answer](../Noah_s_Ark.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The purpose of Noah's Ark, as described in the Bible, was primarily to preserve Noah, his family, and pairs of every kind of animal from the impending flood that God sent to cleanse the earth of its wickedness. This account is detailed in the Book of Genesis, particularly in chapters 6 through 9.

God chose Noah because he was deemed righteous in his generation. The Ark served as a vessel for survival and a means of starting anew after the floodwaters receded. Specifically, the significant purposes included:

1. **Preservation of Life**: The Ark was constructed to save Noah, his family, and representatives of every animal species from the judgment of the flood (Genesis 6:18-20).

2. **Judgment of Sin**: The flood represented God's righteous judgment on a corrupt and violent world. The Ark symbolized both judgment and mercy, providing a means of salvation for the faithful (Genesis 6:5-7).

3. **Covenant Establishment**: After the flood, God established a new covenant with Noah, promising never to destroy the earth with a flood again and signified this covenant with the rainbow (Genesis 9:12-17).

In summary, the Ark was a divine provision for preservation amid judgment, illustrating the overarching themes of salvation and covenant throughout the biblical narrative.
