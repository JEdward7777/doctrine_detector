## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Bible outlines several actions and behaviors that are categorized as folly or foolishness. Here are some examples:

1. **Rejecting Wisdom**: Proverbs frequently speaks about the foolishness of rejecting wisdom and instruction. For instance, Proverbs 1:7 states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction."

2. **Pride and Arrogance**: Proverbs 16:18 warns that "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." A proud heart is often associated with folly and leads to one's downfall.

3. **Hasty Speech**: Proverbs 29:20 highlights the folly of speaking without thought: "Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him." This emphasizes the importance of careful communication.

4. **Indulgence in Sin**: Ecclesiastes 10:2-3 contrasts wise behavior with foolishness, stating, "A wise man's heart inclines him to the right, but a fool's heart to the left. Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense, and he says to everyone that he is a fool." This illustrates the way of the fool as one that is not aligned with God's path.

5. **Lack of Self-Control**: Proverbs 25:28 compares a person without self-control to a city broken into and left without walls, indicating vulnerability and a lack of wisdom in one's life.

6. **Pursuing Temporal Pleasures**: In 1 Corinthians 3:19, Paul asserts, "For the wisdom of this world is folly with God." Seeking worldly wisdom and pleasures rather than God's wisdom is seen as foolishness in the eyes of the Lord.

7. **Ignoring God’s Commands**: Psalm 14:1 states, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God.'" Denying God's existence or ignoring His commandments is a fundamental characteristic of folly in Scripture.

8. **Wasting Resources**: The parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32) illustrates folly through the reckless spending of one's inheritance on extravagant living, serving as a warning against irresponsible stewardship.

9. **Being Unteachable**: Proverbs 12:15 notes, "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice," indicating that a fool often refuses to learn and is self-reliant rather than receptive to wisdom.

10. **Lack of Planning**: Proverbs 21:5 advises, "The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty." This scripture points out that impulsive actions without foresight are considered foolish.

These examples reflect a broader biblical understanding of wisdom and folly, emphasizing the importance of living in accordance with God's principles and teachings. Through these insights, believers are encouraged to cultivate discernment and seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in their daily lives.
