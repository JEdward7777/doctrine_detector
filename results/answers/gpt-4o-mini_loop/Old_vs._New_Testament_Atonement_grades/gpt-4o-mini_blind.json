The student effectively highlights the sacrificial system, the Day of Atonement, ceremonial cleansing in the Old Testament, and contrasts them with the fulfillment in Christ, substitutionary atonement, new covenant, and universal scope in the New Testament. The analysis is well-supported with relevant scriptural references and theological explanations, showcasing a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
