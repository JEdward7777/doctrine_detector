  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights the transition from temporary atonement in the Old Testament to permanent atonement through Christ in the New Testament. It provides a detailed explanation of how the sacrificial system in the Old Testament pointed towards the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, emphasizing His once-and-for-all atonement for sin. The inclusion of Old Testament practices like the Day of Atonement and ceremonial cleansing, along with the New Testament concepts of substitution, new covenant, and universal scope, solidifies the understanding of atonement in biblical history. The response incorporates key biblical references and theological themes to support the Christian worldview effectively."
