  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response to the concern of emphasizing the concept of \"One God\" in translating the Bible for cultures with multiple deities. The strategies outlined demonstrate a deep understanding of the complexity of the task at hand and offer practical approaches to address it effectively. However, the student could have further emphasized the unique nature of God and the doctrine of the Trinity, as suggested in the reference answer from the teacher. Overall, a strong effort was made to balance cultural sensitivity with upholding biblical truth."
