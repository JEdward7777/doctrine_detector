It addresses the concern by providing specific strategies that maintain the integrity of biblical monotheism and effectively engage with the cultural context. The suggested strategies are grounded in biblical principles and demonstrate a nuanced understanding of both the theological importance of monotheism and the need for sensitivity to cultural beliefs. Overall, this response is thorough, insightful, and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
