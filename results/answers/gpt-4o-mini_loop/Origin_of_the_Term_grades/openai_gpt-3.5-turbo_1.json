  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and accurate explanation of when and where Jesus' followers were first called \"Christians,\" citing Acts 11:26 as the source. The response effectively highlights the historical context and significance of the term 'Christian' by emphasizing the distinct identity it conferred upon the early followers of Jesus in Antioch. The only room for improvement would be to further elaborate on the broader implications and impact of this designation in shaping the identity and growth of the early Christian movement."
