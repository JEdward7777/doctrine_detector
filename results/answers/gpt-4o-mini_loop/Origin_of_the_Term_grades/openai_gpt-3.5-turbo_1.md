## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Jesus' followers were first called "Christians" in Antioch. This is mentioned in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, specifically in Acts 11:26, which states, "And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch, the disciples were first called Christians." This marks an important point in the early church as it signifies the identity of Jesus' followers as distinct from other groups at that time. The term not only reflects their belief in Christ but also indicates the growing influence of Christianity as a separate movement during the first century.

Comment: This response provides a clear and accurate explanation of when and where Jesus' followers were first called "Christians," citing Acts 11:26 as the source. The response effectively highlights the historical context and significance of the term 'Christian' by emphasizing the distinct identity it conferred upon the early followers of Jesus in Antioch. The only room for improvement would be to further elaborate on the broader implications and impact of this designation in shaping the identity and growth of the early Christian movement.
