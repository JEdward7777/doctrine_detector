## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, the Hebrews are traditionally believed to be descendants of Abraham, who is considered the patriarch of the Hebrew people. Abraham’s lineage is significant because it establishes the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people. The Hebrews are specifically descended from Abraham through his son Isaac, and then through Isaac’s son Jacob, who was later named Israel. Jacob had twelve sons, and their descendants formed the twelve tribes of Israel. This lineage is foundational to the identity of the Hebrew people and plays a crucial role in the narrative of the Old Testament. The term “Hebrew” is often used to refer to the descendants of Jacob (Israel) and their collective identity as the people of God. Through this lineage, the faith and heritage of the Hebrew people are deeply intertwined with God’s promises and the unfolding of His plans for salvation.
