  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how the concept of pardon is intertwined with God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ. They effectively referenced biblical passages and theological concepts to support their claims. However, there was a slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer in terms of the simplicity and directness of the explanation. Overall, it was a well-written response that effectively explored the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness."
