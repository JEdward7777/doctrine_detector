The student accurately connects the historical Passover event with its fulfillment in Jesus Christ, emphasizing His role as the ultimate Passover lamb and the atonement for sin. Additionally, the mention of the Last Supper and the institution of the Eucharist further solidifies the connection between Passover and the new covenant in Christ. The answer effectively communicates the theological implications of Passover for Christians while maintaining doctrinal correctness. Great job overall!"
