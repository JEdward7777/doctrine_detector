  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 95. The student has provided a detailed and well-written explanation of the connection between the Old Testament Passover and the New Testament revelation of Jesus. They accurately explain how Jesus is seen as the fulfillment of the Passover lamb in Christian theology and reference key scripture passages to support their explanation. The student effectively communicates the theological significance of Passover for Christians in relation to Jesus and includes important details about the Last Supper and the institution of the Eucharist. The student's response shows a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on the relationship between Passover and Jesus."
