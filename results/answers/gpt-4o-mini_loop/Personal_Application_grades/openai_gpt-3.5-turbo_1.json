It emphasizes the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The response could be further strengthened by explicitly connecting the importance of repentance and trusting in Jesus' sacrifice to the ongoing process of sanctification and daily living out of righteousness."
