The student effectively connects the phrase to biblical usage, particularly referencing Isaiah 6:5, and explores its implications for recognizing personal sin and the need for repentance. The explanation is well-reasoned, supported by relevant scripture, and highlights the significance of humility and divine redemption. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological implications of the expression. Great job!"
