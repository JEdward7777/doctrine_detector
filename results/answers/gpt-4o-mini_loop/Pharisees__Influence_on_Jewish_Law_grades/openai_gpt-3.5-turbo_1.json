It effectively addresses the concern by illustrating how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Law of Moses created conflicts due to their focus on the letter rather than the spirit of the law emphasized by Jesus. The explanations are clear, supported by relevant biblical references, and offer a Christian perspective on the significance of understanding the Pharisees' role in the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry."
