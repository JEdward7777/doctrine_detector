The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of the Pharisees' influence on Jesus' ministry and the subsequent development of early Christian beliefs. The only minor suggestion would be to perhaps include a stronger connection to how these insights can deepen one's understanding of the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry."
