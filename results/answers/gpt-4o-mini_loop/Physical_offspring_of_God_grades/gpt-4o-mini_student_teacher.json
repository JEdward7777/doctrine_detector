  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the term \"Son of God\" for someone who may misunderstand it as implying physical offspring of God. The response effectively integrates key biblical references, theological concepts, historical context, and analogies to convey the spiritual and relational aspects of Jesus' divine sonship. The explanation is thorough and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. However, the grade is slightly lower than perfect as the answer could have been more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer from the teacher."
