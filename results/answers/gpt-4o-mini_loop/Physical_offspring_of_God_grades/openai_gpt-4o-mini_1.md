To clarify the term "Son of God" for someone who may interpret it as indicating a physical offspring of God, it is essential to highlight the theological and relational dimensions of the term as used in Christian Scripture. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Biblical Context**: The term "Son of God" appears in various passages throughout the Bible, reflecting a unique and divine relationship between Jesus and God the Father. This emphasizes Jesus' divine nature rather than suggesting a physical descent. For example, John 1:1-14 articulates that Jesus, as the Word, was both with God and was God, showcasing His eternal existence and divine status.

2. **Spiritual Meaning**: “Son of God” signifies Jesus’ divinity and His role within the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19). This doctrine reveals that Jesus is fully God and fully human, affirming His equality with the Father (John 10:30), while also being a distinct person within the Godhead.

3. **Covenantal Relationship**: In the Old Testament, the term can refer to the nation of Israel (Exodus 4:22) or to kings and leaders (Psalm 2:7). These usages showcase that being a "son" in the biblical sense often implies a special relationship, covenant, or role rather than a physical lineage.

4. **Incarnation**: The belief in the incarnation—that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary (Luke 1:35)—reinforces the uniqueness of His sonship. He is seen as both fully divine and fully human, which is fundamentally different from typical human parentage.

5. **Theological Interpretation**: The early church fathers and subsequent theologians stressed that the term points to Jesus’ divine nature and role in salvation, not suggesting any physical family ties. This theological framework has been developed over centuries, promoting the understanding that ‘sonship’ is primarily about relationship and authority derived from being part of the Godhead.

6. **Clarification with Analogies**: Using analogies may help illustrate the relational aspect of being a "son." For instance, a king may have many sons, but each son reflects the king's authority and character without being a mere product of physical attributes. This can help bring clarity to the concept of sonship.

7. **Explore Church Creeds**: Encourage an exploration of historic creeds and confessions, such as the Nicene Creed, which articulate the understanding of the Trinity and the nature of Christ. These documents can provide a solid theological foundation for grasping the term "Son of God."

Encourage an open dialogue where questions can be asked, underscoring that understanding this term may require time and thoughtful study, often involving deep reflection on Scripture and church tradition.
