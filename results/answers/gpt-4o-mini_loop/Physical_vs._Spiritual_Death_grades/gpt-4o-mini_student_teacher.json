  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the distinction between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' from a Christian worldview. They effectively highlight the theological implications and consequences of spiritual death, drawing on relevant biblical references to support their points. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the teacher's reference answer to align more closely with it in terms of conciseness while maintaining the depth of explanation provided."
