  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response thoroughly addresses the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death, providing biblical support and theological implications. The writer effectively explains the significance of the term \"perish\" in a spiritual context, highlighting its connection to eternal separation from God. Additionally, the response provides examples from various Scriptures, demonstrating the context-dependent nature of the term.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly stated the answer's relevance to the concern. While it does address the distinction between physical and spiritual death, it may not be immediately clear how this information relates back to the original concern. Nevertheless, the overall quality of the response is high, and its attention to theological nuance is impressive.\n\nGrade: 90\n\nComment: This response is well-organized, biblically grounded, and provides a nuanced understanding of physical and spiritual death. While it could benefit from more explicit connections to the original concern, its overall quality earns a high grade."
