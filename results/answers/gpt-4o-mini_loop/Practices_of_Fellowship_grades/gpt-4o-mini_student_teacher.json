  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive overview of how early Christians expressed their fellowship, encompassing various aspects of communal practices and shared beliefs. While the answer goes beyond the reference answer in detailing specific practices and their significance, it effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how these practices can help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other. The depth and thoroughness of the response merit a high grade, but there is slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of additional details provided."
