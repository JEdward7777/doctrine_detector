  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and comprehensive explanation of the concept of predestination in a Christian context, drawing upon Biblical references and presenting different interpretations within Christian traditions. They effectively addressed the concern of understanding predestination in relation to salvation. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and effectively integrates theological concepts. However, there was some complexity and detail in the student's answer that may have exceeded the simplicity of the reference answer."
