  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85. \n\nThe student has provided a thorough and insightful analysis of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in Biblical prophecies. They have covered various aspects of the term, such as its symbolic representation of Jerusalem, expression of grief and hope, theological significance, and connection to the New Testament. The student has effectively demonstrated an understanding of the term's prophetic nature and historical context.\n\nHowever, the answer could be improved by directly addressing the concern of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context to better apply the scriptures today. While the student has touched upon these aspects indirectly throughout the response, making it more explicit would strengthen the connection between the analysis provided and the specified concern.\n\nOverall, the student has shown a good grasp of the topic but could enhance the alignment with the concern to receive a higher grade."
