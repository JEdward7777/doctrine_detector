  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, drawing from relevant passages and doctrinal insights. However, the answer did not precisely align with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasized persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will as the primary purpose of exhortation. While the student's answer did touch on these aspects, the emphasis on encouraging, building up the church, and guiding believers in their faith journey was more prominent. A slightly lower grade is given due to the deviation from the reference answer's specific focus on persuading others to avoid sin."
