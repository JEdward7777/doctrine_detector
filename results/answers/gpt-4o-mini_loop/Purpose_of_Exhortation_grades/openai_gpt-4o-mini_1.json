  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, citing relevant key passages and highlighting the importance of exhortation within the Christian community. The interpretation was well-supported scripturally and effectively integrated a Christian worldview perspective into the discussion. The only minor point is that the provided answer in the initial response was slightly paraphrased rather than directly quoted, which could have been more precise. Overall, an excellent understanding and application of biblical principles regarding exhortation."
