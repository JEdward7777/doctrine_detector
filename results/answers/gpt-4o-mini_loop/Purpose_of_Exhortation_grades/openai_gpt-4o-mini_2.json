  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, utilizing key passages from the New Testament to support the purpose and significance of exhortation. The integration of scriptural references and doctrinal context demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the given answer in the concluding remarks to further highlight the contrast between the initial statement and the comprehensive explanation provided in the response."
