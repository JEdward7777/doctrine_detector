  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-articulated response to the question of living a holy life as a Christian. They have effectively outlined key principles and practices that guide believers in striving for holiness, incorporating biblical references to support their points. The answer aligns closely with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of following God's commandments, engaging with Scripture, and relying on the Holy Spirit for transformation. The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the practical application of holiness in a believer's life. The grade is slightly below perfect as the answer goes into more detail and explores additional aspects beyond the teacher's reference answer, which is commendable."
