## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings was to convey deeper spiritual truths and moral lessons in a way that was relatable and accessible to his audience. Parables often drew on everyday situations and familiar imagery to illustrate complex theological ideas. This method served several key purposes:

1. **Engagement**: Parables captured the attention of listeners, prompting them to think critically about the meanings behind the stories.

2. **Revelation and Concealment**: Jesus indicated that parables served both to reveal truths to those receptive to his message and to conceal them from those who were hardened in heart (Matthew 13:10-17). This dual function emphasized the condition of the listener’s heart and their openness to God’s truth.

3. **Memorable Teaching**: The storytelling nature of parables made them memorable, allowing the essential lessons to resonate long after the teaching had ended.

4. **Inviting Reflection**: Parables encouraged personal reflection and self-examination. Listeners were often left to ponder the implications of the story for their own lives, encouraging them to apply the lessons personally.

Overall, Jesus’ use of parables was a profound teaching method that invited listeners to engage more deeply with his message about the Kingdom of God, its values, and the nature of God’s love and grace.
