  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive understanding of the purposes of Jesus using parables, the answer could have been more concise and focused on the core purpose of Jesus using parables, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's response touched on various facets of parables without emphasizing the primary purpose of conveying moral truths and hiding them from those who were not receptive.\n\nThe student demonstrated a strong grasp of the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith. However, a clearer alignment with the specific concern provided would have resulted in a more focused and accurate response."
