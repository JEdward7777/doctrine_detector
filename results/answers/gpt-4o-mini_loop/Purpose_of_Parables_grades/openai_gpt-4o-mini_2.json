The student effectively connects the purpose of using parables to engage listeners, reveal and conceal truths based on the condition of the heart, create memorable teaching moments, and encourage personal reflection. The response is well-supported with relevant scriptural references and aligns with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of engaging with Jesus' message about the Kingdom of God."
