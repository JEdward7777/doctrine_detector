  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer to the question, drawing on relevant biblical perspectives to explain the purpose of tests that God allows believers to experience. The answer is doctrinally sound and effectively conveys key theological insights regarding spiritual growth, refining faith, preparation for service, building dependency on God, and demonstrating faith. The student could enhance the answer by connecting each point more explicitly to specific biblical passages or doctrines to further strengthen the doctrinal foundation of the explanation."
