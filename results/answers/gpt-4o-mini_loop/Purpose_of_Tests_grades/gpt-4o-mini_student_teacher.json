The student effectively integrated relevant Bible verses to support their points. While the teacher's reference answer focuses on repentance and drawing closer to God, the student's response provides a well-rounded perspective on the multifaceted purposes of tests in a believer's life. Great job connecting biblical principles with the question at hand!"
