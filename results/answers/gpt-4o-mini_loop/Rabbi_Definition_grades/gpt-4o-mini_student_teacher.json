The response effectively addresses the significance of the term in highlighting Jesus' role as a teacher and spiritual leader. However, deducting some points for slightly veering away from the specific concern of the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. The student could strengthen the response by directly linking the role of rabbinic teaching in shaping Jesus' method of instruction and interactions with His followers in the New Testament."
