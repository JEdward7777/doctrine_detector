  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term 'Rabbi' within the Christian context, emphasizing Jesus' role as a teacher and spiritual leader in the New Testament. It effectively links the significance of rabbinic teaching to Christian theology and discipleship. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or references from the New Testament to further support the points made."
