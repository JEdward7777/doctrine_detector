  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the significance of Jesus being referred to as a ransom in the context of Christianity. The student effectively integrates key biblical passages, theological concepts such as substitutionary atonement, and the broader implications of Jesus' sacrificial death for humanity. The response also appropriately emphasizes the themes of redemption, fulfillment of prophecy, and universal offer of salvation. Moving forward, the student could strengthen the response by further exploring the implications of Jesus' role as ransom in terms of justice, mercy, and the restoration of relationship with God. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound discussion."
