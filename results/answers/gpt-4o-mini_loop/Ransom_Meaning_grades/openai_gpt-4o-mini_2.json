It effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on how Jesus' sacrifice as a ransom leads to redemption and offers salvation to sinful individuals. The biblical references, theological connections, and implications for the broader Christian worldview are all clearly articulated and aligned with a Christian specific worldview. Great job!"
