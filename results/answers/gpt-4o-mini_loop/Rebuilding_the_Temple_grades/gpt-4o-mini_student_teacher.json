  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70 \n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed overview of the historical events surrounding the destruction and subsequent rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem. They effectively highlighted the spiritual significance and prophetic aspects of these events, connecting them to broader theological themes. However, the student veered extensively into theological interpretations and perspectives beyond the historical context and significance specified in the concern. While their answer is well-written and insightful, it somewhat missed the mark in focusing solely on the historical context and significance."
