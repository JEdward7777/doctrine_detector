The apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or the Eucharist, as a regular practice for believers to fulfill several key theological and communal purposes:

1. **Remembrance of Christ’s Sacrifice**: In 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, Paul recounts the words of Jesus during the Last Supper, emphasizing that the bread and cup are symbols of Christ's body and blood. By partaking in this meal, believers remember and proclaim the significance of Christ’s death and resurrection until He returns. This act serves as a continual reminder of the central event of the Christian faith—the sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of humanity.

2. **Community and Unity**: The Lord's Supper serves as a communal act that brings believers together. It reflects the unity of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 10:16-17). By sharing in the one bread and one cup, Christians symbolize their togetherness in faith and fellowship, reinforcing the idea that they are all part of one body, regardless of their individual backgrounds.

3. **Spiritual Nourishment**: Paul suggests that partaking in the Lord's Supper provides spiritual sustenance. Just as physical food nourishes the body, the bread and cup provide spiritual nourishment and strength to live out the Christian life. This reflects the importance of maintaining a relationship with Christ and being filled with His presence.

4. **Examination and Holiness**: In 1 Corinthians 11:27-32, Paul stresses the importance of self-examination before participating in the Lord's Supper. He teaches that believers should approach the table thoughtfully, recognizing the seriousness of the covenant they are affirming. This call to examination fosters a sense of accountability and encourages believers to live in a manner consistent with their faith.

5. **Anticipation of Christ’s Return**: The Lord’s Supper also carries an eschatological dimension, as it anticipates the return of Christ. By participating in this sacrament, believers look forward to the consummation of God's kingdom, reflecting hope and expectation.

In summary, Paul's establishment of the Lord's Supper as a regular practice for believers serves to center Christian faith around the remembrance of Christ's sacrificial love, promote unity and fellowship among believers, provide spiritual nourishment, encourage self-examination, and foster anticipation of Christ's return.
