  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides an excellent explanation of the differences and similarities between the terms \"propitiation\" and \"atonement\" within a Christian theological framework. It effectively clarifies how propitiation specifically emphasizes appeasing God's wrath, while atonement encompasses the broader concept of reconciliation with God. The response is thorough, well-structured, and demonstrates a clear understanding of these important theological concepts."
