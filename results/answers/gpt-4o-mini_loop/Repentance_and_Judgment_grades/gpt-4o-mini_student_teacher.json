  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that thoroughly explores the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God within a Christian worldview. They have effectively utilized relevant biblical passages and examples to illustrate their points. However, the student could have emphasized even more prominently the direct link between repentance and the avoidance of God's judgment, aligning it more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a strong effort in integrating biblical references and theological insight."
