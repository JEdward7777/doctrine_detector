## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This significant event is recorded in the Book of Acts, specifically in Acts 1:15-26. After the betrayal and subsequent death of Judas, the remaining apostles gathered to seek God’s guidance in selecting a replacement. They cast lots to determine who would take Judas’s place, and Matthias was chosen and numbered among the eleven apostles, reaffirming the importance of divine providence in the early church.

Grade: 90

Comment: The student accurately identified Matthias as the chosen replacement for Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles and provided a detailed explanation of the event as recorded in the Book of Acts. However, to fully address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, the student could have delved deeper into the theological significance of this act and how it demonstrates the ongoing establishment and authority of the apostolic leadership within the early church.
