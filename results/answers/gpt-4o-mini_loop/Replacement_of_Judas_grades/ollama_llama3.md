## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This significant event is recorded in the Book of Acts, specifically in Acts 1:15-26. After the betrayal and subsequent death of Judas, the remaining apostles gathered to seek God’s guidance in selecting a replacement. They cast lots to determine who would take Judas’s place, and Matthias was chosen and numbered among the eleven apostles, reaffirming the importance of divine providence in the early church.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 80

The response provides a good overview of the event, accurately stating that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and subsequent death. The mention of the Book of Acts and the specific passage (Acts 1:15-26) adds credibility and demonstrates an understanding of the biblical account.

However, the concern about recognizing continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension is not fully met. While the response does acknowledge the importance of divine providence in the early church, it doesn't explicitly emphasize the continuity of apostolic leadership. To meet this concern more fully, the response could have highlighted how Matthias' selection maintained the integrity and authority of the original twelve apostles, ensuring the continued spread of Jesus' teachings and message.

Overall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the event but falls short in fully addressing the concern about continuity of apostolic leadership.
