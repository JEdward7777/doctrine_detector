## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This significant event is recorded in the Book of Acts, specifically in Acts 1:15-26. After the betrayal and subsequent death of Judas, the remaining apostles gathered to seek God’s guidance in selecting a replacement. They cast lots to determine who would take Judas’s place, and Matthias was chosen and numbered among the eleven apostles, reaffirming the importance of divine providence in the early church.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately highlights the key point that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death. However, the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension is not fully addressed. Connecting Matthias's appointment to the ongoing leadership structure established by Jesus before His ascension would enhance the response from a Christian perspective.
