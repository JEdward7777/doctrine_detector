Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This significant event is recorded in the Book of Acts, specifically in Acts 1:15-26. After the betrayal and subsequent death of Judas, the remaining apostles gathered to seek God’s guidance in selecting a replacement. They cast lots to determine who would take Judas’s place, and Matthias was chosen and numbered among the eleven apostles, reaffirming the importance of divine providence in the early church.
