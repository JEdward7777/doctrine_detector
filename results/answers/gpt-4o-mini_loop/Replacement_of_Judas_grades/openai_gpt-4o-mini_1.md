## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. This significant event is recorded in the Book of Acts, specifically in Acts 1:15-26. After the betrayal and subsequent death of Judas, the remaining apostles gathered to seek God’s guidance in selecting a replacement. They cast lots to determine who would take Judas’s place, and Matthias was chosen and numbered among the eleven apostles, reaffirming the importance of divine providence in the early church.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately states the event of Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death. However, the concern regarding the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension is not directly addressed in the response. Connecting Matthias' selection to the continuity of apostolic leadership would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
