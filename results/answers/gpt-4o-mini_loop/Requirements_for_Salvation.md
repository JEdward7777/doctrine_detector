What does the Bible say is required for a person to be saved?

The Bible outlines several key components regarding salvation, with the central focus being on faith in Jesus Christ. Here are important elements that highlight what is required for salvation:

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: John 3:16 states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Belief in Jesus as the Savior is foundational to receiving salvation.

2. **Sacrificial Death and Resurrection**: Romans 5:8 highlights the importance of Jesus' sacrificial death for the forgiveness of sins: "But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." His resurrection, affirmed in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, assures believers of the victory over sin and death.

3. **Repentance**: Luke 13:3 states, "I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish." A genuine acknowledgment of sin, coupled with a turning away from it, is crucial in the process of salvation.

4. **Grace**: Ephesians 2:8-9 emphasizes that salvation is by grace through faith, not by works: "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast." This highlights that salvation is a gift from God rather than a result of human effort.

5. **Confession**: Romans 10:9-10 teaches the importance of openly confessing oneâ€™s faith: "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." This confession signifies a commitment to faith in Christ.

6. **New Birth**: John 3:3 emphasizes the necessity of being "born again": "Jesus replied, 'Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.'" This transformation is essential for a true relationship with God.

In summary, these passages indicate that salvation involves faith in Christ, acknowledgment of His sacrificial death and resurrection, repentance from sin, grace from God, confession of faith, and a transformative new birth in Christ. These themes are recognized across mainstream Christianity and illustrate the comprehensive nature of salvation through Jesus. Additionally, the doctrine of justification by faith alone underscores that believers are declared righteous before God solely through faith in Jesus, further affirming the grace inherent in salvation.
