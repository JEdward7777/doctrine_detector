  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of Peter's address to the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion, highlighting both human responsibility and divine purpose. The response effectively integrates the themes of repentance, forgiveness, and the sovereignty of God in the redemption story. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and closely aligned with the reference answer, which more directly focused on Peter's emphasis on repentance and faith in response to the gospel. Overall, a strong understanding of the Christian worldview is demonstrated in the analysis of Peter's message."
