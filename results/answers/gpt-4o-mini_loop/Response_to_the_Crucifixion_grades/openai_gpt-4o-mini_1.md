## [Answer](../Response_to_the_Crucifixion.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In Acts 2:22-23, during his speech at Pentecost, the Apostle Peter addresses the crowd with a poignant acknowledgment of their involvement in the crucifixion of Jesus. He tells them that they, along with their religious leaders, handed Jesus over to be killed and crucified. Peter emphasizes that Jesus was "delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God." This statement illustrates that while the crowd bore responsibility for their actions, the crucifixion was also part of God's sovereign plan for humanity's redemption.

Peterâ€™s message balances human accountability with divine purpose. He calls the crowd to repentance, stressing that despite their participation in the rejection and crucifixion of Jesus, there is forgiveness available to them through Christ, who triumphed over death by being raised from the dead. This interplay of human responsibility and divine grace is central to Peter's address and core to the Christian understanding of salvation.
