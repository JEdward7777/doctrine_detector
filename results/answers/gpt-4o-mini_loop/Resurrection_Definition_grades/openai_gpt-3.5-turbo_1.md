## [Answer](../Resurrection_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In a Christian context, the term 'resurrection' primarily refers to the act of rising from the dead, particularly in relation to Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal life for believers. 

1. **Resurrection of Jesus Christ**: Central to Christian belief, the resurrection of Jesus is seen as the culmination of his redemptive work. Christians affirm that after Jesus was crucified and died, he rose from the dead on the third day, an event celebrated on Easter Sunday. This moment is viewed as a decisive victory over sin and death, affirming Jesus as the Son of God and providing believers with the hope of their own resurrection.

2. **Resurrection of Believers**: According to Christian doctrine, at the end of times, a general resurrection of the dead will take place. Those who have died in Christ will be resurrected to eternal life, while others will face judgment. Key biblical passages that underscore this promise include 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 and John 5:28-29.

3. **Spiritual Resurrection**: Furthermore, Christians believe in a spiritual resurrection that occurs when an individual places their faith in Christ. This is often referred to as being "born again" (John 3:3), where people experience a transformative new life through their relationship with Jesus.

Overall, resurrection in Christianity embodies the themes of hope, renewal, and divine victory over death, which are fundamental to Christian faith and doctrine.
