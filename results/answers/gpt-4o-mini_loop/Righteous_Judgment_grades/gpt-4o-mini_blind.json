  "grade_comment": "Grade: 93\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of how Christians reconcile God's wrath with His nature as loving and merciful. The student effectively articulates key theological points, such as the multifaceted nature of God, the relationship between love, justice, and mercy, and the redemptive purpose of God's wrath. The use of biblical references and the integration of Christian doctrines enrich the response. A few minor improvements could include further emphasizing the foundational role of Jesus Christ in reconciling God's attributes and tightening the language for increased clarity. Overall, this is a thorough and doctrinally sound analysis."
