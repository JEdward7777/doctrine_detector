## [Answer](../Role_of_Angels_in_Human_Affairs.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Angels serve God in several significant ways according to biblical references:

1. **Messengers of God**: One of the primary roles of angels is to deliver messages from God to humans. This is evident in instances such as the angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus to Mary (Luke 1:26-38) and the angel speaking to Zechariah about the birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1:11-20). Additionally, angels communicated God’s plans to Abraham (Genesis 18:1-3) and provided guidance to Lot (Genesis 19:1-3), showcasing their role as divine communicators throughout the Old Testament.

2. **Ministers of God’s Will**: Angels carry out God’s will and execute His commands. Psalm 103:20 mentions that angels are mighty ones who do His bidding and obey His word. They carry out divine judgments, as seen when an angel strikes down the Assyrian army (2 Kings 19:35), demonstrating their active participation in fulfilling God’s plans and executing justice.

3. **Worshipers of God**: Angels are depicted as beings who worship and glorify God. In Isaiah 6:1-3, seraphim are shown praising God, declaring, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory." Likewise, the book of Revelation describes angels surrounding the throne of God in worship (Revelation 4:8), emphasizing the significance of angelic worship in the heavenly hierarchy.

4. **Protectors and Guardians**: Angels are often assigned to protect and guide God’s people. Psalm 91:11-12 speaks of God commanding His angels to guard His followers in all their ways. In the narrative of Daniel, an angel protects him in the lions' den (Daniel 6:22), and in Acts 12:7-11, an angel helps release Peter from prison, illustrating their role in divine protection.

5. **Witnesses and Executors of God’s Justice**: Angels maintain a role as witnesses in God's creation and are involved in administering justice. They are said to participate in the final judgment (Matthew 13:39-41, Revelation 20:1). Their roles as executioners of God's justice reflect the belief in a divine order upheld by angelic beings.

6. **Encouragers and Comforters**: Angels can serve to encourage and comfort believers. In Luke 22:43, an angel appears to Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane to strengthen Him, underscoring their comforting presence during times of anguish.

7. **Servants to Believers**: Hebrews 1:14 indicates that angels are "ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation," signifying their role in assisting believers in their spiritual journey. This highlights the relational aspect of angelic ministry, connecting them directly to God’s people.

These roles illustrate the multifaceted ways in which angels serve God and His purposes, acting both in the spiritual realm and in the lives of individuals. Their actions reflect a profound connection to the heavenly hierarchy and the overarching narrative of God's redemptive work throughout Scripture.
