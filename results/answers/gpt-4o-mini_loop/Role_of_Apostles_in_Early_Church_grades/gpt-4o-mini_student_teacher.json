  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student's response provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers. They have effectively highlighted key lessons that can be drawn from the apostles' behaviors and actions, tying them back to the importance of teaching, prayer, unity, community engagement, outreach, and reliance on the Holy Spirit. The inclusion of specific scriptural references enhances the theological depth of their answer. While the response is thorough and well-structured, the only slight criticism is that it may be overly expansive, covering a wide range of lessons without deeply exploring each one. Despite this minor concern, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively connects it to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
