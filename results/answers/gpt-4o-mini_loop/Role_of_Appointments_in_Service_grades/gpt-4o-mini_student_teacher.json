  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated response addressing various aspects of how Christians are called to fulfill their roles within the Church. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of biblical principles related to serving, using spiritual gifts, supporting one another, leadership, worship, unity, evangelism, and holiness. While the response offers a detailed explanation, it may have slightly deviated by providing more specific examples and elaboration than necessary. However, the inclusion of relevant Bible verses and a clear structure enhance the overall quality of the answer."
