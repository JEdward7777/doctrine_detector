## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The prophet Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David in a very strategic and profound way, as recorded in 2 Samuel 12:1-7. After David's adultery with Bathsheba and the orchestrated death of her husband Uriah, Nathan was sent by God to confront David about his sins.

Nathan approached David and shared a parable about two men in a city—one rich and one poor. The rich man had an abundance of flocks and herds, while the poor man had only one little ewe lamb that he cherished like a daughter. When a traveler visited the rich man, instead of taking from his own plentiful supply, he took the poor man's lamb to prepare a meal for his guest. Upon hearing this story, David was filled with anger and declared that the rich man deserved to die and must repay the poor man fourfold for his terrible actions.

Then Nathan revealed the true purpose of the parable by declaring, "You are the man!" (2 Samuel 12:7), thereby exposing David's sin in a powerful manner. Through this method, Nathan was able to convict David without outright accusation at first, allowing David to relate to the story and engage with it on a deeper moral level. This led to David's realization of his own sins, as he understood that the rich man represented him.

Nathan's use of a parable highlights his wisdom and the effectiveness of storytelling in conveying deep truths, ultimately leading to David's acknowledgment of his sin and his heartfelt repentance, which is poignantly expressed in Psalm 51. This narrative demonstrates God's desire for correction, forgiveness, and restoration, and it serves as a powerful example of God’s grace in the journey of repentance.
