  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how the prophet Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David. The response effectively highlights the strategic use of storytelling to reveal David's sin and lead him to repentance. The analysis is thorough and demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical narrative and the use of parables for correction and revelation in this context. The student effectively tied in the importance of repentance and God's grace in the process. A minor deduction is made for the slight elaboration beyond the direct question, but overall, this is an excellent response."
