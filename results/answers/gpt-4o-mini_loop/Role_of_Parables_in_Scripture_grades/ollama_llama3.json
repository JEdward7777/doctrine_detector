  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, specifically highlighting Nathan's strategic approach in confronting King David. The writer effectively summarizes the story from 2 Samuel 12, explaining how Nathan used the parable to convict David without directly accusing him. The analysis also shows a good understanding of the significance of David's realization of his own sin and his subsequent repentance.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give this response a perfect score is that it could be expanded upon with more depth and detail. For example, the writer could explore further how Nathan's use of a parable allowed David to engage with the story on a deeper moral level, or discuss how this narrative illustrates God's desire for correction, forgiveness, and restoration.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a clear and insightful analysis of Nathan's use of a parable, demonstrating a strong understanding of the concern."
