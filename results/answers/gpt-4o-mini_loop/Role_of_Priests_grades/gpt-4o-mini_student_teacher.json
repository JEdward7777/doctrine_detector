  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed answer outlining the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament based on biblical references. They accurately highlighted the various roles priests played in maintaining the spiritual life of Israel. However, the student's answer was a bit lengthy and included additional details beyond the specified concern of understanding the biblical role of priests. Streamlining the response to focus specifically on the key responsibilities would have improved the clarity and conciseness of the answer."
