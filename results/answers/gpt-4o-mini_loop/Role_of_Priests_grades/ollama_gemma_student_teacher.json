  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the priestly responsibilities in the Old Testament. It provides detailed explanations of various duties, referencing relevant biblical passages. The clarity and organization of the response are commendable. However, including a brief mention of the priesthood's role in mediating between the people and God would further strengthen the answer."
