  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85%\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, covering the key aspects of sacrifice, ritual, teaching, and intercession. While it does not delve deeply into specific biblical passages or provide detailed explanations, it correctly identifies the primary roles of priests as outlined in Scripture.\n\nThe answer provided as a reference point is also partially correct, as offering sacrifices and performing religious rites are indeed part of a priest's responsibilities. However, it oversimplifies the role by not mentioning teaching God's laws, maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple, or determining clean and unclean status. The response being graded does a better job of summarizing the diverse range of tasks priests performed to maintain the spiritual and communal life of Israel.\n\nTo improve this response, the writer could provide more specific biblical references and explanations for each responsibility, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the priestly role within its covenantal context."
