## [Answer](../Role_of_Priests.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Old Testament, the main responsibilities of priests were outlined in several books, particularly Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. Here are the key responsibilities:

1. **Sacrificial Offerings**: Priests conducted animal sacrifices and offerings on behalf of the people, including burnt offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings (Leviticus 1-7). They ensured these sacrifices were performed according to God's established guidelines to maintain holiness in worship.

2. **Maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple**: Priests oversaw the care and maintenance of the Tabernacle (and later the Temple), ensuring that it remained holy and suitable for worship (Exodus 25-30; 1 Chronicles 9:23).

3. **Teaching the Law**: Priests were responsible for instructing the people of Israel in God’s laws and commandments. They served as spiritual leaders, ensuring adherence to the covenant requirements (Deuteronomy 33:10; Leviticus 10:10-11).

4. **Performing Rituals**: Priests conducted various necessary rituals, including the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) ceremonies, which involved making atonement for the sins of the people (Leviticus 16).

5. **Intercession**: Acting as intermediaries between God and the people, priests prayed for the community, offered incense, and performed rites that sought God’s favor (Exodus 30:7-8; Numbers 6:22-27).

6. **Blessing the People**: Priests pronounced blessings over the Israelites, notably the Aaronic blessing (Numbers 6:24-26), which reaffirmed God's presence and favor in their lives.

7. **Purification and Cleansing**: They were involved in determining the clean and unclean status of individuals and objects, administering rituals for restoration and cleanliness (Leviticus 11-15).

These roles underscored the vital significance of priests in maintaining the spiritual and communal life of Israel, serving both God and the people within their covenant relationship.
