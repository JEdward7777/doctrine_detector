The primary role of a prophet in the Bible is to serve as a spokesperson for God, fulfilling several key responsibilities:

1. **Communication of God's Message**: Prophets are called to convey messages from God to the people. This includes delivering warnings, encouragement, guidance, and revelations about future events as instructed by God (Isaiah 6:8-10, Jeremiah 1:4-10).

2. **Calling for Repentance**: Many prophets were sent to urge the people to return to God, calling them to repent from their sins and abandon idolatry (Ezekiel 18:30, Jonah 3:4).

3. **Intercession**: Prophets often acted as intermediaries between God and the people, interceding on behalf of the nation or individuals in prayer (Exodus 32:11-14, Jeremiah 15:1).

4. **Forth-telling and Fore-telling**: Prophets engaged in both forth-telling, proclaiming God’s truth, and fore-telling, revealing future events as ordained by God. This dual role is prominently featured in many prophetic writings throughout the Old and New Testaments (Daniel 2:28-29, Revelation 1:1).

5. **Witness to God’s Character**: Prophets reveal God's nature and character, demonstrating His holiness, justice, mercy, and love to the people (Micah 6:8, Habakkuk 2:14).

6. **Guidance for Leadership**: Prophets often provided counsel to kings and leaders, helping them make decisions that aligned with God's will and purpose (2 Samuel 12:1-7).

Overall, the authority of a prophet arises from their direct communication with God, and their primary purpose is to guide the hearts and minds of God's people towards Him, calling them to a deeper relationship with the Divine.
