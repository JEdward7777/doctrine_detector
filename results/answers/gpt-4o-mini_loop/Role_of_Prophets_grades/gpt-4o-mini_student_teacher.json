  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible. They have covered various aspects such as communication of God's message, calling for repentance, intercession, forth-telling and fore-telling, witness to God's character, and guidance for leadership. The student has incorporated relevant biblical references to support their points and has demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical role of prophets and their messages.\n\nThe only minor area for improvement is that the student could have emphasized more on the prophets' role in warning the people to turn away from sin and obey God, as this is the central theme of many prophetic messages in the Bible. Overall, the student has shown a solid grasp of the topic and provided a well-rounded answer."
