The response effectively addresses the concern by expanding on the role of prophets beyond just speaking God's messages, delving into the nuances of their interactions with God and the people. The Christian worldview is well-represented in emphasizing the prophets' connection to God and their role in guiding people towards a deeper relationship with Him."
