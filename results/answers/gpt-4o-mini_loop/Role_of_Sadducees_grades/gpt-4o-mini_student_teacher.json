  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish Temple system, encompassing various aspects such as temple administration, high priesthood, doctrinal beliefs, political alliances, and economic interests. They demonstrated a solid understanding of the historical context and religious leadership during the time of Jesus. However, they could have linked their answer more directly to the teacher's reference answer, which focused on the practical tasks of taking care of the temple complex and performing priestly duties. Overall, a well-researched and comprehensive response."
