The student provides well-articulated examples from the Gospels, Acts, and Paul's epistles, highlighting how Scripture reveals God's plan, validates the truth of Jesus Christ, and guides believers in evangelism. The response also acknowledges the importance of Scripture in the ongoing mission of the church to proclaim the Gospel. However, it could have benefited from including additional examples or elaborating on the significance of Scripture in shaping and transforming the lives of listeners."
