  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the role of witnesses in the New Testament regarding the life and resurrection of Jesus. They supported their points with relevant scripture references and expanded on various aspects of witnessing, including eyewitness testimony, resurrection witnesses, testimony by the apostles, witnessing through the Church, and transformative evidence. While the student's response was thorough and well-organized, they could have tied their explanation back more directly to the concern provided and emphasized the importance of personal faith testimony in witnessing for Christians."
