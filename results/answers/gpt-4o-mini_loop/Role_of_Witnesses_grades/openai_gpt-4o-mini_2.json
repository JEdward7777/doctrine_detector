It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how witnesses in the New Testament shared firsthand accounts of their experiences with Jesus, aligning with the call for Christians to witness their faith and share personal encounters with God. The only room for improvement could be a deeper exploration of the theological significance of witnessing for Christians beyond just sharing personal experiences."
