  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the unique responsibilities of the high priest compared to other priests in Israel. They effectively highlighted key aspects such as intercession, entering the Holy of Holies, wearing special garments, anointing and consecration, judicial authority, maintaining the cultic life, and teaching and guidance. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting these responsibilities to the significance of the high priest's role in the worship practices of Israel, as underscored in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
