  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed explanation of how God instructed the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath, they could have focused more on the direct command given in Exodus 16:22-30 to gather a double portion of manna on the sixth day in preparation for the Sabbath. The student does a good job explaining the significance of resting on the Sabbath and trusting in God's provision, but they could have tied it back more explicitly to the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands. The student does well to highlight the theological significance of manna as a symbol of God's provision and faithfulness, but could have emphasized the direct link to the command regarding the Sabbath in their analysis."
