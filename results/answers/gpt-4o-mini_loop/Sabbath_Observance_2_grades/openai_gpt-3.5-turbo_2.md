## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the biblical account found in Exodus 16, God instructed the Israelites on how to gather manna, especially regarding the Sabbath. The Israelites were to collect manna each morning during the six days of the week, gathering only enough for their daily needs. However, on the sixth day, they were commanded to gather a double portion, sufficient for two days. This was to ensure that they would have enough to eat on the Sabbath, which is a day of rest.

In Exodus 16:22-30, it states that the Israelites gathered a double portion on the sixth day, and Moses informed them that they would not find manna on the Sabbath (the seventh day). This command reflects God's intention for His people to rest on the Sabbath, paralleling His own rest after the creation. The observance of the Sabbath emphasizes the importance of keeping this day holy and dedicated to God.

The instructions regarding the gathering of manna also reveal a deeper theological significance. Manna served as a daily reminder of God’s unwavering provision and faithfulness. Each day, the Israelites depended on God for sustenance, and the miraculous nature of the manna—falling from heaven—was a testament to His care for them. On the Sabbath, by refraining from gathering, the Israelites were not only honoring God's command but were also reminded to trust in His provision for their needs.

Through this practice, the Sabbath became more than just a day of rest; it was a sacred time to reflect on God's goodness, sustenance, and the covenant relationship He shared with His people, reinforcing their reliance on Him for all aspects of life.
