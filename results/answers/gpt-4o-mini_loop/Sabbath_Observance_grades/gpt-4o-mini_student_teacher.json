They referenced relevant Scriptures and elaborated on the significance of resting on the Sabbath, gathering for worship, reflecting on God's creation, promoting social justice, and acknowledging the shift to Sunday observance in light of Christ's resurrection. However, the answer may have delved too deeply into specific details and interpretations rather than focusing on the core concept of refraining from work and dedicating the day to rest and worship, as outlined in the reference answer."
