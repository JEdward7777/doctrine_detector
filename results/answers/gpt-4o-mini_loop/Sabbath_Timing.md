## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath (Shabbat) begins at sunset on Friday evening and lasts until sunset on Saturday evening. This timing is based on the biblical account of creation found in Genesis 1, where it states, "And there was evening, and there was morningâ€”the first day" (Genesis 1:5). This establishes the foundational understanding that a day in Jewish tradition runs from evening to evening, rather than from midnight to midnight as seen in the Gregorian calendar.

The importance of the Sabbath is emphasized in various parts of Scripture, including the Fourth Commandment, which instructs believers to "remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8). The timing of the Sabbath is essential in maintaining this observance and dedication to rest and worship.

The exact times for the beginning and end of Shabbat can vary depending on geographical location and the time of year, as they are determined by the time of sunset. Observant Jews often utilize prayer books or guides, known as "calendars" or "zmanim," to ascertain the specific times for their locality. This practice not only demonstrates obedience to God's command but also fosters community and continuity within the Jewish faith, as families gather to welcome the Sabbath together.
