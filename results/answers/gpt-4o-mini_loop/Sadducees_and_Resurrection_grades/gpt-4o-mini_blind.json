  "grade_comment": "Grade: 93\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and accurate comparison between the beliefs of the Sadducees and Christian teachings regarding resurrection. The student effectively highlights the foundational nature of Jesus' resurrection in Christian faith and the contrast with the Sadducees' denial of such beliefs. The incorporation of relevant biblical references, such as 1 Corinthians 15:20-22, enhances the theological depth of the explanation. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
