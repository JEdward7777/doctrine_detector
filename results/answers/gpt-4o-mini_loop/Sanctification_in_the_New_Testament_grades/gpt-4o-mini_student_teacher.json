  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the sanctification process for believers in Jesus as described in the New Testament, there is a slight deviation from the emphasis on faith in their explanation. The student does mention the role of faith in passing, particularly in the positional sanctification aspect, but could have expanded more on the essential role of faith in the believer's journey of sanctification. Without a clearer emphasis on the centrality of faith, the response slightly deviates from the specified concern. Nonetheless, the student demonstrates a deep understanding of the sanctification process as described in the New Testament and provides thorough Scriptural references to support their points."
