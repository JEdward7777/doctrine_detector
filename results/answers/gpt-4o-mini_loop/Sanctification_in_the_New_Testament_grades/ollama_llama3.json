  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and biblically grounded explanation of the New Testament's teaching on sanctification, covering positional, progressive, and ultimate aspects of this process. While it does not explicitly mention faith as the means by which believers are positioned for sanctification at conversion, it does emphasize the role of the Holy Spirit in leading believers to will and act according to God's good purpose (Philippians 2:12-13). The response also highlights the importance of individual responsibility and community accountability in the sanctification journey. However, a more direct connection between faith and sanctification at conversion would strengthen this answer, which is why it does not receive a perfect score."
