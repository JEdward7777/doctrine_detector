  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provided a detailed and comprehensive explanation regarding the term \"sanctuary\" in the Biblical context. They successfully connected the term to both physical structures like the Tabernacle and Temple and spiritual concepts like refuge in God. The student also effectively highlighted the significance of sanctuary in both the Old Testament and its relevance in contemporary Christianity. The only minor improvement could be a direct mention of the term denoting a location providing protection as stated in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the term 'sanctuary' in the Biblical context."
