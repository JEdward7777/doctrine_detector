In the Old Testament, God described the sanctuary as a sacred place where His presence dwelled among His people, the Israelites. The sanctuary, often referred to as the Tabernacle before the construction of the Temple, was designed to be a dwelling place for God among His people.

In Exodus 25:8, God commands, "And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst." This verse highlights God's deep desire to be close to His people, establishing a personal relationship with them and providing a dedicated space for worship and sacrifice. The detailed design of the sanctuary, including its specific materials and furnishings, was given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25-31), underscoring the sacredness of the space and the holiness required to approach God.

The sanctuary served several significant purposes:

1. **Presence of God**: It represented the Shekinah, the manifest presence of God among His people. The Ark of the Covenant, located in the Most Holy Place, was viewed as God's throne on earth.

2. **Worship and Sacrifice**: The sanctuary was the central location for the Israelites to offer sacrifices, conduct worship, and seek atonement for sin in accordance with the Levitical laws.

3. **Covenant Relationship**: It physically embodied the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Through the rituals performed there, the people expressed their commitment to God and affirmed His laws.

4. **Access to God**: Although access to the sanctuary was primarily reserved for the priests and specifically the High Priest during designated times, it symbolized Godâ€™s provision for a relationship with His people, highlighting both His holiness and the necessity of atonement.

In summary, the sanctuary was a vital aspect of the religious life of the Israelites. It symbolized God's desire for intimacy with His people and facilitated their interaction with Him through worship and sacrifice. This sacred space was foundational to their identity as God's chosen people, emphasizing the importance of holiness, reverence, and community in their relationship with the Lord.
