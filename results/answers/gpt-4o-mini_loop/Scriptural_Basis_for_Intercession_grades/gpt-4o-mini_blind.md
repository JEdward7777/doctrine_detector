The practice of interceding for others is a significant aspect of Christian theology and is supported by several Bible verses. Here are some key passages that provide insights into this practice:

1. **Job 42:10**: "And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job when he had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before." This verse highlights the power of Job's intercession for his friends and the blessings that followed.

2. **Exodus 32:11-14**: In this passage, Moses intercedes for the Israelites after they sinned with the golden calf. His passionate plea to God demonstrates how intercession can avert judgment and show God's mercy.

3. **Romans 8:34**: "Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us." This verse emphasizes Christ's active role as our intercessor, assuring believers of His continuous support.

4. **1 Timothy 2:1-2**: "First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way." This encourages believers to engage in prayer on behalf of others, emphasizing the importance of interceding even for those in authority.

5. **James 5:16**: "Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working." This verse underlines the communal aspect of prayer and the effectiveness of intercessory prayer in the context of mutual support.

6. **Psalm 106:23**: "Therefore he said he would destroy them—had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them." This illustrates Moses' essential role as an intercessor for Israel, showing how one person's prayer can impact the fate of many.

7. **Luke 22:32**: Jesus tells Peter, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail." Here, Jesus' personal intercession for Peter highlights His loving advocacy and the significance of prayers in spiritual struggles.

These verses collectively convey the importance and effectiveness of intercessory prayer in Scripture, reinforcing the notion that praying for others is a vital part of the Christian faith and showcases the profound impact of compassion and support in our spiritual journeys.
