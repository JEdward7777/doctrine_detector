  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of verses that illustrate the practice of interceding for others, they did not reference all the verses provided in the teacher's answer. Additionally, the response could have included a deeper exploration of the theological implications of intercessory prayer based on the selected verses. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and showcased a good selection of relevant Bible passages."
