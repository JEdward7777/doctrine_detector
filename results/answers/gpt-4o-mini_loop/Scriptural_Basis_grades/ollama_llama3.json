  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response successfully connects the theological concept of propitiation with biblical references, providing multiple verses that support the idea. The inclusion of four Bible verses (Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Hebrews 2:17) provides a comprehensive understanding of the concept. The explanation is clear and concise, demonstrating a deep understanding of the biblical material.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect the provided Bible verses to the original answer, highlighting how each verse specifically supports the idea that Jesus is the propitiation for our sins. This could strengthen the connection between the theological concept and the biblical references. Overall, however, this response effectively addresses the concern of connecting the concept with biblical references for deeper understanding."
