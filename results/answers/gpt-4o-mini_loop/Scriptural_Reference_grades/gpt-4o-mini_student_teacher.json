  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer, citing relevant biblical passages that address the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers. The student effectively highlighted the tension between living as a believer in a world with ungodly values and emphasized the importance of maintaining a Christian worldview. Additionally, the explanations provided in the response align well with a Christian perspective. Great job overall!"
