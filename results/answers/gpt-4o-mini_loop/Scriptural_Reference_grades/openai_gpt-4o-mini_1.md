## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The concept of the 'world' in relation to believers is addressed in several biblical passages, often highlighting the distinction between believers and the secular world, or the idea of living out one's faith in a culture that may not align with Christian values. Here are some key passages that address this concept:

1. **John 15:18-19**: Jesus says, "If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you." This passage emphasizes the separation between believers, chosen by Christ, and the secular world.

2. **Romans 12:2**: The Apostle Paul instructs believers, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect." Here, believers are urged to resist worldly influences and seek transformation through God's will.

3. **1 John 2:15-17**: This passage warns, "Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever." Believers are cautioned against worldly attachments and reminded of the temporary nature of worldly desires.

4. **James 4:4**: James writes, "You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God." This verse underlines the conflict between the values of the world and the requirements of faithfulness to God.

5. **Philippians 3:20**: Paul states, "But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ." This reflects the idea that believers belong to a different kingdom and have an eternal perspective that contrasts with earthly concerns.

6. **John 17:14-16**: In Jesus' high priestly prayer, He says, "I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world." This illustrates that while believers are in the world, they are not to be of it, and they rely on God for protection from evil.

These passages collectively convey that while believers live in the world, they are called to adopt a different mindset and lifestyle that reflects their faith in Christ, highlighting the tension between the values of the secular world and those of the kingdom of God. Believers are encouraged to be lights in a darkened world, exemplifying the truth and love of Christ in their interactions with others.
