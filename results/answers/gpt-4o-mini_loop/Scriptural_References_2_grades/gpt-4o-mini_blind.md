The concept of the Day of Judgment is well represented throughout the Bible, with several passages that highlight its significance in Christian theology. Here are key verses that support the idea of a final judgment:

1. **Matthew 25:31-46** - Jesus describes the final judgment where He will separate the righteous (the sheep) from the wicked (the goats), illustrating the essential truth that our lives and actions will have eternal consequences.

2. **2 Corinthians 5:10** - This verse reminds us that "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil," reinforcing that our deeds will be evaluated.

3. **Revelation 20:11-15** - This passage depicts the Great White Throne Judgment, where the dead are judged according to their works as recorded in the books, emphasizing God's fairness and justice.

4. **Romans 14:10-12** - Paul stresses the universality of judgment, stating, "we will all stand before the judgment seat of God," indicating that all individuals will be held accountable to God for their actions.

5. **Matthew 12:36-37** - Jesus emphasizes the gravity of our words by teaching that people will give an account for every careless word they utter, showing that even our speech plays a role in judgment.

6. **Acts 17:30-31** - Paul affirms that God has set a specific day for judging the world in righteousness, indicating the certainty and importance of this upcoming event.

7. **Hebrews 9:27** - This verse states, "And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment," highlighting the inevitability of facing judgment after this life.

These passages collectively demonstrate the Christian belief that all individuals will ultimately face a Day of Judgment, where their lives and choices will be appraised in the light of God's righteousness and holiness.
