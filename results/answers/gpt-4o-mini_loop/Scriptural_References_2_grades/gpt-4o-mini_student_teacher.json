  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nWhile the student provided an extensive list of biblical passages supporting the concept of the day of judgment, they missed referencing some key verses mentioned in the teacher's answer. The student's answer was thorough, well-explained, and showed a deep understanding of the topic. However, they could have benefited from including the specific verses mentioned by the teacher to align more closely with the given reference."
