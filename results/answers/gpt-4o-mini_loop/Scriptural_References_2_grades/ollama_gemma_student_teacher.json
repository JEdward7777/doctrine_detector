  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of the Day of Judgment and provides relevant biblical passages to support their claims. They clearly articulate the significance of individual accountability and the eternal consequences of actions. \n\nHowever, the grade could be improved by including more analysis of the passages provided and their connection to the concern of reinforcing the scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment. Additionally, including more verses from the reference answer provided by the teacher would strengthen the overall argument."
