  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid analysis of Matthew 23:27-28, drawing out key lessons about the nature of iniquity. The connection between external appearances and internal reality, the warning against hypocrisy, the portrayal of spiritual death, and the emphasis on repentance and transformation are all well-addressed. The response effectively highlights the foundational aspect of iniquity in the heart and the need for genuine alignment between faith and action. To enhance the grade, the student could deepen the scriptural references and theological insights tied to the nature of iniquity, emphasizing the importance of grace, sanctification, and the role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life."
