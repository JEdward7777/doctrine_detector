  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the shift in the New Testament's portrayal of Hades from a neutral place to one associated with judgment and the unrighteous. The student effectively cites relevant scripture passages and provides clear explanations of how each passage contributes to the overall understanding of this theological development. The response could have been enhanced by providing a bit more depth in the analysis of each passage, connecting them more explicitly to the broader theological context of the New Testament. Overall, a well-structured and insightful answer."
