  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of various New Testament passages that indicate a shift in understanding of Hades from a neutral place to one associated with the unrighteous. They effectively supported their points with specific verses and explanations. However, the reference answer from the teacher succinctly highlighted the key passages that demonstrate this shift, which the student could have emphasized more clearly in their response."
