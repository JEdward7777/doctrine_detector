  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively provides an in-depth analysis of various key passages from the New Testament that illustrate the evolving understanding of Hades in Christian theology. It delves into the shift from a more neutral concept of Hades to one associated with judgment and separation for the unrighteous, supported by scriptural evidence. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic within the context of Christian eschatology."
