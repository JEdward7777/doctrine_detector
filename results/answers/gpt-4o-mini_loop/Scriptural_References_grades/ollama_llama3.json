  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThis response accurately identifies the book (Genesis) and chapter (17:1) where God refers to Himself as \"Almighty\" in relation to Abraham, which meets the minimum requirement. The additional information about the significance of this title (\"El Shaddai\") also adds value to the response. However, it could be improved by providing more context or insight into how knowing this reference deepens our connection to Scripture and God's promises, as per the concern.\n\nThe grade of 80 reflects the response's accuracy and additional details, but deducts points for not fully addressing the concern about the significance of biblical references in deepening our connection with God."
