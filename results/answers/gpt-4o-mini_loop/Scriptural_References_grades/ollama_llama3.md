## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The book of the Bible that contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham is the book of Genesis. Specifically, in Genesis 17:1, God reveals Himself to Abraham as "El Shaddai," which is often translated as "God Almighty." This name signifies God's ultimate power and sovereignty, highlighting His ability to fulfill His promises to Abraham and his descendants.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

This response accurately identifies the book (Genesis) and chapter (17:1) where God refers to Himself as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham, which meets the minimum requirement. The additional information about the significance of this title ("El Shaddai") also adds value to the response. However, it could be improved by providing more context or insight into how knowing this reference deepens our connection to Scripture and God's promises, as per the concern.

The grade of 80 reflects the response's accuracy and additional details, but deducts points for not fully addressing the concern about the significance of biblical references in deepening our connection with God.
