  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the implications of Jesus' statement about the 'Son of Man' coming back on the clouds for believers. They have covered various theological aspects such as hope, divine authority, judgment, fulfillment of scripture, encouragement, and community. However, the student's response could have been more focused on directly addressing the concern and aligning more closely with the reference answer given by the teacher. The student's response could have been improved by concisely highlighting the key points that directly address the concern of Christian hope and eschatology."
