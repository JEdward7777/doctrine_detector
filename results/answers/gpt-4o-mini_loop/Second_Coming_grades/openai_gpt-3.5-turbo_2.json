  "grade_comment": "I would grade the response as 95. The student has done an excellent job in expanding upon the implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' for Christian hope and eschatology. They have thoroughly explored various theological implications such as hope and expectation, divine authority, judgment and accountability, fulfillment of Scripture, encouragement to persevere, and unity and community among believers. The response is well-supported with relevant biblical references and aligns well with a Christian worldview. Overall, this is a thoughtful and detailed analysis that effectively addresses the concern provided."
