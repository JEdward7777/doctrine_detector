According to biblical teachings, exalting oneself can lead to several spiritual and moral dangers. Here are some key points supported by Scripture:

1. **Pride Goes Before Destruction**: Proverbs 16:18 states, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." This verse warns that self-exaltation often results in downfall and tribulation.

2. **Humility is Valued**: The Bible frequently teaches that humility is essential. In James 4:6, it says, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." This emphasizes that self-exaltation not only displeases God but also hinders one from receiving His grace and blessings.

3. **Misalignment with Christ's Example**: Jesus taught and embodied humility (Philippians 2:5-8). Exalting oneself stands in stark contrast to the model Jesus set, choosing to serve rather than seeking personal glory.

4. **Separation from Others**: Self-exaltation fosters division and arrogance, impairing authentic community and fellowship. Romans 12:3 instructs believers not to think of themselves more highly than they ought, promoting a humble and accurate self-assessment in light of Christ.

5. **Lack of Dependence on God**: When individuals focus on exalting themselves, they risk relying solely on their own abilities rather than depending on God. Proverbs 3:5-6 encourages trust in the Lord with all one's heart, advising against leaning on personal understanding.

6. **Judgment from God**: Ultimately, those who exalt themselves may face divine judgment. Luke 14:11 states, "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted." This principle highlights that God determines who is honored and who is humbled.

7. **Failure to Witness to Others**: Self-exaltation can obstruct one’s ability to effectively share the Gospel. A Christian's witness is meant to reflect Christ, and an attitude of pride can create barriers to demonstrating the humility that embodies His message.

In summary, the dangers of exalting oneself include personal failure, a lack of grace from God, deviation from Christ’s example, potential isolation from the community, and the risk of divine judgment. Scripture consistently encourages a posture of humility and dependence on God, aligning with the teachings of Jesus and the nature of His kingdom.
