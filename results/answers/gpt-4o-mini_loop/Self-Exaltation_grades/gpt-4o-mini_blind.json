  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and well-supported explanation of the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings. The student effectively references various relevant Scriptures and connects them cohesively to convey the spiritual and moral implications of pride. The inclusion of practical implications such as separation from others and failure to witness effectively adds depth to the analysis. The response is doctrinally sound and effectively communicates the Christian perspective on this important topic. Great job!"
