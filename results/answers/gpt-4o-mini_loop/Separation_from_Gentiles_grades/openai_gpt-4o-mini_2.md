The Pharisees, a prominent religious group in Judaism during the Second Temple period, were concerned about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles for several theological and cultural reasons:

1. **Covenantal Identity**: The Jewish people understood themselves as God's chosen people, set apart by divine covenant. This identity was deeply rooted in their Scriptures, emphasizing obedience to God's laws and commands, which included being distinct from surrounding nations. 

2. **Holiness and Purity Laws**: The Torah contains numerous laws regarding ritual purity, dietary restrictions, and moral conduct. The Pharisees emphasized these laws as essential for maintaining the holiness of the community. Associating with Gentiles could risk ritual impurity and compromise the community’s fidelity to these divine mandates.

3. **Preservation of Faith and Practices**: The intermingling with Gentiles could lead to the assimilation of foreign beliefs and practices, potentially diluting Jewish faith and traditions. The Pharisees aimed to preserve the integrity of Jewish law and customs, viewing them as vital for the community’s survival and unwavering connection to God.

4. **Messianic Expectations**: During the time of Jesus, many Jews held strong messianic expectations. The Pharisees believed that adherence to the law and the maintenance of Jewish identity were crucial for the arrival of the Messiah. Mixing with Gentiles might have been perceived as undermining these eschatological hopes.

5. **Social and Political Context**: In a time of Roman occupation and diaspora, there was a heightened sense of vulnerability within the Jewish community. Separation from Gentiles served to reinforce a unified Jewish identity, providing strength against external challenges and preserving their distinctiveness in a complex world.

In summary, the Pharisees' concerns about separation stemmed from their desire to maintain Jewish religious identity, obedience to the law, and the community’s spiritual integrity amidst the complexities and pressures of their sociopolitical environment.
