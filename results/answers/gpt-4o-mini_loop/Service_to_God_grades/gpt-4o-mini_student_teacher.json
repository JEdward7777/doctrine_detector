The student incorporated key verses and themes that align with Christian beliefs on ministry. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern of actionable ways to engage in ministry, as outlined in the reference answer. The student covered a wide range of ministry activities but could have emphasized a few concrete actionable steps for Christians to take in their ministries to make the response more practical and focused."
