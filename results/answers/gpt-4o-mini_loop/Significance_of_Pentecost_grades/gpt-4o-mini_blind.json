The student effectively highlights key reasons such as the fulfillment of Jesus' promise, the birth of the Church, the empowerment of believers, the sign of God's new covenant, the unity and diversity of the Church, and the fulfillment of prophetic promises. The integration of relevant biblical references and theological insights enhances the depth of the response. Great job overall."
