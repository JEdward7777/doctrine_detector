  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively explains the significance of the Day of Pentecost in the New Testament. They address various key aspects such as the fulfillment of Jesus' promise, the birth of the Church, empowerment of believers, unity and diversity of the Church, and prophetic fulfillment. While the student's response expands on the teacher's reference answer by delving into additional details and relevant scriptures, their answer could have focused more specifically on the role of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers, as per the specified concern. Emphasizing the direct impact of the Holy Spirit on empowering believers for ministry and fulfilling Jesus' promise would have aligned more closely with the Christian worldview emphasis on the role of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives. Hence, the grade reflects the comprehensive response provided by the student but also considers the importance of addressing the specified concern in greater detail."
