  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 90/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of the Day of Pentecost from a Christian perspective. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers by highlighting the empowering and transformative nature of the Holy Spirit's presence on that day. The student's articulation of the event as the fulfillment of Jesus' promise and the birth of the Church is well-supported by textual references from Acts. The inclusion of broader theological concepts such as the new covenant and the universality of the Church adds depth and coherence to the response."
