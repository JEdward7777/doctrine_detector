The answer is well-supported with biblical references and effectively connects the significance of unleavened bread to purity, Christ's sinlessness, holiness, and transformation in a believer's life. The student effectively communicates the importance of unleavened bread in the context of the Christian faith and its symbolic representation. Great job overall!"
