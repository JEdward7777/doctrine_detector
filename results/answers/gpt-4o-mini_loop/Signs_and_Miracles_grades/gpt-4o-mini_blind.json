The answer effectively ties in relevant biblical references to support each point made, showcasing a strong understanding of the significance of miracles in the Christian faith. The student's analysis is thorough and aligns well with the central teachings of the New Testament regarding signs and wonders. However, to enhance the response further, they could have also included a brief mention of the distinction between authentic miracles from God and counterfeit miracles, as warned in Scripture (Matthew 7:21-23). Overall, a well-structured and insightful reflection on the topic."
