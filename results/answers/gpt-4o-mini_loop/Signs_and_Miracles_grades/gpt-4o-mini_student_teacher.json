  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured response that thoroughly explores the various roles signs and miracles play in validating God's message. They effectively incorporated biblical references and demonstrated a deep understanding of the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. The additional insights provided, such as the reflection of God's nature and the establishment of the early church, enrich the overall analysis. The response aligns closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, showcasing a solid grasp of the Christian worldview on this topic. A minor deduction is made for minor deviations from the reference answer in terms of conciseness, but overall, an excellent response."
