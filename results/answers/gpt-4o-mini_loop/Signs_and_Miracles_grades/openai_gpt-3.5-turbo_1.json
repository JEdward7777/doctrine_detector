It effectively expands on the original answer by delving into the multifaceted roles that signs and miracles play in affirming God's power, revealing His nature, provoking faith, illustrating spiritual truths, establishing the early church, and prefiguring the Kingdom of God. The integration of biblical references and the coherence of the discussion demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic and effectively addresses the concern at hand. Well done!"
