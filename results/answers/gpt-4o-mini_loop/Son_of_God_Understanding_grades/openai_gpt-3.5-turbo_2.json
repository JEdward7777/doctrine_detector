The explanation was well-supported with scriptural references and theological insights, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. The response effectively highlighted the theological implications of Jesus being the \"Son of God\" and how this title relates to His divine nature, Messiahship, intimate relationship with the Father, and role in revealing God to humanity."
