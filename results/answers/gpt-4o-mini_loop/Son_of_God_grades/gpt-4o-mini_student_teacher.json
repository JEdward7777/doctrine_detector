  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the distinction between the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus and the term 'sons of God' used for believers. They accurately highlight the differences in nature, eternal relationship, authority, role, purpose, and mission. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern of avoiding confusion in theological discussions. Nonetheless, the depth of analysis and accurate theological explanations warrant a high grade."
