  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student demonstrated a thorough understanding of the question and provided a detailed analysis of various interpretations of the term 'sons of God' in Genesis 6, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the reference answer from the teacher. The student could have clearly stated how the various interpretations discussed aligned with or differed from the teacher's reference answer. Integrating this comparison would have strengthened the response and demonstrated the student's ability to engage critically with the given content.\n\nOverall, the student's answer was well-researched, articulated, and covered a wide range of interpretations, showcasing a deep understanding of biblical exegesis."
