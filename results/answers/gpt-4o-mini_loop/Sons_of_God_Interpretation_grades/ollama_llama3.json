  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe student provides a clear summary of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, including the lineage of Seth, fallen angels, royalty or judges, and humanity. They also acknowledge that some scholars propose combining these views or taking a more nuanced approach.\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern about biblical interpretation, as they recognize that different interpretations can shape our understanding of scripture passages. The discussion of various theological implications for each interpretation is also well-done.\n\nOne area where the student could improve is by providing more depth and analysis of the biblical context and the theological themes involved. While they mention some of these themes briefly, a more detailed exploration would strengthen their argument.\n\nOverall, however, the response is strong, and I'm confident that with some further development, it could be even stronger!"
