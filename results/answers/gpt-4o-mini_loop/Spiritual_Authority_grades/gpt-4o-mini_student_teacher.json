  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively distinguishes between spiritual and earthly authorities based on Biblical teachings. The response references relevant scriptures and articulates the source, purpose, nature of governance, obedience, and accountability related to these authorities. The answer aligns well with a Christian worldview, acknowledging the importance of both types of authority while highlighting the unique roles they play in a believer's life. However, the direct biblical reference provided by the teacher in Ephesians 6:12 emphasizes a specific aspect of spiritual authorities not addressed in the student's response, which slightly impacts the overall completeness of the answer."
