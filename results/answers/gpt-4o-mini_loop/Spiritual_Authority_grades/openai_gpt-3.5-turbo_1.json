  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities in a Christian worldview, drawing from relevant biblical passages and providing detailed explanations. The inclusion of scriptural references enhances the credibility of the argument and reinforces the Christian perspective on obedience and accountability to both types of authorities. Overall, a well-written and insightful analysis. Great job!"
