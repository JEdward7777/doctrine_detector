  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned and detailed explanation of the role demons play in the deception of idolatry from a Christian worldview. They effectively tied in references from the New Testament and articulated how demons manipulate human desires and emotions to lead people astray from the truth of God. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly stating the core belief that only Yahweh is God, as emphasized in the reference answer. A stronger emphasis on the exclusivity of God's sovereignty would have further aligned the response with the specified concern."
