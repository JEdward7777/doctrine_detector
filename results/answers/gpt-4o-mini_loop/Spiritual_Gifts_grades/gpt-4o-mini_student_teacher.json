  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the implications of spiritual gifts as described in the Bible. They effectively address the diversity, source, purpose, responsibility, unity, discernment, and eschatological aspects of spiritual gifts, showcasing a strong understanding of the topic. However, there is a slight deduction for somewhat overcomplicating the explanation with theological interpretations that may not directly relate to the concern of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. Overall, the answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical concept of spiritual gifts."
