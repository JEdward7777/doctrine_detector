  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the concept of spiritual gifts, providing clear explanations and biblical support for each point. The writer effectively demonstrates their understanding of the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. The discussion is well-organized, with each point logically flowing from the previous one.\n\nThe only area where the response falls short is in its failure to explicitly address the concern about recognizing the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts. While the writer does mention the purpose of spiritual gifts as building up the church and serving others, they do not explicitly state that this is a crucial aspect for community growth and personal obedience. However, it can be inferred from their explanation that this is indeed an important consideration.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this response as it demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of spiritual gifts and provides clear biblical support for each point."
