  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of how confessing sins to one another contributes to spiritual healing in alignment with James 5:16. It effectively combines biblical references, theological insights, and practical applications. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively emphasizes the importance of confession within the context of community, accountability, and humility. The inclusion of 1 John 1:9 to highlight Christ as the ultimate mediator further strengthens the doctrinal correctness of the answer. Great job overall."
