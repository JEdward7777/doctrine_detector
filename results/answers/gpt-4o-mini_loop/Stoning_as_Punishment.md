## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery is primarily found in the Old Testament. In the Mosaic Law, specifically in Leviticus 20:10 and Deuteronomy 22:22-24, adultery is considered a serious offense deserving of the death penalty, which could be executed by stoning. These laws reflect a theocratic system in ancient Israel where civil and religious laws were closely intertwined, emphasizing communal purity and adherence to God's commandments.

Interpreting these passages requires an understanding of the context in which they were given. The harsh penalties were intended to maintain the holiness of the community of Israel and to deter serious crimes that could disrupt the social and moral fabric of society. Justice in this context emphasizes the seriousness of sin and its consequences while aiming to preserve the integrity of the community as God desired.

In the New Testament, the approach to sin and punishment shifts significantly. A notable example is found in John 8:1-11, where a woman caught in adultery is brought before Jesus. The accusers reference the Law of Moses, asking whether she should be stoned. Jesus responds, “Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.” This encounter highlights several key themes:

1. **Mercy and Repentance**: Jesus does not condemn the woman; instead, He encourages her to “go, and from now on sin no more” (John 8:11). This emphasizes the importance of repentance and the possibility of forgiveness, even for serious sins.

2. **Human Fallibility**: By reminding the accusers of their own sinfulness, Jesus underscores that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). No one is in a position to pass judgment without recognizing their own need for grace.

3. **God’s Justice and Mercy**: The balance of God's justice and mercy is beautifully illustrated in Jesus' response. While the law called for punishment, Jesus redirects the conversation to grace and the opportunity for transformation (Titus 3:5).

Additionally, in Matthew 5:17-18, Jesus states that He came not to abolish the Law but to fulfill it, highlighting that the heart of the law is to draw people closer to God rather than merely enforce punishment.

Consequently, stoning as a punishment for adultery serves as part of the Old Testament legal system but is recontextualized in the New Testament through the teachings of Jesus. This reflects a deeper understanding of God's justice not merely as strict punishment but as an expression of mercy that aims for restoration and relationship rather than retribution. As believers, this encourages us to consider how we extend both justice and mercy in our interactions with others, reflecting God's character in our lives.
