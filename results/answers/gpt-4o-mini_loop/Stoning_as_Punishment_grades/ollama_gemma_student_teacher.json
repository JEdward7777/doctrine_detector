They effectively analyze the context and purpose of these laws in the Old Testament legal system while acknowledging the shift in approach in the New Testament. The inclusion of relevant examples from John 8 and Matthew 5 highlights the balance between God's justice and mercy, emphasizing restoration and forgiveness rather than retribution."
