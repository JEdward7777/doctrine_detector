## [Answer](../Structure_of_the_Tabernacle.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Tabernacle, as described in the Book of Exodus in the Bible, was divided into two main sections: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place (also known as the Holy of Holies).

1. **The Holy Place**: This was the first section of the Tabernacle. Within the Holy Place, several important items were located:
   - **The Golden Lampstand (Menorah)**: This provided light in the Holy Place, symbolizing the light of Godâ€™s presence.
   - **The Table of Showbread**: This held twelve loaves of bread, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, which were renewed every Sabbath as a sign of God's provision.
   - **The Altar of Incense**: This was used for burning incense, symbolizing the prayers of the people rising to God and reflecting the worship and devotion of the Israelites.

2. **The Most Holy Place (Holy of Holies)**: This was the innermost section of the Tabernacle, separated from the Holy Place by a thick veil. The Most Holy Place contained:
   - **The Ark of the Covenant**: This sacred chest housed the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod that budded, and a pot of manna. The Ark represented God's presence among His people and was topped with the Mercy Seat, where God was believed to dwell in a unique way, signifying His holiness and the divine covenant with Israel.

Access to the Most Holy Place was reserved exclusively for the High Priest, and only on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This restriction highlighted the holiness of God and the necessity for atonement for sin, emphasizing the importance of reconciliation between God and humanity.
