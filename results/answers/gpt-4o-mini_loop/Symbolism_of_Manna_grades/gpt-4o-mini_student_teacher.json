  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of how manna symbolizes God's provision, addressing various theological concepts such as divine provision, dependence on God, spiritual nourishment, God's faithfulness, and preparation for the Promised Land. The response effectively communicates the significance of manna in the biblical narrative and its implications for believers. However, the student could have linked their explanation more directly to the concern of recognizing God's ongoing provision in the lives of believers, as stated in the prompt, to further strengthen their answer."
