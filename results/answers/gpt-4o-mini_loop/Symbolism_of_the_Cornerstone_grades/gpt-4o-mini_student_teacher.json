  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained analysis of the metaphor of the cornerstone in relation to Jesus and His followers. The answer effectively highlighted various aspects such as foundation, unity, strength, acceptance, and purpose. The student's response aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer, but it could have been more concise and focused specifically on the source of strength and reference point aspects emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a strong understanding of the metaphor was demonstrated."
