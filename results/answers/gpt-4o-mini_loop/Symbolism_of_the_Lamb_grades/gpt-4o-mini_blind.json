The student effectively connects key Biblical narratives, theological concepts, and the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ. The explanation is comprehensive, coherent, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the doctrinal significance of the sacrificial system in both the Old and New Testaments. Well done!"
