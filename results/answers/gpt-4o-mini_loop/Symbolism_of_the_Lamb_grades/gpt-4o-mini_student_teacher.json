  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the significance of using a lamb for sacrifices in the Bible and its relation to atonement. They effectively incorporated key points such as the symbolism of innocence and purity, the Passover lamb, atonement and substitution, foreshadowing Christ, and the New Covenant. The student's answer significantly expands on the reference answer by delving into various theological aspects and providing scriptural references to support their points. However, there were some areas where the explanation could have been more concise and focused, leading to a slight deduction in points. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
