The integration of relevant Scripture helps support the points made. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the distinctiveness of the church as the body of Christ compared to the synagogue, highlighting the fulfillment of Old Testament foreshadowing in Jesus Christ. Additionally, a more explicit connection to Christian theology and doctrine, such as the role of the Holy Spirit in the church and the sacraments, would enhance the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
