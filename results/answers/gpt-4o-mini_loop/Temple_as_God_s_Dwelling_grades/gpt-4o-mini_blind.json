  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and thoughtful exploration of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively outlines the significance of the Tabernacle, Solomon's Temple, Jesus as the ultimate temple, and the church as the temple of God. The inclusion of New Testament passages and the eschatological vision from Revelation adds depth to the response. The student demonstrates a strong understanding of how this theme progresses and culminates in the greater revelation of God's desire to dwell among His people. Overall, a well-structured and doctrinally sound answer."
