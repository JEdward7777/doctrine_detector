  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed analysis of how the concept of the temple as God's dwelling is expressed in both the Old and New Testaments, incorporating key biblical references and theological insights. They have effectively explored the transition from the physical temple structures to Jesus Christ and believers as the temple of God. However, while their response is thorough, it could have been strengthened by directly contrasting it with the reference answer provided by the teacher to ensure a more precise alignment with the Christian-specific theological implications of God dwelling among His people."
