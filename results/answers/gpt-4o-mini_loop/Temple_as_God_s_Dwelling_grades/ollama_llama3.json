  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response effectively explores the concept of God dwelling among His people, tracing the evolution from the physical temple in the Old Testament to the person of Jesus Christ and the collective body of believers in the New Testament. The discussion is well-organized and provides relevant biblical support for each point.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of highlighting the theological implications of God's presence among His people, emphasizing the covenant relationship between God and Israel, as well as the intimacy and restoration promised through Jesus Christ and the church.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could further develop the eschatological vision presented in Revelation 21:22, exploring how this future reality relates to our current understanding of God's presence among His people. Additionally, some biblical references could be more explicitly tied to the concern about exploring the theological implications of God dwelling among His people.\n\nOverall, a solid effort that demonstrates a good grasp of the topic and its biblical foundations!"
