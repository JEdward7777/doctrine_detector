The detailed explanation of the evolution of this concept from physical structures to spiritual realities is insightful and aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the intimate relationship God desires to have with His people. The inclusion of scriptural references and the eschatological hope further enriches the response, demonstrating a thorough analysis within a Christian framework."
