  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, tracing the concept from the Old Testament Temple to Jesus Christ and believers in the New Testament. The incorporation of scriptural references and the progression of the temple concept over time within the biblical narrative align well with the question's concern. Additionally, the response effectively highlights the intimate relationship between God and His people through the temple imagery."
