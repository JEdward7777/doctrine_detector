## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Gospel accounts, particularly in Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13, Jesus responds to the temptations presented by Satan with profound wisdom and a steadfast adherence to God's will. After fasting for 40 days, Jesus encounters three specific temptations:

1. **Turning Stones to Bread**: Satan tempts Jesus to use His divine power to satisfy His hunger. Jesus responds by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3, stating, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." This response emphasizes His complete reliance on God's provision, illustrating that spiritual nourishment is far more vital than mere physical sustenance.

2. **Testing God by Jumping from the Temple**: In this temptation, Satan challenges Jesus to throw Himself from the pinnacle of the Temple, insisting that angels would rescue Him. Jesus counters by quoting Deuteronomy 6:16, saying, "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test." Here, Jesus affirms the importance of trusting in God without demanding miraculous signs for assurance of His presence and protection.

3. **Worshiping Satan for Earthly Power**: Lastly, Satan offers Jesus dominion over all the kingdoms of the world in exchange for worship. Jesus replies with a powerful declaration from Deuteronomy 6:13, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve." This response signifies His unwavering commitment to worshiping God alone, outright rejecting the temptation to gain power and glory through sinful means.

Through these encounters, Jesus exemplifies unwavering obedience to Godâ€™s Word and a deep understanding of His purpose. His responses not only reveal His character and authority but also serve as a model for believers, illustrating the necessity of grounding oneself in Scripture, trusting in God's faithfulness, and prioritizing spiritual devotion over worldly gains. Ultimately, Jesus' victory over temptation reaffirms His role as the faithful Son of God, equipping believers to stand firm against their own temptations.
