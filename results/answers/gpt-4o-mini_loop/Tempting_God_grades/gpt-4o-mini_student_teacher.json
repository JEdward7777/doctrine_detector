  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of tempting God. They effectively referenced relevant biblical passages and provided clear examples of how one can tempt God in various ways. The student also accurately highlighted the seriousness of this behavior and its potential consequences. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly connecting the consequences mentioned back to the idea of divine punishment as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, this response shows a commendable grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview."
