  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that goes beyond the reference answer by including various terms used in different Christian traditions to refer to the Lord's Supper. The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the significance and nuances of each term within the Christian context. However, the response could have been further strengthened by explicitly connecting each term to its theological implications and relevance within Christian worship practices."
