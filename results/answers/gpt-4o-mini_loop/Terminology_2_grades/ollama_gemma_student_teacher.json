  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the various terms used in Christian communities to refer to the Lord's Supper. It provides a well-organized and informative overview of the different terms and their theological significance. The inclusion of references to the biblical accounts and different denominations' perspectives adds depth and nuance to the response. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher only includes two terms, which limits the scope of the assessment."
