  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and detailed explanation of various terms used within Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper, demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic. The incorporation of multiple perspectives and traditions enhances the insight provided in the response. The only area for improvement would be to directly connect each term mentioned in the response back to the terms 'communion' and 'Last Supper' provided in the original answer."
