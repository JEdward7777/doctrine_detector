  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive list of alternative terms to describe a deacon, showing a strong understanding of the various ways to identify service roles within the church. The additional terms they included beyond the reference answer demonstrate a thorough exploration of the topic. The student also appropriately acknowledged the diversity of terminology across Christian denominations. Overall, this answer shows an excellent grasp of the concept and provides valuable insights into the different perspectives on the role of a deacon within Christian contexts."
