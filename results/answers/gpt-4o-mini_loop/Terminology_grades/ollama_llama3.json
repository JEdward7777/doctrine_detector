The concern is about recognizing various ways to identify service roles within the church, which the response partially addresses but could have delved deeper into.\n\nThe original text provides a more comprehensive list of alternative terms for \"deacon,\" including \"Servant,\" \"Minister,\" \"Helper,\" \"Elder,\" \"Church Worker,\" and \"Coordinator.\" This broader range of terms showcases the diversity of perspectives on the role of deacons across different Christian denominations, which aligns with the concern."
