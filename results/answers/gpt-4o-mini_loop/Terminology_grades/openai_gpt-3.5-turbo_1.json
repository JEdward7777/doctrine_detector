The provided list of alternative terms for \"deacon\" demonstrates an understanding of the rich and diverse terminology used within Christian contexts. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a more explicit mention of the term \"helper\" and \"servant-leader\" from the original list in addition to the terms stated in the response."
