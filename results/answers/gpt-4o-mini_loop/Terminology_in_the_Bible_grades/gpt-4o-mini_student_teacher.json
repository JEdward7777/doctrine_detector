  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer, demonstrating a clear understanding of the terms and their significance in the Biblical context. However, the teacher's reference answer specifically mentioned \"Hebrews\" as one of the terms used interchangeably, which was not included in the student's response. Otherwise, the student's explanation was detailed and well-supported from a Christian worldview."
