## [Answer](../Terminology_in_the_Bible.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The three terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible are "Israel," "the Jews," and "the children of God."

1. **Israel** refers to both the ancient nation descended from Jacob (who was renamed Israel) and, in a broader theological sense, encompasses the spiritual descendants of Abraham. This includes all who place their faith in Christ, signifying a shift from physical lineage to a spiritual family.

2. **The Jews** specifically denotes the descendants of the tribe of Judah, as well as those who adhere to the Jewish faith and culture, particularly after the Babylonian exile. This term highlights the historical and religious identity that has persisted through the centuries.

3. **The children of God** emphasizes the relational aspect of believers with God. This term not only identifies the people of Israel but also extends to all who have faith in Jesus Christ, thus incorporating both Jews and Gentiles into God's family through faith.

These terms illustrate different dimensions of God's covenant relationship with His people throughout scripture, distinguishing between the physical lineage of Israel and the spiritual lineage created through faith in Jesus.
