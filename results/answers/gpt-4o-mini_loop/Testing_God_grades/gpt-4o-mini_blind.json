The inclusion of scriptural references, the emphasis on faith, the discussion of God's nature, the examination of heart motives, the consideration of presumption, and the consequences in a believer's life are all well articulated and grounded in Christian doctrine. The explanation is clear, cohesive, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological principles involved. Great job!"
