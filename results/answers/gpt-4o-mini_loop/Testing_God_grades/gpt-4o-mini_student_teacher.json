  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns with Christian teachings on not putting God to the test. They effectively referenced Scripture and highlighted key theological points related to faith, trust, God's nature, and the importance of humility in our relationship with Him. The explanation was clear and thorough, demonstrating a strong grasp of the topic. The only suggestion for improvement would be to tie the answer back directly to the concern of maintaining a proper relationship with God, as mentioned in the reference answer."
