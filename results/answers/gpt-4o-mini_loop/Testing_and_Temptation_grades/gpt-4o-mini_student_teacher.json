  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated explanation of the differences between testing and temptation in a biblical context, supported by relevant scripture references. They clearly distinguished the purposes and implications of testing and temptation, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is for straying slightly from the concise wording of the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the spiritual discernment needed to differentiate between testing and temptation."
