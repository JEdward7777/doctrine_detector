  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response accurately identifies the Great Commission given by Jesus to His disciples before ascending to heaven, as recorded in Matthew 28:18-20. The student effectively conveys the importance of evangelism and discipleship in the Christian faith. The only minor issue is the slight expansion beyond the specific wording of the reference answer, but the core message aligns well with the Christian worldview."
