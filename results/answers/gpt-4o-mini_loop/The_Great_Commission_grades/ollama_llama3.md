Before ascending to heaven, Jesus gave His disciples the Great Commission, which is recorded in Matthew 28:18-20. In this passage, Jesus instructs His disciples to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe all that He has commanded. He promises to be with them always, even to the end of the age. This command highlights the vital role of evangelism and discipleship in the Christian faith, calling believers to actively share the gospel and nurture new followers of Christ.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The student has accurately summarized the main points of the Great Commission, including Jesus' instruction to make disciples of all nations, baptize them, and teach them to obey everything He had commanded. They have also correctly identified the importance of evangelism and discipleship in the Christian faith.

However, there is room for improvement in terms of depth and nuance. The student's response is somewhat superficial, lacking any meaningful analysis or reflection on the significance of the Great Commission in the broader context of Christian mission and discipleship. Additionally, the language used is straightforward but lacks theological precision, which might be a concern.

Overall, I would say that this response demonstrates a good understanding of the basics of the Great Commission, but could benefit from more attention to depth and theological sophistication.

Comment: The student has done a good job of summarizing the main points of the Great Commission, but could take their response to the next level by exploring the implications and significance of Jesus' command in greater depth.
