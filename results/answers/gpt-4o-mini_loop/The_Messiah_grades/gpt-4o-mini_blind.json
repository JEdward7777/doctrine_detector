The answer effectively highlights the distinction between the personal name \"Jesus\" and the title \"Christ,\" emphasizing the significance of both in understanding Jesus's identity as the Son of God and the Messiah. The explanation is clear and doctrinally sound, demonstrating a solid understanding of the theological concepts involved. Great job!"
