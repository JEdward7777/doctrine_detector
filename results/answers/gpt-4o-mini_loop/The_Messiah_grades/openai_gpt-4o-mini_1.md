## [Answer](../The_Messiah.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The terms "Jesus" and "Christ" are closely related yet carry distinct meanings.

"Jesus" is a personal name derived from the Hebrew name "Yeshua," which translates to "Yahweh saves" or "God is salvation." This name identifies the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth, who is central to Christianity as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity.

Conversely, "Christ" is a title that originates from the Greek word "Christos," which is the equivalent of the Hebrew word "Moshiach" or "Messiah," meaning "the anointed one." In Jewish tradition, the Messiah is anticipated to be a deliverer and a king, destined to save and restore Israel and, ultimately, the world.

By referring to "Jesus Christ," we recognize both His historical identity as Jesus of Nazareth and His role as the anointed Messiah. Christians believe that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah through His life, death, and resurrection, establishing Him not merely as a prophet or teacher, but as the divine Savior. Therefore, "Jesus" highlights who He is in a personal and historical context, while "Christ" underscores His messianic role and divine mission.
