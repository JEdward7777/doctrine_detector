  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of prayer in a Christian context and effectively distinguishes between praying to the one true God and talking to a false god. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of Christian theology and effectively uses scripture to support their points. The explanation is well-structured and presents the information in a coherent and doctrinally sound manner. Great work overall!"
