  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe answer provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of what it means for God to write His law on the hearts of His people in the New Covenant. The student effectively explains the theological significance of this concept, touching on key points such as internalization of God's will, intimacy of relationship, empowerment through the Holy Spirit, universal access, and transformation of lives. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references adds depth to the analysis.\n\nHowever, to improve the response, the student could strengthen the doctrinal connections by explicitly referencing how Jesus Christ fulfilled the New Covenant through His sacrificial death and resurrection, as well as emphasizing the centrality of Christ in enabling believers to live out God's commandments.\n\nOverall, this is a strong answer that demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview."
