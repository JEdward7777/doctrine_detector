It effectively highlights the theological truths underlying this transition and how it fosters a transformative relationship with God. The response could be enhanced by referencing specific Old Testament laws or practices that contrast with the principles of the New Covenant to further illustrate the shift in emphasis from external regulations to internal transformation."
