The scriptural references and theological connections are strong, showing a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The emphasis on union with Christ, eschatological fulfillment, transformation and holiness, participation in Christ's glory, and hope and assurance is commendable. The explanation is clear, doctrinally sound, and enriching. Great job!"
