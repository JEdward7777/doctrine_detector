In New Testament theology, the concept of believers being glorified with Christ signifies the profound reality of sharing in Christ's divine glory and honor, especially in the context of eschatology. This glorification is intricately linked to several key themes:

1. **Union with Christ**: Believers are united with Christ through faith (Romans 6:5), which indicates that, just as Christ was raised from the dead and exalted, so too will believers experience this resurrection and future glorification. The Apostle Paul emphasizes this union in Romans 8:17, where he states that believers are "heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him." This highlights not only the shared inheritance but also the importance of participating in Christ's sufferings as part of the journey toward glorification.

2. **Eschatological Fulfillment**: The glorification of believers has an eschatological dimension, pointing toward the transformative event of Christ's second coming. At that time, believers will be fully transformed, receiving glorified bodies akin to Christ’s own resurrected body (1 Corinthians 15:42-44, Philippians 3:20-21). This future promise affirms that believers will be entirely conformed to the image of Christ, culminating in the full revelation of God's glory.

3. **Transformation and Holiness**: Glorification reflects the completion of the sanctification process. In Romans 8:30, Paul indicates that those whom God predestines He also calls, justifies, and glorifies, suggesting that glorification is the final act of God's redemptive work in believers' lives. At this stage, they will be fully and finally made righteous, wholly transformed to reflect God's holiness.

4. **Participation in Christ's Glory**: The New Testament also teaches that believers should actively reflect Christ's glory in their earthly lives. This truth is beautifully captured in 2 Corinthians 3:18, where Paul notes that believers, "with unveiled faces," reflect the Lord's glory and are being transformed into His likeness. Thus, this reflection of Christ’s glory is not merely a future hope but a present calling, empowering believers to embody His character in their everyday lives.

5. **Hope and Assurance**: The anticipation of glorification provides profound hope and encouragement for believers. Romans 8:18 declares that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed to believers. This future hope acts as a source of strength during trials, assuring believers that their ultimate victory and glorification with Christ is certain.

In summary, being glorified with Christ assures believers of their future transformation into a state of complete holiness and glory. This entails sharing in Christ’s resurrection and eternal life, encouraging them to live in a manner worthy of their calling and to reflect Christ’s character and glory in their lives today. The work of Christ is foundational to this hope, for it is through His sacrifice and triumph over death that believers are granted this glorious future.
