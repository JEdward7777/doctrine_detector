  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-structured and comprehensive explanation of the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible and its relation to New Testament teachings about sin and redemption. They have effectively highlighted the transition from Old Testament rituals to the ultimate spiritual cleansing through Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The inclusion of relevant scripture references enhances the theological depth of the response. One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the centrality of Christ's atoning sacrifice in the process of cleansing and redemption."
