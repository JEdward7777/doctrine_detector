  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and detailed analysis of how figures like Moses and King David were chosen by God and the implications of God's selection process. They effectively draw connections between the biblical narratives of Moses and David and the theological implications for the Christian community regarding God's sovereignty in appointing leaders. The student's answer is well-supported with relevant scriptural references and demonstrates a strong grasp of the concept. However, the answer could be improved by directly referencing the teacher's answer and mirroring its succinctness in presenting the main point without unnecessary elaboration."
