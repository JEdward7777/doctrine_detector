In the biblical narrative, figures like Moses and King David are considered 'chosen ones' because of their unique roles in God's redemptive plan for His people. Their selection exemplifies God's sovereign choice and serves to illustrate the criteria He uses when choosing individuals for specific tasks.

1. **Moses**: God chose Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage and to receive the Law on Mount Sinai. This pivotal moment is detailed in Exodus 3 and 4, where God appears to Moses in the burning bush and commissions him for the monumental task ahead. Moses’s initial hesitance and feelings of inadequacy—expressed in his concern about his speech—highlight that God's choice was based not on Moses's abilities but rather on God's purpose and power. This implies that God often selects individuals who may seem unlikely or unqualified to accomplish His will, emphasizing His grace and the glory of His work (Exodus 4:10-12).

2. **King David**: David was chosen by God to be king of Israel while he was still a shepherd, as narrated in 1 Samuel 16. His anointing by the prophet Samuel occurred after God rejected Saul as king due to his disobedience (1 Samuel 15:26-28). God's choice of David was based on the condition of his heart, as stated in 1 Samuel 16:7, which indicates that God looks beyond outward appearances or social status. This suggests that God's selection process values inward character and faithfulness over conventional measures of success, reinforcing the idea that "man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."

**Implications about God's selection process**:
- **Sovereignty and Purpose**: God's selection of leaders like Moses and David reveals His sovereignty and specific purpose for each person. His choices are aligned with His plans for His people and the unfolding of history (Romans 8:28).

- **Grace and Empowerment**: The calling of these individuals is a powerful demonstration of God's grace. He empowers those He chooses, irrespective of their initial qualifications or skills, to fulfill the divine tasks set before them (2 Corinthians 12:9).

- **Humility and Faith**: Both Moses and David exemplify qualities of humility and faith. Their journeys involved trials that shaped their characters, illustrating that God's chosen ones often undergo preparation and refinement (Hebrews 11:24-26).

- **Diversity in Choices**: God's chosen ones emerge from various backgrounds and life experiences, demonstrating that His purposes extend beyond human expectations and norms. He can raise leaders from the most unlikely places (1 Corinthians 1:27-29).

Ultimately, the stories of Moses and David emphasize that God's selection process is divine, purposeful, and reflective of His attributes, including grace, sovereignty, and an emphasis on the heart's condition. This provides profound insight into how God works through individuals to achieve His greater will and glorify His name.
