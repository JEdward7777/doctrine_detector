  "grade": 92.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 92.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the significance of the twelve apostles in Christian belief and ministry, going beyond just their role as chosen followers of Christ to discuss their foundational contributions to the early church, their testimony to Jesus' life and works, and their symbolic meaning. The discussion is well-organized, clear, and supported by biblical references.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are minor: some sentences could be condensed or rephrased for greater clarity, and there's an opportunity to further develop the point about the apostles' diversity of backgrounds as a reflection of Jesus' inclusive ministry. Nevertheless, this response effectively recognizes the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, making it a strong submission.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the apostles' significance in Christian theology and practice. With some minor tweaks to sentence-level clarity and further development of certain points, it could be even stronger."
