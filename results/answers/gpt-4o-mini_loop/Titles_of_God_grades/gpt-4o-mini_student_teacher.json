  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that goes beyond the given reference answer in explaining various titles that refer to God as 'Almighty' in both Hebrew and Greek terms. They effectively demonstrated how each title emphasizes different aspects of God's character and sovereignty. However, the student could have included the specific titles mentioned in the reference answer ('Almighty God', 'God Almighty', 'Lord Almighty', and 'Lord God Almighty') to align more closely with the provided answer."
