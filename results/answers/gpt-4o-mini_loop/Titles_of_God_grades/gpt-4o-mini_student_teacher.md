## [Answer](../Titles_of_God.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, several titles refer to God as 'Almighty,' underscoring His supreme power and sovereignty. Here are some notable examples:

1. **El Shaddai** - This Hebrew term, often translated as "God Almighty," emphasizes God's all-sufficient power and might. Its use in Genesis 17:1 and Exodus 6:3 highlights God's ability to fulfill His promises and provide abundantly for His people.

2. **Pantokrator** - This Greek term, meaning "Almighty" or "All-Powerful," is notably found in the New Testament, particularly in the book of Revelation (e.g., Revelation 1:8, Revelation 11:17). It conveys God's absolute authority over all things, reinforcing the belief that nothing is beyond His control.

3. **Yahweh Sabaoth** - Translated as "Lord of Hosts" or "Lord of Armies," this title signifies God's sovereignty over all heavenly and earthly armies. It reflects not only His power but also His readiness to defend His people and accomplish His purposes, as seen throughout the prophetic writings.

4. **The Almighty** - This title is explicitly used in various Bible verses, such as Job 23:16 and Revelation 21:22, to emphasize God's supreme authority and power. It serves as a reminder of His unwavering presence and strength in times of trouble and His ultimate control over the universe.

These titles illuminate different facets of God's character, deepening our understanding of His omnipotence and His role as a protector, provider, and sovereign ruler over all creation. Recognizing the significance of these names encourages believers to trust in His infinite power and presence in their lives.

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer that goes beyond the given reference answer in explaining various titles that refer to God as 'Almighty' in both Hebrew and Greek terms. They effectively demonstrated how each title emphasizes different aspects of God's character and sovereignty. However, the student could have included the specific titles mentioned in the reference answer ('Almighty God', 'God Almighty', 'Lord Almighty', and 'Lord God Almighty') to align more closely with the provided answer.
