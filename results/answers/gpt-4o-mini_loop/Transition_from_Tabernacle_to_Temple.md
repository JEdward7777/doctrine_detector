## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Israelites ceased using the tabernacle primarily due to the establishment of the permanent Temple in Jerusalem. The tabernacle, a portable sanctuary, was essential during the Israelites’ journey through the wilderness and into the Promised Land, serving as the dwelling place of God's presence and a center for worship (Exodus 25:8-9).

King David had a deep desire to build a permanent home for the Lord, recognizing that while he lived in a grand palace, the Ark of the Covenant remained in a tent (2 Samuel 7:2). However, God chose not to allow David to build the Temple because he had shed much blood in battle (1 Chronicles 22:8). Instead, it was his son Solomon who was divinely appointed to construct the Temple, which he built in Jerusalem around 960 BC (1 Kings 6:1).

Once the Temple was completed and dedicated, it took over the role of the tabernacle in Israelite worship. The Temple symbolized God's enduring presence with His people in a definitive location and was designed for permanent use, providing a more stable and grand environment for worship (1 Kings 8:10-11). This transition marked a significant shift in the worship practices of the Israelites, leading to the diminishing use of the tabernacle. Ultimately, the Temple became the central place of worship, fulfilling David’s vision and standing as a testament to God's faithfulness and covenant with His people (Psalm 132:13-14).
