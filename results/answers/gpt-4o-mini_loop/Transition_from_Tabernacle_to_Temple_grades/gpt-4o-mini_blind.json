  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of why the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle, focusing on the transition to the permanent Temple in Jerusalem. The student effectively cites relevant biblical passages to support their points and demonstrates an understanding of the theological significance of the tabernacle and Temple in Israelite worship. However, the response could be strengthened by delving deeper into the theological implications of this transition and highlighting the symbolic significance of the shift from the tabernacle to the Temple in God's plan for His people."
