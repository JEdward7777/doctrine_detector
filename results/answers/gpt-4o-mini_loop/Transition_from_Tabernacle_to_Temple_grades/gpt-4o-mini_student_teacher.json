  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple, incorporating relevant biblical references and historical context. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of the Temple in replacing the tabernacle as the central place of worship for the Israelites. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the question of why the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle instead of focusing solely on the establishment of the Temple."
