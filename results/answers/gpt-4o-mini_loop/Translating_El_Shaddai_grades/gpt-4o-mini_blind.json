The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the theological depth behind the name and how it is preserved across different linguistic contexts. The student effectively highlighted the common translations in different languages while emphasizing the consistency in conveying the attributes of God as \"God Almighty.\" Overall, a well-researched and well-presented response. Great job!"
