Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance and theological implications of the term "El Shaddai" in various languages, showcasing a deep understanding of the topic. However, the student missed the mark in addressing the concern of accurately representing God's name across different cultures and languages. The reference answer emphasized keeping the translation simple as "God Almighty" or "Shaddai" to ensure phonetic accuracy, which the student did not explicitly address. While the student's response was informative, it lacked the focus on linguistic accuracy and simplicity as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer.
