The theological implications, poetic and literary value, and identity and community aspects are well-explained with proper references to biblical context. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the divinely inspired nature of Scripture and the role of these terms in pointing towards Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of all God's promises."
