  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response, highlighting the cultural, theological, literary, and communal significance of retaining the terms 'Zion' and 'Daughter' in translations of Biblical texts. They effectively connected these terms to broader themes within Scripture and emphasized the importance of maintaining the original message's depth and richness. The response aligns closely with the concern of ensuring the spiritual and cultural significance of the original text is adequately conveyed. Great job in providing a thorough explanation and supporting points."
