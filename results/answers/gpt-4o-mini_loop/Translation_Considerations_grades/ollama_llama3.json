While it does not specifically mention spiritual significance, the discussion of these terms' connections to God's presence, redemption, salvation, and covenant community implies a deep understanding of their spiritual importance.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern about ensuring that translations convey the original text's spiritual and cultural significance, highlighting the significance of preserving the original terminology to maintain the depth and richness of Scripture. However, it would have been strengthened by more explicit language emphasizing the spiritual implications of these terms, which is reflected in the target answer. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of retaining these terms and provides convincing arguments for their preservation."
