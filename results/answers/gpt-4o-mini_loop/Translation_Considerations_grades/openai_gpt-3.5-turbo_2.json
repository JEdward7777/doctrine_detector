It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how these terms contribute to conveying the spiritual and cultural depth of the original text. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further explore how the retention of these terms aligns with Christian beliefs about the continuity of God's promises and the intimate relationship between God and His people. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of preserving these terms in Biblical translations."
