It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how these terms enrich the spiritual and cultural depth of the Biblical text. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the importance of maintaining fidelity to the original message while conveying the figurative meanings within a Christian worldview perspective. Great job!"
