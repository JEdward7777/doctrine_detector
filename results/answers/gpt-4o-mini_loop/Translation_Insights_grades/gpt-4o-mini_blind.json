  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the phrase \"image of God\" and its significance when applied to humans and Jesus. The suggested translations are well thought out and supported with theological reasoning. The answer effectively discusses the implications of these translations on human dignity, Christology, ethics, and responsibility. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated, but could benefit from a more explicit connection to the specific biblical passages that mention the \"image of God\" and how those passages inform the translations and their significance."
