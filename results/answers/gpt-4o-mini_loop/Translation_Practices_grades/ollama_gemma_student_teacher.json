  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the historical and theological reasons behind the use of \"LORD\" in place of \"Yahweh\" in Bible translations. They provide a well-articulated explanation of the significance of the Tetragrammaton in Jewish tradition, the importance of respecting God's name, and the contextual clarity achieved by using different names of God in the Hebrew Bible. The inclusion of contemporary translations incorporating \"Yahweh\" in footnotes adds depth to the analysis."
