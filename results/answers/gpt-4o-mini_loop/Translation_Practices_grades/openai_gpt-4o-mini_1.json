The answer displays a deep understanding of the historical and cultural reasons behind this translation convention within a Christian specific worldview. The inclusion of multiple reasons and the acknowledgment of contemporary efforts to include \"Yahweh\" in footnotes for deeper understanding further enhance the response."
