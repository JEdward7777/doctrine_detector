  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response that offers alternative translations for \"to be zealous\" reflecting its biblical meaning effectively. The examples given, such as \"to be passionate,\" \"to be fervent,\" and \"to strive diligently,\" align with Christian principles of fervor, dedication, and active faith. The student also connected these translations back to biblical passages, showing a good understanding of the importance of commitment in the Christian faith. Great job overall, but some improvements could be made by incorporating some of the teacher's suggestions to enhance the depth of the response further."
