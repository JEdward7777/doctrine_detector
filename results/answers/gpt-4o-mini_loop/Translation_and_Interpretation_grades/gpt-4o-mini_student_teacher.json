  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 90.\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the different nuances in the translation of \"Lord\" when referring to God versus ordinary people. They correctly explain the significance of the term in both contexts and provide relevant examples from scripture to support their points. Additionally, the student emphasizes the importance of recognizing these distinctions for proper interpretation of biblical passages and personal spiritual growth. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly referencing the teacher's answer to align more closely with the provided concern about proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms. Nonetheless, the response is well-written, insightful, and demonstrates a thorough grasp of the topic."
