  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"Lord\" in biblical translation, distinguishing between its usage when referring to God and ordinary people with clarity and depth. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impact the understanding of scripture and the nature of God. The integration of biblical references and the summary at the end further strengthen the response. Great job!"
