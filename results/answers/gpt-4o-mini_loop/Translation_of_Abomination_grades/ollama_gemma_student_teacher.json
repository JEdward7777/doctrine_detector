  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the term \"abomination\" in a biblical context. They effectively articulate its theological significance and provide nuanced translation strategies. The inclusion of contextualization, emotional weight, and eternal implications enhances the depth of the analysis. While the reference answer provides some useful suggestions, it lacks the theological elaboration and context-specific understanding demonstrated by the student's response."
