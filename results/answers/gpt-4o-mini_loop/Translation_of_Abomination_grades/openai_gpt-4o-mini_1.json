The suggestions for retaining the emotional and theological weight of the term, contextualizing it within biblical themes, and highlighting the eternal implications of abominable actions align well with a Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding accurate translation for understanding biblical texts and the severity of actions against God's laws."
