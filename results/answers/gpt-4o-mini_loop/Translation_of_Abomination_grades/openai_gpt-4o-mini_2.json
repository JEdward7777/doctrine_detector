It addresses the concern regarding accurate translation by offering strategies that not only capture the meaning of the term but also convey the severity of actions against God's laws. The inclusion of theological reflections, cultural context, and eternal implications demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of translating biblical concepts with precision and clarity."
