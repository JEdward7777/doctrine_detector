They have correctly identified the Greek word \"\u1f00\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\" and offered insightful translations that convey the nuances of affirmation, certainty, and truthfulness present in Jesus' statements. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological implications of Jesus' affirmations and the importance of conveying his message with clarity in different translations. Great work overall!"
