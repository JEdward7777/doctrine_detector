  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a thorough explanation of the phrase \"truly I tell you\" in the context of biblical translation, including potential translations and their connotations. It also highlights the importance of accurate translation and interpretation in conveying the message of Jesus' teachings. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of precise biblical translation and its implications for believers.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the initial response does not directly address the concern about understanding the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. While the response indirectly touches on this topic, it would be strengthened by more explicit discussion of the issue at hand."
