The understanding of the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation is demonstrated well throughout the response. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly tie the translations to the original Greek word \"\u1f00\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\" (am\u0113n) in a more explicit manner."
