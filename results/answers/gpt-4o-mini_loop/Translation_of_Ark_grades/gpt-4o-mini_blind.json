  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear explanation of the term \"ark\" in different Biblical contexts, focusing on the Ark of Noah and the Ark of the Covenant. The student demonstrates an understanding of the significance of these arks and their theological implications. The response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the symbolism and theological significance of each ark, particularly in relation to themes such as salvation, covenant, and presence of God. Additionally, integrating more Scripture references and theological analysis would further strengthen the answer. Overall, a solid explanation with room for further depth and expansion."
