The term "ark" in the Bible can refer to different objects depending on the context, and its translation varies accordingly. The most notable instances of "ark" in the Bible are:

1. **The Ark of Noah** (Genesis 6–9): This ark is a large vessel built by Noah to save his family and pairs of animals from the Flood. The Hebrew word used here is "תֵּבַת" (tevah), which specifically refers to a box or chest. This emphasizes its function as a means of salvation, reflecting God's mercy and preservation during a time of judgment.

2. **The Ark of the Covenant** (Exodus 25–40): This ark is a sacred container made of acacia wood, overlaid with gold, and it held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, along with other sacred items. The Hebrew term for this ark is "אָרֹן" (aron), which translates to "chest" or "box." This ark was central to Israelite worship and represented God's presence among His people. It served as a powerful symbol of His covenant relationship with Israel, highlighting His holiness and their need for reverence.

3. **Other References**: While the term "ark" may appear in different contexts, instances outside Noah and the Covenant are less common. For example, in Isaiah 54:2, it might be understood as a protective enclosure, symbolizing God's provision and care.

In translations, "ark" is typically used consistently for both the Ark of Noah and the Ark of the Covenant. However, understanding each context reveals its unique significance. Various translations (e.g., NIV, ESV, KJV) may retain the term "ark" or further clarify its purpose and significance through footnotes or study guides.

In summary, while "ark" is preserved in translations, its implications, meaning, and significance differ depending on the specific biblical context. Recognizing these differences is essential for grasping the deeper theological messages conveyed in Scripture, reminding believers of God's faithfulness, presence, and the importance of obedience to His word.
