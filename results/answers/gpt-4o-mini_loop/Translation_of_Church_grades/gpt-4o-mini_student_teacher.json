  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer with various translations that reflect the deeper meaning of the term 'church'. However, while the translations offered capture different aspects of the church's nature, some of them focus more on specific aspects like unity, fellowship, or relationship with Christ, rather than solely emphasizing the inclusivity of all believers. The concern was to ensure accurate representation of the church's inclusive nature in translations, and some of the terms mentioned may not fully address this aspect. The student could have included more translations that specifically highlight the inclusivity of all believers in the church to align better with the provided reference answer."
