The inclusion of specific translations in different languages and the explanation of how they convey the concept of holiness and God's divine nature is well done. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of maintaining the deep respect and reverence inherent in the concept of holiness across languages. Overall, it is a comprehensive and insightful analysis with a strong focus on theological accuracy."
