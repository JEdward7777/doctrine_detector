The term "predestined" is commonly used in Christian theological contexts, particularly in discussions around concepts like salvation and Divine sovereignty. Here are some suggested translations and interpretations, along with key verses where the term is used:

1. **New International Version (NIV)** - "Predestined" is used in Romans 8:29, which states, "For those God foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son." This reflects the idea of God's predetermined plan for individuals to share in the glory of Christ.

2. **English Standard Version (ESV)** - The ESV also uses "predestined," particularly in Ephesians 1:5: "In love he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will." This verse underscores God's sovereign choice in the salvation and adoption of believers.

3. **New American Standard Bible (NASB)** - This translation includes "predestined" in Ephesians 1:11, emphasizing the theological nuances of God's foreknowledge and divine plan: "In him also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to his purpose."

4. **King James Version (KJV)** - The KJV uses "predestinated" in Romans 8:29 and Ephesians 1:5, reflecting historical theological usage and conveying the same meaning of divine foreordination.

5. **The Message (MSG)** - This paraphrase may use more contemporary language, such as "arranged in advance", to express the same central idea found in traditional translations, making it more accessible to modern readers.

6. **New Revised Standard Version (NRSV)** - The NRSV includes "predestined" and emphasizes the divine action and purpose in passages like Ephesians 1:5, highlighting the notion of God's providential care and plan for believers.

In theological discussions, "predestined" encompasses ideas of God's foreknowledge, election, and assurance of salvation. In Calvinistic theology, it is often interpreted as unconditional election, where God chooses some individuals for salvation apart from any foreseen merit. Conversely, Arminian perspectives emphasize free will and God's foreknowledge, suggesting that God's predestination is based on His knowledge of who will choose to accept Him.

Choosing an appropriate translation will depend on the theological context and the audience's understanding of these significant concepts, providing a rich basis for discussion on the doctrines of election and salvation within the Christian faith.
