  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80 out of 100.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive overview of the term \"predestined\" in various translations within Christian theological contexts, discussing key verses and theological implications effectively. The student also highlighted theological differences in interpretations, providing a well-rounded understanding. However, there was a deviation from the teacher's reference answer in providing alternative translations, which are more focused on synonyms rather than exploring deeper meanings. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid grasp of the topic with thorough research and explanations."
