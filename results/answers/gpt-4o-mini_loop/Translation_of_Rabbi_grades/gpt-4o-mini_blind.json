  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of important considerations when translating the term 'Rabbi' into various languages. The student effectively addresses cultural context, religious implications, phonetic considerations, existing terminology, audience understanding, ecumenical sensitivity, scriptural context, and theological accuracy. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the complexities involved in translation and the need to convey both the original meaning and context of the term. The only improvement could be to provide more specific examples of how these considerations might play out in actual translations in different languages. Overall, a strong and well-thought-out answer."
