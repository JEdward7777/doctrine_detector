  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response addressing various important considerations when translating the term 'Rabbi' into various languages. They have shown a good understanding of the cultural, religious, linguistic, and theological aspects that need to be taken into account. The answer is well-structured and demonstrates a deep level of analysis and consideration. The only area where there could be slight improvement is in directly addressing the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. Nonetheless, the student has done an excellent job overall."
