  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of translating the term 'Rabbi' while considering the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The considerations outlined address the importance of maintaining the significance of the title without diminishing Jesus' divinity or unique role in Christianity. The response appropriately emphasizes the need to convey the spiritual and authoritative aspects of Jesus' teaching role in translations. However, it could further strengthen the theological implications by explicitly mentioning the divinity of Jesus and how this should be reflected in the translation to preserve Christian doctrine."
