  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the considerations involved in translating the term 'Rabbi' while ensuring an accurate representation of Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith. It addresses the concern directly by emphasizing the need to respect the significance of the title 'Rabbi' without undermining Jesus' divine nature, while also highlighting the importance of conforming to cultural norms in translating the term. The only room for improvement could be in explicitly tying the theological accuracy of the translation to the Christian worldview, to further emphasize the importance of aligning with Christian beliefs. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on translating religious titles."
