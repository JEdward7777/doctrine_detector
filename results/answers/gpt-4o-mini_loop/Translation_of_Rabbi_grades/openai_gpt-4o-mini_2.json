The focus on accurately representing Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith is evident throughout the response. The considerations outlined align well with Christian worldview principles and demonstrate sensitivity to the theological implications of the translation. Additionally, the emphasis on maintaining the title's significance while avoiding implications that Jesus was merely a schoolteacher is in line with upholding a high standard of theological accuracy. The attention to ecumenical sensitivity and scriptural context further enhances the overall quality of the response."
