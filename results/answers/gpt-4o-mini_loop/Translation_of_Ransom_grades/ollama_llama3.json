  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of \"ransom\" in a biblical context, highlighting its theological significance and emphasizing the importance of accurate translation. The provided options for each language show a clear grasp of the nuances of liberation and sacrifice, and the explanations are thorough and well-supported.\n\nHowever, I deduct 15 points because this response does not directly address the concern about ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. While the response does acknowledge the importance of considering cultural context, it could more explicitly discuss strategies for avoiding misunderstandings or miscommunications that might arise from using different words in different languages.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively explores the concept of \"ransom\" and its translation into various languages, but could benefit from more explicit attention to the concern about theological terms."
