The suggestions for translations in different languages align well with the concern of accurately conveying theological terms across linguistic and cultural contexts. The inclusion of explanations and footnotes as a means to deepen understanding further demonstrates a commitment to fidelity to biblical principles. Great attention to detail and consideration of theological significance is evident throughout the response."
