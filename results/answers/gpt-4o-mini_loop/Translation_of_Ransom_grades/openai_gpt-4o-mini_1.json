The suggested translations not only capture the core meanings of liberation and sacrifice but also consider the broader theological implications of Christ's sacrifice for humanity. The focus on maintaining fidelity to biblical principles while ensuring cultural resonance and understanding across linguistic contexts is commendable. The response effectively addresses the concern of accurately conveying theological terms in translation, reflecting a deep understanding of the Christian worldview."
