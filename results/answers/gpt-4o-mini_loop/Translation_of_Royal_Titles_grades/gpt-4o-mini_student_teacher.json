  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and culturally sensitive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, showcasing a strong understanding of linguistic nuances. Additionally, the student effectively connected the concept of honoring authority figures to biblical teachings, specifically referencing Romans 13:1. However, the student missed aligning the translation with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which suggests using 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' indicating a slight deviation from the focus on natural, target-language appropriate translations."
