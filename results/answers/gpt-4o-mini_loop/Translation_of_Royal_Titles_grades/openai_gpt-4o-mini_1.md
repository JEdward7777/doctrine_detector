## [Answer](../Translation_of_Royal_Titles.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The phrase "Your Majesty" is a formal way of addressing a sovereign or royal figure, and its translation can vary significantly across languages. Here are a few examples of how "Your Majesty" can be translated:

1. **Spanish**: "Su Majestad"
2. **French**: "Votre Majesté"
3. **German**: "Ihre Majestät"
4. **Italian**: "Vostra Maestà"
5. **Portuguese**: "Sua Majestade"
6. **Russian**: "Ваше Величество" (Vashe Velichestvo)
7. **Chinese (Simplified)**: "阁下" (Géxià) or "陛下" (Bìxià)
8. **Japanese**: "陛下" (Heika)
9. **Arabic**: "جلالتك" (Jalalatik)
10. **Hebrew**: "אדוני המלך" (Adoni HaMelech - "My Lord the King")

Each translation retains the respect and honor inherent in the original English phrase. From a Christian perspective, the act of honoring authority figures aligns with biblical teachings, such as Romans 13:1 which states, "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established." This emphasizes the importance of recognizing and respecting those in positions of authority, reflecting the dignity that comes with their roles. When addressing royalty, context, formality, and the specific cultural practices of address all play a crucial role in the appropriate choice of words, ultimately underscoring a commitment to honor and respect ordained by God.
