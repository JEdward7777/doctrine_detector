  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. \n\nThe student provided a comprehensive response that considers various important factors when translating the term \"sanctuary\" in modern texts, including contextual meaning, cultural sensitivity, theological implications, historical usage, consistency with Scripture, linguistic nuances, clarifying concepts, and doctrinal accuracy. The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the complexity involved in translating Biblical terms and provided thoughtful insights on each consideration.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could be improved by placing greater emphasis on ensuring that the translation accurately reflects the Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place, as mentioned in the reference answer. This central concern should have been highlighted more prominently throughout the response to align more closely with the specified concern of maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms. \n\nOverall, the student's answer is well-reasoned and insightful, but could benefit from a clearer focus on maintaining the original Biblical definition of \"sanctuary.\""
