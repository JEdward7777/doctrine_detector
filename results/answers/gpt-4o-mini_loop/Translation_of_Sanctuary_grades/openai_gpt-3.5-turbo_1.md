1. **Contextual Meaning**: The term "sanctuary" may carry varied meanings based on the context. In biblical texts, it often references a sacred space where Godâ€™s presence is felt, such as in the Tabernacle or the Temple. A thorough understanding of the specific context is vital to provide an accurate and relevant translation that reflects its intended connotation.
