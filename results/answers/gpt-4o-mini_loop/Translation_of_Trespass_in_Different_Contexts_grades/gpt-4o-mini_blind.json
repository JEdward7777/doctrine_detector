The student effectively highlights the theological significance of viewing interpersonal wrongs as \"sins\" and the importance of grace, repentance, and reconciliation in such situations. The integration of biblical references and the emphasis on accountability, relationships, and community restoration are commendable. However, the response could be further strengthened by expanding on the concept of biblical repentance and perhaps addressing how a balanced approach incorporating both grace and accountability is crucial in dealing with inter-personal violations in a church community."
