  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively explores the theological, relational, and practical implications of translating \"trespass\" as \"sin\" versus \"breaking the rule\" in a church community context, demonstrating a deep understanding of the Christian worldview. The connection to scriptural integrity and community values is clearly articulated, and the focus on relational fidelity and grace aligns well with Christian teachings on forgiveness and restoration. The response could be strengthened by providing more direct references to specific biblical passages or theological principles to further support the arguments made."
