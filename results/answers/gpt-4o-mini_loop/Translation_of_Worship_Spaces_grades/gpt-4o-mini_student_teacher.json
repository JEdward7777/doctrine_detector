  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and thoughtful answer addressing both the literal and theological aspects of translating \"house of Yahweh.\" They have effectively emphasized the importance of preserving the personal name of God and considering the context to convey the significance of worship spaces. The suggested translations and explanations demonstrate a solid understanding of the concerns raised in the question. However, the reference answer may have provided a more direct and concise translation option, which could have further improved the student's response."
