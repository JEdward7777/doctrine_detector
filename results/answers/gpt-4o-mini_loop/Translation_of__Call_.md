In a biblical context, the phrase "You must call his name" is a significant directive found in passages like Matthew 1:21, where an angel instructs Joseph regarding the naming of Jesus. Here are some alternative translations along with specific biblical references and explanations for each:

1. **"You shall name him..."** - This phrasing emphasizes a divine command, aligning with the directive given to Joseph. It highlights the authority behind the instruction, reflecting the significance of naming in biblical tradition.

2. **"You are to give him the name..."** - This translation indicates an action that is both purposeful and deliberate, underscoring the importance of the name Jesus, which means "The Lord saves" (Matthew 1:21).

3. **"His name shall be called..."** - This version reflects the prophetic nature of the naming, as seen in Isaiah 9:6, where the Messiah is referred to by various names that encapsulate His character and mission, such as Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God.

4. **"You will call him..."** - This phrasing presents the naming as a future event, grounding it in the narrative of Joseph’s decision to follow the angel’s command (Matthew 1:24-25).

5. **"You are to call his name..."** - This conveys a direct command, reinforcing the clarity and urgency of the instruction. It can be associated with how God instructs His people throughout Scripture regarding significant tasks.

6. **"Name him..."** - A succinct command that still captures the essence of divine instruction, reflecting the expectation that Joseph will obediently follow the directive given to him.

Different translations provide nuanced perspectives on this significant command. Each rendering emphasizes the divine authority and importance of the name Jesus within the narrative and the broader theological implications of His identity as Savior.
