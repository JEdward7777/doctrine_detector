  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90. \n\nThe student did an excellent job of providing alternative translations of the phrase \"You must call his name\" in a biblical context and supported each translation with specific biblical references and explanations. The student showed a deep understanding of the nuances of biblical language and how different translations can impact interpretation. The only small critique is that the student did not include the specific translation \"you must name him\" provided in the reference answer from the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a thorough engagement with the question and provided insightful analysis, earning a high grade."
