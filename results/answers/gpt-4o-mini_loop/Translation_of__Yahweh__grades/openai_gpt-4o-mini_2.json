The response effectively addresses concerns about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices by highlighting the significance of maintaining traditional translation practices while also making the text accessible to congregations. The only slight deduction is that the response could have further emphasized the importance of preserving the sacredness and reverence of God's name within the context of cultural sensitivity and translation philosophy."
