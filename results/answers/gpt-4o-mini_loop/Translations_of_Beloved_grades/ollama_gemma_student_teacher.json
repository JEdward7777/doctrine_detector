  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of \"beloved\" within a Christian worldview. They provide insightful translation suggestions that align with biblical contexts and theological concepts. The inclusion of examples from various passages enhances the clarity and applicability of their suggestions. The response also emphasizes the importance of considering the specific context when translating the term, demonstrating a nuanced and thoughtful approach. While the reference answer provides some valid suggestions, it lacks the depth and breadth of the student's response."
