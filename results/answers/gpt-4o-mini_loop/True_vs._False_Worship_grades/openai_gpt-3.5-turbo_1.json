It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding true worship to ensure Christians honor and serve God alone. The references to Scripture and the inclusion of various aspects such as the nature of the divine, source of authority, transformation of life, purpose and meaning, and community add depth and clarity to the explanation. Overall, an excellent analysis with a strong Christian worldview perspective."
