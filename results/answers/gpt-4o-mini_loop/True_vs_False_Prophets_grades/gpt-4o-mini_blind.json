  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90/100\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and well-structured explanation based on biblical teachings regarding how to distinguish between a true prophet of God and a false prophet. It accurately emphasizes the importance of aligning with Scripture, displaying proper character and fruit, glorifying God, fulfilling prophecy, confirmation by the community, motivations, revelation, and insight. One minor improvement could be to further emphasize the need for discernment in testing the spirits based on 1 John 4:1-3. Overall, it is a solid and doctrinally correct response."
