## [Answer](../True_vs_False_Prophets.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
Distinguishing between a true prophet of God and a false prophet is an important aspect of Christian discernment. Here are some key criteria based on biblical teachings:

1. **Consistency with Scripture**: A true prophet will always align with the teachings of the Bible. Deuteronomy 18:21-22 instructs that if a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord and their prophecy does not come to pass, that prophet is not sent by God. Additionally, their teachings should adhere to the foundational truths of scripture (Isaiah 8:20).

2. **Character and Fruit**: Jesus teaches that you will know them by their fruits (Matthew 7:16-20). A true prophet will demonstrate the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23) in their life, such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Their character should reflect the nature of Christ.

3. **Glorification of God, Not Self**: True prophets will point to God and not themselves. Their messages should glorify God and lead others toward Him, promoting His agenda rather than their own desires (John 16:13-14).

4. **Fulfillment of Prophecy**: True prophecies will come to pass. The accuracy of their predictions serves as a significant indicator of their divine commission (Jeremiah 28:9).

5. **Confirmation by the Community**: The recognition of a true prophet often comes through affirmation from a community of believers (1 Corinthians 14:29). This includes discernment and validation by church leaders and the broader body of Christ.

6. **Motivation and Message**: True prophets may endure suffering and persecution for delivering their messages, rather than seeking personal gain or recognition (2 Timothy 3:12). Their messages should call for repentance and align with God’s will for His people.

7. **Revelation and Insight**: A true prophet receives divine revelation and possesses insights that align with God’s purposes, especially regarding spiritual matters and the state of the heart (Ephesians 4:11-13).

In summary, discernment is crucial for believers. It is encouraged to pray for wisdom and guidance from the Holy Spirit while remaining rooted in Scripture to effectively evaluate the messages and the lives of those who claim to be prophets.
