  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation highlighting the differences between hope in God and wishing, incorporating key Christian principles such as faith, assurance, action, endurance, and eternal perspective. While the response effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic, it may have gone slightly beyond the scope of the given reference answer, resulting in a minor deviation from the specific focus on distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking. However, the student's insights were insightful and aligned well with a Christian worldview."
