  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thorough response that effectively identifies various actions and practices condemned as abominations in the Bible. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept and provides relevant scriptural references to support their claims. The inclusion of a broader principle connecting actions to injustice, unfaithfulness, and deviations from God\u2019s commands adds depth to the analysis."
