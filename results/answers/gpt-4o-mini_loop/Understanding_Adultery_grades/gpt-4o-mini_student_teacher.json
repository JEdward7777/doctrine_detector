  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that covers various aspects of adultery as addressed in the Bible, including moral, relational, and spiritual consequences. They referenced key passages and teachings effectively. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern raised about the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality more explicitly throughout the response."
