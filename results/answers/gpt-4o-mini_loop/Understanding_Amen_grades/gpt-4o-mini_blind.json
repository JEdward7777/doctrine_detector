The inclusion of references to both the Old and New Testaments, as well as the theological implications and communal aspect of saying 'amen', demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept. The response aligns with Christian doctrinal correctness and effectively conveys the deeper spiritual meaning behind the use of 'amen' in prayer. Well done!"
