  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, incorporating relevant biblical references and theological implications. The student effectively articulates the idea of God's sovereign will in salvation and the balance between human free will and divine sovereignty. The response could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the role of faith in responding to God's grace, as well as a deeper exploration of the implications of this doctrine on Christian living. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound explanation."
