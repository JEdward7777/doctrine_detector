  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response effectively captures the essence of being \"appointed to eternal life\" by highlighting God's sovereign will and grace in choosing individuals for salvation. It also connects this concept to passages like Acts 13:48, which provides scriptural support for this understanding. The response further explores the implications of this doctrine, emphasizing God's initiative in salvation and encouraging a sense of reliance on His sovereignty.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the balance between human free will and divine sovereignty, as mentioned in the concern. While it touches on this topic briefly, a more nuanced discussion would strengthen the overall response. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept and its significance in Christian theology.\n\nComment: A well-written and thoughtful response that effectively communicates the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life.\" To take it to the next level, consider exploring the tension between divine sovereignty and human free will in more detail."
