The student effectively articulates key doctrinal aspects such as fulfillment of the sacrificial system, substitutionary atonement, restoration of relationship, demonstration of God's love and justice, foundation for salvation, and transformation into new life. The references to relevant scripture further enhance the depth and credibility of the answer. Well done!"
