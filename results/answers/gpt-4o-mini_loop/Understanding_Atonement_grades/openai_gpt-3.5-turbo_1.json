The answer effectively demonstrates an understanding of the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology within a holistic framework. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses further strengthens the theological argument presented in the response. Great job in articulating the profound significance of Jesus' death in Christian belief."
