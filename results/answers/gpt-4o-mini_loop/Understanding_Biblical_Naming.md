## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, the phrase "his name is called John" appears primarily in the context of the birth of John the Baptist, particularly in Luke 1:63. This moment occurs when Zechariah, John's father, is asked what the child's name will be. The phrase communicates not just a simple act of naming, but an event rich with cultural and theological significance.

Names in the biblical narrative carry deep meaning and reflect God's will, character, or the destiny of the individual. The name "John" means "Yahweh is gracious" or "the Lord is gracious," indicating the grace of God demonstrated through the miraculous circumstances surrounding John's birth, especially considering that both of his parents were elderly. This not only signifies John's own special role in God's plan but also highlights the theme of divine grace permeating the story of salvation.

Beyond John, the meaning of names is pivotal throughout Scripture. For example, Jesus is named ‘Jesus’ (which means “the Lord saves”), encapsulating His mission of bringing salvation to humanity. Similarly, other figures in the Bible experience significant name changes that reflect their transformation and purpose in God's plan, such as Abram becoming Abraham, meaning "father of many nations," or Saul becoming Paul, indicating a new identity in Christ.

The act of naming thus functions not merely as an identification but as a declaration of purpose and identity, emphasizing the overarching narrative of God’s grace and the fulfillment of His promises. The naming of John, in particular, serves to underscore the prophetic significance of his life and ministry as the forerunner of Christ, showing how God’s gracious plan unfolds through history.
