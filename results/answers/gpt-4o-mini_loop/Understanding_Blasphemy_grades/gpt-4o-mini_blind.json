  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the biblical implications of speaking against God or others and effectively defines blasphemy within the Scriptures. The scriptural references and theological explanations are well-articulated and align with a Christian worldview. The emphasis on repentance, accountability, and building a culture of respect shows a solid understanding of the topic. Great job overall."
