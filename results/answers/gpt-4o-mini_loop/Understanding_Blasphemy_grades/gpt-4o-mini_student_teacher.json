  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-organized response discussing the biblical implications of speaking against God or others and defining blasphemy within the Scriptures. They referenced relevant biblical passages and theological implications, showing a strong understanding of the topic. However, the student could have incorporated more direct integration of the teacher's specific definition of blasphemy to align closer to the given answer. It's crucial for students to ensure that their responses directly address the concerns presented in the question, which was slightly missed in this case."
