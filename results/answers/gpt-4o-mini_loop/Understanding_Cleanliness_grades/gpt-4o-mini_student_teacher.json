  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the Biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean' in relation to moral purity. They effectively connect Old Testament ceremonial cleanliness with moral implications, highlight the New Testament perspective on purity, discuss the concept of holiness, and emphasize the communal and individual responsibilities in pursuing moral purity. The answer is well-supported by relevant biblical references and insights. The only minor critique would be to explicitly address the concern of guiding believers in personal and communal lives that was mentioned in the prompt."
