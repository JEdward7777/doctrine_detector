  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the biblical definitions of clean and unclean, emphasizing their significance in both physical and spiritual realms. It effectively connects these concepts to moral purity and emphasizes the importance of internal transformation and ethical living. The inclusion of Old and New Testament perspectives, as well as the call to holiness and community responsibility, demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian worldview. The only slight deduction is for not directly addressing the concern in the initial response, but overall, the content is thorough and insightful."
