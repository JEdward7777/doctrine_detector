  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid analysis of 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16, highlighting the theological insights related to condemnation and God's grace. The response effectively explains the internal struggles and external consequences of condemnation as portrayed in these verses. The emphasis on God's mercy, forgiveness, and the redemptive work of Christ is appropriate. However, there could be a deeper exploration of the doctrinal implications of justification and sanctification in relation to condemnation, which would enhance the theological richness of the response. Overall, a good understanding is demonstrated, but there is room for further theological depth and analysis."
