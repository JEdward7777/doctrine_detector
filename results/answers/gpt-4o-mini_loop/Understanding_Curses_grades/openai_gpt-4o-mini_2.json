The integration of specific scriptural references and the clear explanation of the spiritual, relational, and accountability aspects of cursing demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic. The response effectively addresses the concern raised, making a strong case for the negative consequences of cursing and the call to use our words to reflect God's character."
