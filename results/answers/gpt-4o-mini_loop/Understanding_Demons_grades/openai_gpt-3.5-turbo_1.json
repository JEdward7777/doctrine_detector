It effectively addresses the concern by delving into various biblical passages and emphasizing the significance of Jesus' authority in casting out unclean spirits. The connection between spiritual warfare, repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, and the victory of God's kingdom over evil is well-established, making this a comprehensive and well-articulated response."
