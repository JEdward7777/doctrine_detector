However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer as it includes additional elements such as active participation in building community, engaging in practices like prayer, and spreading the love of Christ, which while valuable, could be more explicitly linked to the core definition and responsibilities of being a disciple as mentioned in the reference answer."
