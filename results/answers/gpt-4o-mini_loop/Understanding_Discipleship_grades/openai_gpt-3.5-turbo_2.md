Discipleship entails a personal relationship with Jesus, characterized by faith, obedience, and a desire to grow spiritually. 

This commitment is not merely individual; it also includes active participation in building community with other believers. Engaging in practices such as prayer, studying Scripture, serving others, and participating in the fellowship of the church strengthens this relationship and enhances spiritual growth.

Disciples are called to share the love of Christ with others, proclaiming the good news of salvation and demonstrating God's grace through their actions. Ultimately, discipleship is about transformation and aligning oneâ€™s life purpose with the mission of Jesus, which includes spreading His love and message to every corner of the world.
