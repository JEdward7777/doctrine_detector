## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Bible speaks extensively about God's judgment, emphasizing its righteousness, thoroughness, and eternal implications. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Nature of God's Judgment**: 
   - **Righteousness**: God's judgment is inherently just. Psalm 89:14 states, "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne," indicating that His judgments are grounded in perfect moral principles.
   - **Omniscience**: Unlike human judgment, which can be limited and flawed, God's understanding encompasses all aspects of existence. Hebrews 4:13 affirms, "Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight; everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account."

2. **Scope**: 
   - God's judgment considers the heart and motives behind actions. While humans can only observe external behavior, God perceives the intentions behind those actions. This profound truth is highlighted in 1 Samuel 16:7: "For the LORD sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the LORD looks on the heart."

3. **Eternal Judgment**: 
   - The scripture speaks of a final judgment where all individuals will stand before God to account for their lives. Revelation 20:12 describes this solemn event, presenting that the dead are judged according to what they have done. The eternal aspect of God's judgment contrasts with human judgment, which often only affects our earthly lives.

4. **Human Judgment**:
   - Human judgment can be biased and subjective, influenced by personal feelings or external circumstances, leading to unfair treatment or misinterpretation of a person's actions. Jesus cautions against such judgment in Matthew 7:1-2, stating that the measure we use will be used against us.
   - Additionally, human judgment is limited by context and understanding, leading to potential errors. In stark contrast, God's judgment is impartial and founded on absolute truth.

5. **Grace and Mercy**: 
   - Importantly, God's judgment is intertwined with His grace and mercy. While He is a righteous judge, He is also compassionate and desires repentance and reconciliation. This is illustrated in 2 Peter 3:9, where it is stated that God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

In summary, God's judgment is characterized by righteousness, omniscience, and eternal significance, distinctly setting it apart from human judgment, which can be flawed, biased, and limited in scope. The Bible invites believers to trust in God's ultimate justice while being mindful of their tendencies to judge others superficially.
