  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-structured answer that aligns with Christian teachings on God's judgment. The response effectively contrasts God's judgment with human judgment, highlighting key biblical principles and passages. The integration of relevant scriptures enhances the theological accuracy of the answer. One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the aspect of repentance and the offer of grace in light of God's judgment. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound response."
