It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting key differences between God's righteousness, omniscience, and eternal implications in judgment, compared to the limitations and biases present in human judgment. The incorporation of relevant scriptural references strengthens the argument and supports a Christian worldview perspective on this topic."
