The integration of scriptural verses and explanations effectively supports the argument, showcasing a strong grasp of Christian worldview perspectives on judgment. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie in the concept of sin as a central aspect influencing both God's judgment and the need for repentance in human judgment practices."
