## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Bible presents the concept of eternal life as a precious gift from God, received through faith in Jesus Christ. Here are several key points related to inheriting eternal life according to Scripture:

1. **Faith in Jesus Christ**: The New Testament underscores that eternal life is accessible through belief in Jesus. For instance, John 3:16 proclaims, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

2. **Grace, Not Works**: Ephesians 2:8-9 clarifies that eternal life is a product of God’s grace, not a result of human effort: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."

3. **Repentance**: The act of repentance is vital in the process of salvation. Acts 2:38 highlights this, stating, "Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'" Thus, turning away from sin is integral to embracing God’s gift of eternal life.

4. **Following Christ**: Jesus emphasizes the necessity of being His follower. He says in John 10:27-28, "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand."

5. **The Role of the Holy Spirit**: The Holy Spirit is crucial in the lives of believers and in securing eternal life. Romans 8:16 assures us, "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children."

6. **Perseverance**: Scripture teaches that true believers will endure in their faith. Jesus states in Matthew 24:13, "But the one who stands firm to the end will be saved."

7. **Inheritance of Eternal Life**: The promise of inheriting the kingdom of God, which encompasses eternal life, is also discussed in Scripture. In Matthew 25:34, the King (representing Jesus) invites the righteous, saying, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world."

In summary, inheriting eternal life, according to the Bible, involves faith in Jesus Christ, accepting God's grace, repenting from sin, and faithfully following Him throughout life. The gift of eternal life is experienced now by believers and holds the promise of complete fulfillment in eternity.
