  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer about inheriting eternal life according to the Bible. The response is grounded in key scriptures and essential Christian doctrines, such as salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, the importance of repentance, following Christ, the role of the Holy Spirit, perseverance in faith, and the promise of inheriting the kingdom of God. The student effectively weaves these elements together to present a cohesive explanation. Great job!"
