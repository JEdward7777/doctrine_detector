  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of how eternal life is attained according to Scripture, emphasizing faith in Jesus Christ, God's grace, repentance, following Christ, the role of the Holy Spirit, perseverance, and the inheritance of eternal life. However, the initial given answer is contradictory to the Christian worldview, as eternal life is not earned by obeying God's laws but is a gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ. Therefore, the response contradicts the core Christian belief regarding salvation, hence the lower grade."
