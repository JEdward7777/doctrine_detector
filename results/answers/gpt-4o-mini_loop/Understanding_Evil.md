## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Bible presents a nuanced distinction between 'evil' and 'wickedness,' both of which are important concepts that reflect moral character and behavior in relation to God's standards.

1. **Evil**: In Scripture, 'evil' conveys a broader moral quality that opposes God's nature and righteousness. It encompasses various forms of immorality, sin, and harm inflicted upon others and oneself. The Hebrew term "ra" (רַע) and the Greek "kakos" (κακός) highlight this general sense of wrongdoing and malevolence. For instance, in Genesis 6:5, it states that the wickedness of humanity was “great in the earth,” and that “every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” Here, 'evil' reflects a pervasive condition that contradicts divine goodness.

2. **Wickedness**: In contrast, 'wickedness' (from the Hebrew "rasha" [רָשָׁע] and the Greek "poneria" [πονηρία]) suggests a more active, intentional engagement in wrongdoing. It often indicates a conscious choice to commit acts of injustice or harm. Proverbs 4:14-15 provides wisdom on this, advising against entering the path of the wicked and portraying wicked behavior as the pursuit of evil. Such passages indicate that wickedness involves an awareness and volition to act against God’s commandments.

In conclusion, while both terms point to moral failing, 'evil' refers to a broader condition of being against God's good, whereas 'wickedness' signifies a deliberate choice to engage in immoral acts. The Scriptures consistently call believers to reject both, underlining the imperative of pursuing righteousness and aligning with God's will in all aspects of life.
