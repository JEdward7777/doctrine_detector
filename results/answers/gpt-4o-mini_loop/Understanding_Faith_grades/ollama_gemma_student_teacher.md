Having faith in Jesus means to trust in Him as the Son of God, believing in His teachings and accepting His sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, as reflected in John 3:16 and Romans 5:8. It involves developing a personal relationship with Jesus, recognizing Him as both Savior and Lord (Romans 10:9). 

This faith is marked by reliance on His grace for salvation (Ephesians 2:8-9) and believing in His resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:17). It is a commitment to follow His example in daily life (Matthew 16:24) and live according to His teachings, as emphasized in John 14:15. 

Moreover, faith in Jesus is not merely an intellectual agreement; it is a deep, transformative trust that changes oneâ€™s actions, attitudes, and priorities in alignment with Christian beliefs and the community of believers (Galatians 2:20).  This transformative aspect is captured in 2 Corinthians 5:17, which speaks to becoming a new creation in Christ.
