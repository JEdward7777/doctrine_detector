The term 'faithless' implies a lack of faith or trust in God. In a Christian theological context, it often refers to someone who does not believe in God, exhibits untrustworthiness in their relationship with Him, or has turned away from their commitment to faith. This term can also highlight a failure to uphold one's promises to God, reflecting a spiritual condition marked by doubt, disbelief, or disloyalty.
