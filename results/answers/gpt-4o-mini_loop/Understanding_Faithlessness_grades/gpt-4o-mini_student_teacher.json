  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of the term 'faithless' within a Christian theological context, emphasizing the implications of lacking faith or trust in God. They effectively link faithlessness to behaviors that reflect a disconnect from God's promises and reliability. However, there is room for improvement in connecting faithlessness specifically to moral conduct as highlighted in the concern. The student could strengthen their answer by explicitly addressing how faithlessness influences moral behavior."
