  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-structured answer that effectively outlines the differences between the concept of fear in the Bible and our common understanding of fear in daily life. The response accurately highlights key distinctions such as the types of fear, the transformative nature of biblical fear, the importance of courage in fear, the context of trust in God, and the purpose and motivation behind biblical fear. The explanation is clear and supported with relevant biblical references. However, to enhance the response further, the student could have included more specific examples from the Bible illustrating each point. Overall, a solid and insightful analysis."
