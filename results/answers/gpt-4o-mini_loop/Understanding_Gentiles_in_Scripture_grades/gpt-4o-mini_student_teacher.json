The answer effectively highlighted key events like Peter's vision, the Council of Jerusalem, and the teachings of Jesus and Paul that contributed to the shift from exclusion to inclusion. However, the answer could have been improved by more directly addressing the concern of how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles affected their relationships within the early church. Overall, a strong and thorough response with room for slight improvement."
