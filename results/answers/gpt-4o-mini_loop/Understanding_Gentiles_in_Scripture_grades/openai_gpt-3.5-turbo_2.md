## [Answer](../Understanding_Gentiles_in_Scripture.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Israelites' perception of Gentiles significantly shaped their relationships with them, especially during the early church period. In the Old Testament, Gentiles (non-Jews) were often viewed with suspicion or as outsiders. This was rooted in the strong identity and covenant belonging among the Israelites, who believed they were chosen by God as His special people. Laws and customs set them apart, leading many Israelites to hold strict views regarding purity, worship, and social interactions with Gentiles.

In the early church, which emerged after the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the descent of the Holy Spirit, these perceptions began to evolve. Initially, the apostles and disciples viewed the message of Jesus as one primarily for the Jews. This can be seen in their early preaching, where they focused on Jewish audiences (Acts 2). However, pivotal events, such as Peter's vision of the clean and unclean animals (Acts 10:9-16), led to a radical rethinking that the Gospel is for all people, breaking the barriers of the old covenant.

The Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15) further redefined relationships between Jewish believers and Gentiles. It addressed whether Gentile converts needed to adhere to Jewish laws, such as circumcision. The decision, guided by the Holy Spirit, that Gentiles need not follow the entire Mosaic Law, but should instead abstain from specific practices (Acts 15:19-20), marked a significant theological shift that fostered unity and inclusivity.

Jesus’ teaching also laid the groundwork for this transformation. He reached out to Gentiles during His ministry, as exemplified in His interactions with the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4) and the healing of the Roman centurion's servant (Matthew 8:5-13), revealing God’s love extends beyond ethnic boundaries.

The Apostle Paul became a vital figure in promoting this inclusive message. He emphasized in Galatians 3:28 that in Christ, there is no distinctions between Jew and Gentile, highlighting the unity found in faith. This theological shift brought significant transformations to the early church, characterized by both challenges and a commitment to embodying the inclusive nature of Christ's love.

As the early church continued to grow, it moved from a perspective of segregation to one of unity in Christ, laying the groundwork for the global expansion of the Christian faith beyond its Jewish roots. This ongoing transformation reflected the heart of the Gospel message—that all are welcome to partake in the Kingdom of God.
