The biblical references effectively support each point made. However, the concern regarding believers struggling to comprehend the implications of God's sovereignty in their personal lives is not directly addressed in the response. Adding a paragraph or discussion on how believers can overcome this struggle and apply the concept of God's sovereignty personally would further strengthen the answer."
