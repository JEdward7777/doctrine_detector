  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained analysis of the phrase \"God has called us by name,\" relating it to key theological concepts such as personal relationship, divine purpose, assurance, redemption, and response to God's call. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern regarding understanding the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals. The student effectively conveyed the significance of being called by name in reflecting God's intimate knowledge, redemptive work, belonging to Him, and the call to follow Him."
