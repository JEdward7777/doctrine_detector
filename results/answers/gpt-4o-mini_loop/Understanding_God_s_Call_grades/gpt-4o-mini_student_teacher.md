The phrase "God has called us by name" reflects several important theological concepts found in the Bible, particularly in passages such as Isaiah 43:1, where God reassures His people, saying, "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine." Here are some meanings behind this phrase:

1. **Personal Relationship**: Calling us by name signifies a personal and intimate relationship between God and individuals. It emphasizes that God knows each person uniquely and personally, acknowledging their individual worth and identity.

2. **Divine Purpose**: It implies that God has a specific purpose and plan for each of our lives. By calling us by name, God invites us into a relationship where our purpose can be discovered and fulfilled.

3. **Assurance and Security**: This call provides assurance that we belong to God. In a world where people can often feel lost or anonymous, knowing that God knows our name is a source of comfort and security.

4. **Redemption and Belonging**: The context of the phrase points to God’s redemptive work, signifying that we are redeemed and belong to Him. It highlights the love and grace of God in actively seeking us out.

5. **Response to God’s Call**: Being called by name also invites a response. It encourages believers to reflect on how we can respond to God’s call, living out our faith and purpose in accordance with His will.

In summary, "God has called us by name" speaks to His intimate knowledge of us, His redemptive work, our belonging to Him, and the personal call each of us has to follow Him.
