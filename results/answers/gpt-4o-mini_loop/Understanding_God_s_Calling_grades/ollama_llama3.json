  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response accurately conveys the idea that being \"called\" by God means He has chosen and appointed us for His special purpose and work, which aligns with the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith. The addition of details such as general, individual, spiritual gifts, life circumstances, and assurance and purpose helps to provide a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to be \"called\" by God.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are that the response could benefit from a clearer articulation of how these different aspects of being \"called\" intersect and relate to one another. Additionally, while the response touches on the idea of assurance and purpose, it could delve deeper into how knowing one's calling can bring confidence and direction in life.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith."
