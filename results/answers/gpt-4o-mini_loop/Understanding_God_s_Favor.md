## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, particularly in the Gospel of Luke and other Gospels, Jesus' favor with God and men is underscored through various passages and events.

1. **Childhood of Jesus**: Luke 2:52 states, "And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man." This verse indicates that as Jesus matured, He grew not only in knowledge and physical health but also in His relationships with God and other people. His adherence to God's will and His loving interactions with others played a significant role in this accumulation of favor.

2. **Baptism and Transfiguration**: At Jesus' baptism (Matthew 3:16-17), God the Father publicly declares His approval of Jesus as the Holy Spirit descends upon Him. The voice from heaven proclaims, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." Similarly, during the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:5), God affirms Jesus’ identity and mission, emphasizing His intimate relationship with the Father, which is essential for understanding Jesus' favor with God.

3. **Teachings and Miracles**: Throughout the Gospels, Jesus demonstrated favor with people through His transformative teachings and compassionate miracles. For instance, in Luke 4:18-19, He proclaims His mission to bring good news to the poor, heal the brokenhearted, and proclaim freedom for the captives. His miracles—such as healing the sick (Matthew 9:35) and feeding the hungry (John 6:1-14)—reflected His love and compassion, which endeared Him to many, although He also faced challenges from various religious authorities.

4. **Prayer and Relationship with the Father**: Jesus consistently sought solitude to pray (Luke 5:16), showcasing His dependence on God and the depth of His relationship with the Father. This commitment to prayer was foundational to His life and ministry, illustrating His earnest desire to align with God’s will.

5. **Fulfillment of God’s Will**: Jesus emphasized the importance of doing the will of His Father in various passages (John 4:34; Matthew 26:39). His complete obedience and commitment to God's purpose, culminating in His sacrificial death and resurrection, demonstrates His favor with God. This act of redemption not only secured His standing with the Father but also offered salvation and favor to humanity.

6. **Sacrifice and Redemption**: Jesus' ultimate act of love—His sacrificial death on the cross—serves as the greatest demonstration of His favor with God and men (John 3:16). Through this sacrifice, He bridged the gap between God and humanity, offering reconciliation and hope, which deepens our understanding of His favor.

In summary, Jesus shows favor with God through His obedience, prayer, and fulfillment of God’s divine purpose, while His teachings, miracles, and sacrificial love illustrate His favor with men.
