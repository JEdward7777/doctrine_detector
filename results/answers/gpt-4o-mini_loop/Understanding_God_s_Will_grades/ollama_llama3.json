  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive and biblical understanding of seeking God's will, covering various aspects such as prayer, Scripture, the Holy Spirit, community, circumstances, values, and priorities. The author also emphasizes the importance of confidence and trust in God's plan, which is crucial for people struggling with making decisions that honor Him.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the response could be even more specific about how to apply these principles in daily life. For example, what does it look like to \"submit our own desires to His will\" or \"trust in God's plan\"? Providing more concrete examples and practical tips would make this response even more helpful for individuals seeking guidance on making decisions that align with God's will.\n\nOverall, however, this response is well-written, easy to follow, and provides a solid foundation for understanding how to seek God's will in our daily lives."
