## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The Bible presents God's wrath as a profound aspect of His nature, characterized by both justice and holiness. Unlike human anger, which can be impulsive and often irrational, influenced by personal offense, God's wrath is always righteous, measured, and aligned with His perfect justice and holiness.

1. **Righteousness and Justice**: God's wrath is a righteous response to sin and injustice, reflecting His holiness and desire for righteousness. Romans 1:18 states, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men," highlighting that God's wrath is directed toward sin rather than personal grievances.

2. **Purpose of Divine Wrath**: God's wrath is not simply punitive; it serves a redemptive purpose aimed at correction and repentance. In 2 Peter 3:9, we see Godâ€™s patience: "not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance." This reflects His desire for restoration rather than mere retribution.

3. **Controlled and Righteous**: Unlike human anger, which can be uncontrollable and stem from selfish motives, God's anger is perfectly controlled, seeking to uphold divine order. James 1:20 emphasizes this by stating, "for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God," underscoring the essential difference between human and divine anger.

4. **Expression of Love**: God's wrath can also be understood as an expression of His love for what is good. Like a loving parent who disciplines a child, God's wrath is motivated by a desire for holiness and justice. Hebrews 12:6 teaches, "For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives."

5. **Eschatological Context**: The Bible portrays God's wrath in the context of end times when ultimate justice will be realized. Revelation 20:11-15 describes the final judgment, wherein God's wrath is executed against sin and rebellion.

In summary, while human anger is often flawed and self-centered, God's wrath is a just and purposeful response to sin that aligns with His character, ultimately seeking to restore rather than merely punish. Understanding this distinction enriches our appreciation of God's dealings with humanity, harmonizing justice, mercy, and love.
