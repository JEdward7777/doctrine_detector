  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation of the nature of God's wrath as portrayed in the Bible. The student effectively contrasts God's wrath with human anger, emphasizing the righteousness, control, redemptive purpose, and love behind God's wrath. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses further strengthens the response. One suggestion for improvement could be to delve deeper into the concept of God's wrath in relation to His attributes such as omnipotence and omniscience, to further highlight the divine nature of His wrath."
