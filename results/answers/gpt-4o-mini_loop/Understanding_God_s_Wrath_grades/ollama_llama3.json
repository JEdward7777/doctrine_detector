The writing effectively uses biblical examples to illustrate this concept, such as Romans 1:18, 2 Peter 3:9, James 1:20, and Hebrews 12:6. Additionally, the response provides a nuanced understanding of God's wrath as both corrective and redemptive, highlighting its purpose in upholding divine order.\n\nThe response also shows an ability to distinguish between human anger and God's wrath, acknowledging that human anger can be sinful while emphasizing that God's wrath is always just and holy. The summary statement effectively synthesizes the main points, reinforcing the understanding of God's wrath as a harmonious balance of justice, mercy, and love.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to further develop the eschatological context, providing more depth and detail on how God's wrath is portrayed in the Bible's end times narratives. Overall, the response provides a strong foundation for understanding God's wrath and its significance within a Christian worldview."
