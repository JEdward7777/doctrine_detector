The inclusion of Biblical references and the explanation of the redemptive purpose of divine wrath further deepen the understanding of this aspect of God's character. The response effectively conveys how God's wrath differs from human anger and emphasizes its role in upholding justice, holiness, and ultimately, in seeking restoration."
