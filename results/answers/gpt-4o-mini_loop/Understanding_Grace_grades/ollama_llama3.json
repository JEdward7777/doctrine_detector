  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response effectively clarifies the concept of God's unmerited favor, accurately defining grace as \"the help or blessing given by God to sinful human beings that is freely bestowed and not earned.\" This definition aligns well with the concern to highlight God's unconditional love and mercy.\n\nWhile the response could be improved by providing more biblical support and further exploring the implications of grace in Christian theology, it provides a solid foundation for understanding this essential concept. The mention of Ephesians 2:8-9 is a notable strength, as it provides Scriptural evidence for the idea that salvation is a gift from God, not earned through human effort.\n\nTo reach a perfect score, the response could be expanded to include more depth and analysis of the role of grace in Christian living, such as its connection to sanctification and the importance of resting in God's unmerited favor. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of grace and its significance in a Christian worldview."
