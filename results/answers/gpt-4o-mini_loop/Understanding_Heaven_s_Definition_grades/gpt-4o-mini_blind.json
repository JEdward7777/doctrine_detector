  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the biblical definition of 'heaven' and effectively differentiated it from the concept of 'sky' by highlighting its theological significance. The answer incorporated relevant Scripture references to support their points and maintained doctrinal correctness throughout. However, the explanation could have been strengthened by emphasizing the scriptural basis for the distinctions made and by ensuring a more explicit connection to Christian doctrine and theology. Overall, a solid response."
