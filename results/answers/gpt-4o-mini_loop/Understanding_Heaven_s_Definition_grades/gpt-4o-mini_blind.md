## [Answer](../Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, the term "heaven" has multiple meanings and is used in various contexts. Generally, "heaven" can refer to:

1. **The Dwelling Place of God**: Heaven is depicted in Scripture as the eternal and spiritual realm where God resides and governs. For example, Psalm 115:16 states, "The heavens are the Lord's heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of man." This illustrates the concept of heaven as a realm that belongs to God, distinct from the earthly realm.

2. **The Eternal Home of the Righteous**: Heaven is described as the ultimate destination for believers, characterized by eternal life in God's presence. Revelation 21:1-4 provides a vision of a new heaven and new earth, stating, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God." This passage emphasizes the intimate relationship that believers will have with God in eternity.

3. **The Cosmic Expanse**: The term "heavens" can also refer to the physical universe or the "sky." For instance, Genesis 1:1 begins with, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth," highlighting the creation of the physical realm we observe.

The distinction between "heaven" and "sky" can be summarized as follows:

- **Heaven** (in a theological sense) refers to a spiritual realm where God's presence is fully manifest, and it is associated with eternal life and the afterlife for believers. Additional passages such as Matthew 5:12, where Jesus speaks of "great is your reward in heaven," further illustrate this idea.
- **Sky** is typically understood as the atmospheric expanse above the Earth, where we see clouds, stars, and other celestial bodies. It represents the physical realm observable from our earthly perspective.

In summary, while "sky" pertains primarily to the physical, observable atmosphere and celestial bodies, "heaven" encompasses a broader theological significance related to God's presence, majesty, and the eternal destiny of believers. This understanding invites us to reflect on the profound nature of our relationship with God and the hope of eternity in His glorious presence.
