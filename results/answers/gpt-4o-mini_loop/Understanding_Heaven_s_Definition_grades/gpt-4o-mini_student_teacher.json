  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-explained answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical concepts of \"heaven\" and \"sky.\" They effectively address the concern of understanding the different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture and how they impact our relationship with God. The student's response includes relevant biblical references and explanations, connecting the theological significance of \"heaven\" with God's presence and the eternal destiny of believers. However, the response could have been improved by directly contrasting the student's explanation with the reference answer, highlighting any differences with a clearer emphasis on the Christian worldview perspective. Overall, a strong and insightful answer."
