The answer effectively draws on key biblical passages, the concept of covenant relationship, the promise of eternal life and spiritual blessings, and the responsibilities that come with being heirs. The integration of relevant scripture verses and theological concepts demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
