  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of God's absolute holiness and its implications on our relationship with Him. They effectively explain the nature of God's holiness and its impact on human sinfulness, the need for atonement, the call to holiness, the relationship dynamics of reverence and love, and the transformative grace offered through Christ. The student provides scriptural references to support their points, showcasing a rich understanding of Christian theology in relation to God's holiness. The only slight deduction is for not directly referencing that we cannot approach God without His allowance due to our sinful nature, as stated in the reference answer."
