  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This is a well-written response that provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression. The student effectively differentiates between the terms and supports their explanations with relevant biblical references. The only area for improvement would be to perhaps delve deeper into the theological implications of these distinctions and how they relate to concepts such as redemption and atonement. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound answer."
