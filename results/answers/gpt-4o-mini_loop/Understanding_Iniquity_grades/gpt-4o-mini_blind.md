**What is the biblical distinction between iniquity, sin, and transgression?**

In the Bible, the terms iniquity, sin, and transgression have distinct meanings, though they are often used interchangeably in casual conversation. Here’s a brief overview of each term:

1. **Sin**: This is the broadest term, encompassing any action, thought, or attitude that goes against God's commands and moral laws. It represents a state of separation from God and includes all forms of wrongdoing. In the New Testament, sin can be understood as "missing the mark," which is reflected in the Greek word "hamartia." Romans 3:23 states, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," highlighting the universal nature of human sinfulness.

2. **Transgression**: This term refers to a specific act of violating a known commandment or law, implying willful disobedience or rebellion against God's authority. The Hebrew word commonly translated as "transgression" conveys the idea of crossing boundaries or overstepping established laws. For example, 1 John 3:4 asserts, "Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness," emphasizing the aspect of knowingly breaking God’s laws.

3. **Iniquity**: This term often carries a heavier connotation of moral evil or wickedness. It can indicate the habitual or persistent nature of sin and emphasizes the consequences stemming from profound immorality or injustice. Iniquity may denote a morally corrupted state, as seen in Psalm 51:2, where David implores, "Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin." This reflects a deep awareness of the need for cleansing and redemption.

In summary, while all three terms address wrongdoing, they focus on different aspects: sin is the overarching term for moral failure, transgression highlights the act of breaking law, and iniquity stresses moral depravity and the consequences of sin. Understanding these distinctions can enrich one’s grasp of biblical teachings on morality and human behavior in relation to God.
