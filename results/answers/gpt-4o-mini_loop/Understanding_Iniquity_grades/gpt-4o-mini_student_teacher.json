  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression. They demonstrated a good understanding of the nuances of each term and how they relate to moral conduct and God's commands. The inclusion of relevant biblical references and theological insights enhances the depth of their response. However, the slight deviation in the definition of iniquity from the reference answer slightly impacts the grade. Nonetheless, the student's answer exhibits a strong grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
