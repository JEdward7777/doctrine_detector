  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported explanation of the concept of innocence in the context of wrongful accusation according to biblical teachings. They referenced relevant biblical examples such as Job and Jesus, and demonstrated a strong understanding of the theological implications of innocence. The answer effectively tied in key biblical passages and themes to support their argument. The response could have been slightly improved by directly addressing the concern raised in the question regarding the implications of innocence for justice and mercy in Christian teachings."
