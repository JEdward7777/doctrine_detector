  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the significance of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. They have effectively highlighted the theological implications and the divine authority associated with the term. The student's response aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the sovereignty and authority of God and Jesus. However, the reference answer simplifies the explanation by focusing on ownership or authority, which the student could have touched on more explicitly. Overall, the student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic, earning a high grade."
