  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the theological significance of the term \"Lord\" in the Bible, particularly in relation to both God the Father and Jesus Christ. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the authority and divinity associated with the term \"Lord\" in recognizing Jesus and God. This response demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian doctrine and effectively integrates scriptural references to support the theological implications presented."
