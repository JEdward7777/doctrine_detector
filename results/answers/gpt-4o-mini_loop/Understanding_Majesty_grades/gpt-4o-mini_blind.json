The answer effectively highlighted God's supreme greatness, authority, and perfection, while also emphasizing the connection between God's majesty and His attributes such as holiness, power, and glory. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references further enriched the response, grounding the explanation in biblical support. Well done!"
