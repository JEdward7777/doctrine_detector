The term 'majesty' in relation to God's character signifies His supreme greatness, authority, and perfection. It reflects His transcendence and sovereignty over all creation, highlighting the divine attributes that set God apart from His creation. In Scripture, majesty is often associated with God's holiness, power, and glory.

For example, Psalm 93:1 states, "The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed, he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved." This verse illustrates how God's majesty is intimately connected to His reign and strength, portraying Him as both powerful and just.

In the New Testament, the concept of majesty finds its expression in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies the fullness of Godâ€™s glory. John 1:14 affirms this, saying, "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth." Hebrews 1:3 further describes Christ as "the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature," indicating that Jesus reveals the majesty of God in a tangible way to humanity.

In summary, 'majesty' signifies God's greatness and authority, encapsulating His divine nature, sovereign rule, and glorious presence, which invites reverence and worship from His creation.
