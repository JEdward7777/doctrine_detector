  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that effectively explains the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character, emphasizing His greatness, authority, and perfection. The student also connected the concept of majesty to relevant biblical passages and tied it to the attributes of holiness, power, and glory. Additionally, the student successfully integrated Christian teachings by discussing the expression of majesty in Jesus Christ. However, the student's response could have been more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
