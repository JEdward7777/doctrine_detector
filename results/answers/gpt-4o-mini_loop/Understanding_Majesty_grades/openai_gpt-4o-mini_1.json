  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character, delving into both the Old and New Testament references to show how it signifies His greatness, authority, sovereignty, and glory. The incorporation of scriptural examples enhances the understanding of God's attributes and His sovereignty over creation within a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be a more explicit connection to the supreme kingship and rulership of God over the universe as mentioned in the given answer. Overall, a strong and insightful response from a Christian perspective."
