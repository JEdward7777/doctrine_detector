  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85 \n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and thoughtful overview of ways to demonstrate mercy in daily life, drawing upon biblical references and principles. The student effectively highlights key aspects of mercy such as forgiveness, compassion, service, understanding, advocacy for justice, prayer, and non-judgmental attitudes. The inclusion of Scripture verses reinforces the Christian perspective on mercy. However, the response could benefit from deeper theological reflection on the significance of mercy within the context of Christian salvation and the atoning work of Christ. Emphasizing the relationship between God's mercy and the redemptive work on the cross could enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer. Overall, a strong submission with room for further theological depth."
