  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of how to embody mercy in daily life, aligning with God's merciful nature. The student effectively incorporates biblical references to support their points and offers practical examples for each suggestion. However, the student's answer is quite detailed and elaborate, which may slightly detract from the simplicity and directness of the reference answer provided by the teacher. Simplifying and focusing on the core aspects of demonstrating mercy could have enhanced the clarity and conciseness of the response. Nonetheless, the student's thoughtful insights and scriptural grounding merit a high grade for their thorough discussion on embodying God's merciful nature in interactions with others."
