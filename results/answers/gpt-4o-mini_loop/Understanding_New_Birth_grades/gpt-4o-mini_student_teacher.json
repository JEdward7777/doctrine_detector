  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of being \"born again\" according to the Bible, delving into the spiritual transformation, the role of the Holy Spirit, repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, and the ramifications of this new birth on one's relationship with God. The only suggestion for improvement would be to more explicitly tie the answer back to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
