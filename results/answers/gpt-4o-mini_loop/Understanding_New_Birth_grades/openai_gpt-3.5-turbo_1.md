## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the Bible, the phrase "born again" primarily originates from the conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus in the Gospel of John, specifically John 3:3-7. Jesus tells Nicodemus, "Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again," and further explains that this new birth is a spiritual rebirth, not a physical one.

To be "born again" means to undergo a transformation through the Holy Spirit, resulting in a new spiritual life. This process is deeply associated with repentance—a sincere turning away from sin—and faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. The concept reflects regeneration, which is the work of the Holy Spirit that brings a person from spiritual death to spiritual life.

Theological understanding emphasizes that being born again signifies a fundamental change in one's relationship with God. It represents a turning away from sin and a commitment to follow Christ closely. This spiritual transformation reshapes one's identity, allowing individuals to recognize themselves as children of God. Following this new birth, believers are called to live according to God's will, characterized by ongoing spiritual growth and a desire to align their lives with biblical teachings.

In summary, being "born again" according to the Bible signifies a profound spiritual renewal through the Holy Spirit, enabling individuals to enter into a personal relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ, and to live a life marked by obedience and devotion to Him.
