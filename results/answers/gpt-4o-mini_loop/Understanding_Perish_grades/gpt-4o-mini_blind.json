The student effectively references key scripture verses, such as John 3:16 and Matthew 10:28, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the theological concepts of sin, judgment, atonement, and the consequences of spiritual separation from God. The response could be further enhanced by exploring the aspect of God's justice and holiness in contrast to His love and mercy, which are essential elements in understanding the concept of perishing."
