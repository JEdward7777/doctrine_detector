  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern by clearly explaining how Jesus' sacrifice relates to God's justice and mercy through the concept of propitiation. The writer provides a thorough overview of the Old Testament sacrificial system, its connection to Jesus' sacrifice in the New Testament, and the significance of His death on the cross in satisfying God's wrath and providing reconciliation.\n\nThe response also includes relevant biblical passages to support its claims, which adds credibility and helps to illustrate the point being made. The writer's use of key terms such as \"propitiation,\" \"atonement,\" and \"reconciliation\" demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concepts involved.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are in terms of organization and clarity. Some of the paragraphs seem to meander slightly, and it would be helpful to have more explicit transitions between ideas. Additionally, some of the supporting biblical passages could be woven in more seamlessly to avoid interrupting the flow of the text.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides a clear and compelling explanation of the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in propitiation."
