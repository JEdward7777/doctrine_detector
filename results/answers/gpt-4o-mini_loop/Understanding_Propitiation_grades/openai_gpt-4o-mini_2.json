It effectively connects the concepts of propitiation, justice, and mercy within a Christian worldview, highlighting the multifaceted nature of Jesus' sacrifice. The only minor area for improvement could be to include a direct reference to the connection between God's justice and mercy within the explanation, to further clarify the relationship between propitiation and these attributes of God."
