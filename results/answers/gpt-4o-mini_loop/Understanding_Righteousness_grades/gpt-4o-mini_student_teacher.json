  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of God's righteousness and its various implications, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer focuses more on the positive aspects of God's righteousness, such as moral perfection, justice, covenantal faithfulness, holiness, and salvation, without explicitly mentioning the necessity of condemning sin. Emphasizing the condemnation of sin is crucial in understanding the full extent of God's righteousness, as it demonstrates His perfect standard and the consequences of falling short of it.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of God's righteousness, but could enhance the answer by incorporating the aspect of sin condemnation as highlighted in the reference answer."
