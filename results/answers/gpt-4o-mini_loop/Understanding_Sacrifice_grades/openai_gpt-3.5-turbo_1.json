It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting key theological points and the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death in fulfilling God's plan for redemption. The response could be enhanced by further emphasizing the divine aspect of Jesus' sacrifice and the deeper spiritual implications beyond the historical context."
