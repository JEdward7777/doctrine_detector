## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the context of the Christian faith, the name "Satan" originates from the Hebrew word "שָּׂטָן" (satan), which means "adversary" or "accuser." He is often depicted in the biblical narrative as a being who opposes God and seeks to lead humanity away from righteousness.

Satan is commonly associated with temptation, deception, and opposition to God’s purposes. In the New Testament, he is portrayed as the ultimate source of evil, temptation, and spiritual conflict. For instance, in the Gospels, Satan tempts Jesus in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11) and is referred to as the "father of lies" (John 8:44).

In Christian theology, Satan has various roles, such as a tempter, enticing individuals to sin; an accuser, bringing charges against humanity before God; and a ruler of the powers of darkness (Ephesians 6:12). However, it is crucial to note that Christian belief maintains that Satan's power is limited. Through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, believers affirm that he has been ultimately defeated, signifying the triumph of good over evil and the hope of redemption for humanity.
