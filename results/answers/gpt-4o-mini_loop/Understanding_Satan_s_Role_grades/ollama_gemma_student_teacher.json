It provides accurate definitions from the Hebrew origin, highlighting the notion of an adversary or accuser. The student also effectively connects this meaning to the biblical narrative and Christian theology. However, including a brief elaboration on the symbolic or spiritual significance of the name would further enhance the quality of the response."
