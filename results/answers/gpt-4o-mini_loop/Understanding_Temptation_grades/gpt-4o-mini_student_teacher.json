  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of Jesus' strategies to resist temptation, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer provided by the teacher. The reference answer focused specifically on scripture and unwavering faith, while the student's response included additional strategies such as faithfulness to His mission, prayer, recognition of the nature of temptation, reliance on the Holy Spirit, and preparation through fasting. These additional insights enrich the understanding of how Jesus combated temptation, aligning well with a Christian worldview.\n\nOverall, the student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic and effectively relates it to combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ."
