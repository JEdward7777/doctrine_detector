  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive and biblical analysis of Jesus' strategies for resisting temptation, drawing from specific passages in Matthew and Luke. The writer identifies six key strategies employed by Jesus, including Scripture application, faithfulness to His mission, prayer and connection with God, recognizing the nature of temptation, relying on the Holy Spirit, and preparation through fasting.\n\nThe response is well-organized, clear, and concise, making it easy to follow the author's arguments. The use of biblical examples and references adds depth and authority to the discussion.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to daily life as a follower of Christ. While the strategies discussed are certainly applicable in daily life, the writer could have done more to explicitly illustrate how these principles can be applied in practical ways.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that provides valuable insights and practical applications for combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ."
