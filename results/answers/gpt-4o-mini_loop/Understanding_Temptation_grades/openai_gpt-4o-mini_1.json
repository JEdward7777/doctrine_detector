  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of how Jesus resisted temptation by using scripture, faithfulness to God, prayer, understanding the nature of temptation, reliance on the Holy Spirit, and preparation through fasting. The strategies discussed are relevant and practical for Christians in combating temptation in their daily lives. The only minor suggestion would be to explicitly connect each strategy to its practical application in resisting temptation, but overall, the response effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview."
