It not only expands on how Jesus used scripture and faith to combat temptation but also delves into additional strategies such as maintaining a close relationship with God, relying on the Holy Spirit, and preparing through fasting. The inclusion of practical applications for Christians facing temptation in their daily lives demonstrates a strong understanding of combating temptation within a Christian worldview. Great job!"
