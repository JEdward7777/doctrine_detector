## [Answer](../Understanding_Transgression.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In a Biblical context, the term "transgress" refers to the act of violating or exceeding the boundaries established by God, particularly concerning His commandments, moral laws, or covenantal obligations. It reflects a willful disobedience or rebellion against God's divine will.

The Hebrew word often translated as "transgress" is *pāša‘*, which conveys the idea of breaking trust or acting treacherously. In the New Testament, the Greek term *parabasis* is also relevant, as it denotes a breach of law or an infringement upon established standards.

Theologically, transgression represents a serious offense that alienates an individual from God, often resulting in spiritual consequences. It underscores the significance of holiness and obedience in the life of a believer. Moreover, it highlights the essential need for repentance and reconciliation with God through His grace, as emphasized in the teachings on sin and redemption throughout Scripture. This understanding calls Christians to reflect on their relationship with God and actively seek forgiveness and restoration when they fall short.
