  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that thoroughly explores the relationship between trespass and sin in a Christian worldview. They effectively connected the theological concepts of sin, trespass, and the sacrificial system, demonstrating a strong grasp of Christian ethics. The answer effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding how interpersonal violations relate to sin against God in Christian ethics. The only minor improvement could be more directly aligning the initial definition provided with the concise reference answer from the teacher. Overall, an excellent response."
