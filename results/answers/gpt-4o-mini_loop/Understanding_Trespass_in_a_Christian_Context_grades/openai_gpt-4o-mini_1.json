  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the concept of trespass in a Christian worldview, linking it to sin and emphasizing the importance of understanding the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God. The integration of biblical references and theological insights enhances the depth of the analysis. The connection to the sacrificial system and the restorative perspective further enrich the discussion. The only minor improvement could be to incorporate more explicit examples or illustrations to strengthen the clarity of the explanation."
