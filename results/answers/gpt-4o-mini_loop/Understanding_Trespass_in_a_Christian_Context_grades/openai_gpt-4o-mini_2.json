It effectively clarifies the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God, emphasizing the importance of understanding Christian ethics within this framework. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more specific biblical examples illustrating how trespass relates to both interpersonal violations and sin against God to enhance the clarity and depth of the argument."
