## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
An 'unholy' life, from a Christian theological perspective, is characterized by behaviors, attitudes, and desires that oppose the teachings of Scripture and the nature of God. Some common traits associated with an unholy life include:

1. **Moral Relativism**: An unholy life often embraces the belief that right and wrong are subjective and vary based on personal or societal standards, rather than adhering to the eternal truths found in Scripture.

2. **Rebellion Against God**: This includes actively rejecting God's authority and commandments, which may manifest in willful disobedience to biblical principles such as dishonesty, immorality, and idolatry.

3. **Pursuit of Sinful Desires**: Prioritizing fleshly desires over spiritual well-being is a hallmark of an unholy life. Paul lists various "acts of the flesh" in Galatians 5:19-21, including sexual immorality, impurity, and hatred.

4. **Lack of Love**: An unholy life often lacks the selfless, sacrificial love that Jesus exemplified. It is marked by selfishness, bitterness, unforgiveness, and a failure to love one’s neighbor, as commanded in Matthew 22:37-39.

5. **Worldly Values**: An inclination toward societal influences that prioritize materialism, pride, and self-centeredness indicates an unholy mindset. This aligns with the "spirit of the age" rather than the values of the Kingdom of God (1 John 2:15-17).

6. **Dishonesty and Deceit**: An unholy life is often characterized by lying, manipulation, and deceitfulness in contrast to the truthfulness central to a life centered on Christ (Ephesians 4:25).

7. **Lack of Accountability**: Evading accountability to God and others often marks an unholy lifestyle, as individuals avoid community and fellowship that encourage righteous living, as highlighted in Hebrews 10:24-25.

To assess our own actions or the state of society, we can identify these characteristics in several ways:

- **Scripture Reflection**: Regularly read and meditate on Scripture, allowing God's Word to act as a mirror that reflects our inner thoughts and behaviors.
  
- **Self-Examination**: Engage in personal introspection and prayer, inviting the Holy Spirit to reveal areas of unholiness in our hearts and lives (Psalm 139:23-24).

- **Community Feedback**: Be open to input from trusted Christian friends or mentors who can share insights regarding our spiritual health.

- **Awareness of Cultural Trends**: Observe and critically assess societal norms and values in light of biblical truth, identifying areas that may lead us away from holiness.

Striving for a holy life involves repenting from unholy practices and seeking God’s help through prayer, fellowship, and engagement with Scripture, cultivating a life that reflects His love, righteousness, and truth.
