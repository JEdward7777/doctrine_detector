## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The term "woe" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments signifies a state of deep distress or lamentation. It is often used to convey God's displeasure or impending judgment against sin, disobedience, or injustice. In the Scriptures, "woe" serves as a solemn warning, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation and the consequences that follow unfaithfulness or rebellion against God's commandments.

In the prophetic books of the Old Testament, prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah use "woe" to announce judgment upon nations and individuals who have turned away from God. For instance, Isaiah 5:8-30 includes a series of "woes" directed at those who are greedy, unjust, and who rage against God's commands. Similarly, in the New Testament, Jesus employs the term to express sorrow and impending judgment for those who refuse to repent. In Matthew 23, He pronounces "woes" upon the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy and failure to lead others correctly.

Ultimately, "woe" functions as a call to repentance, urging individuals and communities to recognize their sinful state and return to God before it is too late. It encapsulates both the compassion of God, who warns His people of the consequences of their actions, and the righteousness of God, who judges sin with certainty and justice. Thus, the term "woe" invites believers to respond to God's love by turning away from sin and seeking restoration in relationship with Him.
