The student effectively connects the use of \"woe\" in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting its significance in conveying God's displeasure and impending judgment against sin. The explanation is clear, supported by relevant biblical examples, and concludes with a strong emphasis on the call to repentance. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound analysis. Great job!"
