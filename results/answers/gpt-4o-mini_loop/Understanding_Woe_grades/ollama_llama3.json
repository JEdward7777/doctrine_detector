  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response accurately captures the essence of what \"woe\" means in the biblical context, conveying a sense of deep distress and serving as a warning for sin and judgment. The example from Isaiah 5:8-30 and Matthew 23 demonstrates a good understanding of how prophets and Jesus used this term to highlight the consequences of disobedience. Additionally, the response effectively connects \"woe\" to the concept of repentance, emphasizing the importance of recognizing one's sinful state and seeking restoration with God.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have explored the implications of \"woe\" in more depth. For instance, it could have discussed how this term relates to other biblical themes, such as God's sovereignty, human responsibility, or the concept of eschatological judgment. Nonetheless, the overall quality of the response and its relevance to the concern about understanding biblical warnings related to sin and judgment earn it a high grade."
