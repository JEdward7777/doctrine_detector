It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how \"woe\" signifies distress and serves as a warning of suffering as a consequence of sin. The analysis of biblical examples from both the Old Testament and the New Testament enriches the response and demonstrates a solid understanding of the implications of biblical warnings regarding sin and judgment from a Christian worldview. Well done!"
