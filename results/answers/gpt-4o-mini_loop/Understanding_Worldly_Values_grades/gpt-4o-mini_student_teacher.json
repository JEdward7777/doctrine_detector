  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85. The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term 'worldly' according to Christian teachings, including references to relevant biblical passages and the role of the Holy Spirit in overcoming worldly influences. While the student effectively discusses the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, the answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the explicitly negative connotations of 'worldly' behaviors in Christian teachings, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. By focusing more on the inherently negative aspects of worldly values, the student could enhance the depth of their analysis."
