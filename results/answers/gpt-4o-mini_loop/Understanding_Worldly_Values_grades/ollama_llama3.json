  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of highlighting the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, using biblical examples to illustrate the point. It correctly identifies that being \"worldly\" means being influenced by secular or materialistic pursuits rather than spiritual or divine principles. The discussion on how Christians are not left to navigate these influences on their own, but can rely on the transformative power of the Holy Spirit, is also well-handled.\n\nHowever, the response could have been more explicit in drawing out the contrast between worldly values and godly principles. While it mentions that \"worldly\" behaviors and values reflect a focus on the temporal and material, often at the expense of spiritual growth, it could have done more to highlight the specific ways in which this is opposed to God's will.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good overview of the concept of being \"worldly\" from a Christian perspective and does a great job of emphasizing the importance of seeking the things of God rather than conforming to the patterns of this world."
