  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of being 'worldly' from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the contrast between worldly values and godly principles. The biblical references are effectively used to support the explanation, and the role of the Holy Spirit in helping believers overcome worldly tendencies is clearly articulated. The response effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on how worldly behaviors diverge from godly principles and the importance of seeking spiritual growth and obedience to God."
