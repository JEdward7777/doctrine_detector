  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the differences between Sheol and Hades in the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. The student effectively distinguishes between Sheol and Hades, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments to support their points. The theological implications for believers and non-believers are well articulated. One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate arbiter of destinies in the afterlife, highlighting the centrality of faith in Him for salvation. Overall, a well-written and informative response from a Christian worldview perspective."
