  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive explanation of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. They demonstrate a clear understanding of the distinction between the two terms and how they have been interpreted within biblical context. Additionally, the student ties in Christian doctrine regarding the ultimate destinies of believers and non-believers based on faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the teacher's provided answer and emphasizing the evolving understanding of Sheol and Hades over time, particularly in relation to the fate of the righteous and unrighteous. By incorporating this aspect, the student's response would have aligned more closely with the concern specified in the question."
