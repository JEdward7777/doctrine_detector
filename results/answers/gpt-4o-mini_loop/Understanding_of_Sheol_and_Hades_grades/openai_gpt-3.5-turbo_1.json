  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the Bible, highlighting the distinction between the destinies of the righteous and the unrighteous after death. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how Hades is associated more closely with judgment and torment for the unrighteous, contrasting with the righteous who are comforted. The integration of Christian doctrine regarding the final destinies of believers and non-believers adds depth to the explanation. Overall, a well-structured and insightful response from a Christian worldview perspective."
