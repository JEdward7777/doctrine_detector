  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the significance of Jesus Christ as the \"cornerstone\" in the context of the Assembly of believers. They effectively connected scriptural references and theological points to highlight Jesus' foundational role in the Church. The answer demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and effectively addressed the concern about how this understanding can impact a believer's faith and community involvement. The only area for improvement would be to directly align their explanation with the concise reference answer provided by the teacher."
