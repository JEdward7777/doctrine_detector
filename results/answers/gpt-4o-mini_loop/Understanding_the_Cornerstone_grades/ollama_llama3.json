  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of Jesus' role as the cornerstone of the Church, accurately referencing various biblical passages to support its points. The writer effectively highlights Jesus' foundational role in the spiritual structure of the Church, emphasizing His importance for unity, spiritual authority, and fulfillment of prophecy. The response also explores the implications of Jesus being the cornerstone, including its impact on believers' faith and community involvement.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more concise in its presentation. While the writer provides a thorough explanation, some points feel slightly repetitive or could be combined for greater clarity. Nevertheless, this response admirably conveys the significance of Christ's role as the cornerstone and its impact on believers' faith and community involvement.\n\nTo achieve a perfect score, the writer might consider streamlining their arguments and providing more explicit connections between Jesus being the cornerstone and the concern about understanding His role in the church."
