  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive and well-explained analysis of the significance of Jesus Christ being appointed as the judge on the Day of Judgment. They effectively incorporate key Christian theological concepts and relevant biblical references to support their points. However, the student's answer goes beyond the reference answer by discussing additional themes and implications, offering a deeper exploration of the topic. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the subject matter but could be further improved by directly linking some of the discussed themes back to the core idea presented in the reference answer."
