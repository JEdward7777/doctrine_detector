  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained analysis of the term \"house of God\" in biblical context, including both the literal and metaphorical meanings as well as the overall significance. They have appropriately drawn from Old and New Testament references to support their explanation. However, the answer could be enhanced by incorporating more direct references from Scripture to strengthen their points further and align closely with the teacher's reference answer."
