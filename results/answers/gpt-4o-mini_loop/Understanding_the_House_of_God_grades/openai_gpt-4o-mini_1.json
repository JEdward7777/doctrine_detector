  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance and meaning of the \"house of God\" in Scripture, incorporating both literal and metaphorical interpretations. It effectively addresses the concern by delving into the Old and New Testament contexts, illustrating the importance of physical structures like the Tabernacle and Temple, as well as the collective body of believers as the house of God. The citation of relevant biblical passages strengthens the response and demonstrates a sound understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job in providing a well-rounded perspective on the concept."
