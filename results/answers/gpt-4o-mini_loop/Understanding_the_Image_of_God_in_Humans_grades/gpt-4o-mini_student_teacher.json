  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed answer that aligns well with the biblical understanding of the image of God. The response effectively covers a wide range of characteristics and supports them with relevant biblical references. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the eternal nature of the human spirit as stated in the teacher's reference answer."
