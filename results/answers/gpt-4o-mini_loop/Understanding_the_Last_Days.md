## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The concept of the "last days" in Christian theology signifies a pivotal period concerning the first and second comings of Jesus Christ. This time is marked by the fulfillment of God's promises and the anticipation of His ultimate plan for humanity.

1. **Jesus' First Coming**: The "last days" commenced with the advent of Jesus Christ. The New Testament, particularly through the words of the Apostle Peter in Acts 2:17, cites the prophet Joel to indicate that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was a prophetic fulfillment of the "last days." This period represents the inauguration of a new era in God's redemptive history, where through His life, death, and resurrection, Jesus initiated the fulfillment of God's promises. The "last days" signify an era of hope, grace, and the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth through Christ's ministry.

2. **Jesus' Second Coming**: In the eschatological framework, the "last days" also encompass the time leading up to Jesus' second coming. This period is characterized by signs, tribulations, and the fulfillment of biblical prophecies that herald His return. Key texts, such as Matthew 24 and Revelation, detail the events and signs preceding the second coming of Christ, highlighting the importance of vigilance and readiness among believers.

Theologically, the "last days" represent a unique time of spiritual conflict, the spread of the Gospel, and a deep longing for ultimate restoration. Christians look forward to Christ’s glorious return, where He will judge the living and the dead, culminating in the establishment of God’s eternal Kingdom.

In conclusion, the "last days" encapsulate both the fulfillment birthed by Jesus' first coming and the optimistic expectation of His second coming. This significant transition in God's redemptive narrative shapes the unfolding of history and leads believers toward the ultimate realization of His divine purpose.
