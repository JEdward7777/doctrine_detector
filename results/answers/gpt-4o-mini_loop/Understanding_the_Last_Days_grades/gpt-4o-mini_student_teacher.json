  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer that demonstrates a strong understanding of the theological significance of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings. The response effectively discusses key aspects such as the fulfillment of prophecies, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the anticipation of Christ's return. However, the answer could be improved by aligning more closely with the reference answer in terms of conciseness and directly stating that the \"last days\" span from Jesus' first coming to His second coming. Overall, a solid understanding is displayed, but there is room for slight refinement in clarity and focus."
