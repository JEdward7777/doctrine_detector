## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Name_of_God_2.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The name "Yahweh" signifies the personal, covenantal name of God in the context of the Old Testament. It is derived from the Hebrew verb "hayah," meaning "to be" or "to exist," and is often interpreted to convey Godâ€™s eternal nature, self-existence, and faithfulness to His creation.

In Exodus 3:14, when God reveals His name to Moses from the burning bush, He states, "I AM WHO I AM," emphasizing His unchanging and eternal essence. This revelation not only establishes God's identity but also signifies His relational aspect, highlighting His commitment to His people and His desire to engage intimately with them.

Throughout the Old Testament, "Yahweh" is associated with God's active involvement in history, particularly in the covenant relationships with figures such as Abraham, Moses, and the nation of Israel. This name encapsulates attributes such as holiness, mercy, justice, and sovereignty, underscoring its importance in the lives of the Israelites and their worship practices.

In summary, "Yahweh" serves as a pivotal name in the Old Testament, embodying God's character, His relationship with humanity, and His enduring promises to His people, thereby enriching the understanding of His interaction with creation throughout biblical history.
