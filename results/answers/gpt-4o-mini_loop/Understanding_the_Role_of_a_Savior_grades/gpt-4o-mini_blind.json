The student provides thorough explanations supported by relevant biblical references and demonstrates a clear understanding of the doctrinal significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of the Old Testament foreshadowing. The integration of key theological concepts, such as divine empowerment, covenant fulfillment, and justice, enriches the discussion. One suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the unique and unrepeatable nature of Jesus' salvific work compared to the temporal deliverance provided by the Old Testament judges."
