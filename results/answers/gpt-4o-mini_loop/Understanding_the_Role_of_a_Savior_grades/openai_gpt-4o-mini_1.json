The integration of specific Old Testament examples with New Testament truths, the emphasis on divine empowerment and fulfillment of the covenant through Jesus, and the recognition of Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets all contribute to a comprehensive and cohesive discussion of salvation within the Christian worldview."
