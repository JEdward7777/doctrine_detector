  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-articulated explanation of the differences between the human spirit and evil spirits according to the Bible. They have correctly highlighted the foundational aspects of each concept and supported their response with relevant biblical passages. However, to enhance the theological accuracy, the student could have integrated more scriptural references that explicitly contrast the human spirit with evil spirits to reinforce the distinction further. Overall, this response demonstrates a commendable understanding of the topic."
