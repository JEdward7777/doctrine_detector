The student effectively connects the term to Jesus' humanity, Old Testament origins, messianic implications, servant role, and eschatological significance. The explanation is coherent, well-supported with scriptural references, and demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian theological concepts related to Jesus' identity. Well done!"
