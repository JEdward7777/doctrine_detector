## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Title.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The title "Son of Man" holds profound significance in the context of Jesus' identity, encompassing a range of theological and biblical meanings.

1. **Humanity**: The term emphasizes Jesus' full humanity. By calling Himself the Son of Man, Jesus identifies with the human experience and serves as a representative of mankind. This title highlights that Jesus is not only divine but also fully human, which is foundational to Christian theology concerning the Incarnation.

2. **Old Testament Roots**: The phrase "Son of Man" has its origins in the Old Testament, particularly in the prophetic literature. In Ezekiel, the title is frequently used by God when addressing the prophet, emphasizing the human aspect of the messenger. This usage underscores the idea of a mediator between God and humanity. Additionally, in Psalm 8:4-6, the psalmist reflects on the dignity of mankind, stating that God made humans "a little lower than the angels." This background enriches the understanding of Jesus’ identification with humanity through the title.

3. **Messianic Reference**: The title carries strong messianic implications, especially from the book of Daniel. In Daniel 7:13-14, "one like a son of man" comes with the clouds of heaven and is given everlasting dominion and glory. This passage is understood by many Christians as pointing to Jesus as the Messiah, revealing His divine authority and role in establishing God's eternal kingdom, thus connecting His earthly ministry with His heavenly reign.

4. **Suffering Servant**: In the context of Jesus' mission, the title encapsulates the paradox of His role. While affirmed as the Messiah with authority, He also chose to serve and ultimately to suffer. In Mark 10:45, Jesus declares that the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, offering His life as a ransom for many. This service-oriented aspect emphasizes humility and sacrificial love, central to Jesus’ identity and purpose.

5. **Eschatological Focus**: The title "Son of Man" is linked with eschatological themes, particularly regarding the end times and final judgment. Jesus frequently refers to Himself as the Son of Man when speaking of His return and the inauguration of God's kingdom. This indicates His sovereign authority in the consummation of history and the redemption of creation.

In summary, the title "Son of Man" encapsulates Jesus' identity as both divine and human, ties to His Old Testament roots, affirms His role as the Messiah who serves and suffers, and emphasizes His authority in eschatology. This multifaceted title not only deepens our understanding of Jesus' mission but also illustrates His profound relationship with humanity and His divine purpose in God's plan for redemption.
