  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that delves into various aspects of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man'. They effectively address the humanity, Old Testament roots, messianic reference, suffering servant aspect, and eschatological focus of the title. However, while the student's response is thorough and insightful, they could have brought more focus to the core point that the title signifies Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
