  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" in its various theological, biblical, and eschatological dimensions. The writer provides rich examples from Scripture to support their arguments, demonstrating a strong understanding of Christian theology and biblical interpretation. The discussion is well-organized, and the writer's analysis is clear and concise.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be even more nuanced in its exploration of the title \"Son of Man.\" For instance, the writer could have delved deeper into the prophetic dimensions of Ezekiel and Daniel to further underscore Jesus' messianic identity. Additionally, a brief reflection on how this title relates to contemporary Christian life or witness would have strengthened the response's practical application.\n\nOverall, however, this is an outstanding response that provides a comprehensive understanding of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" and its implications for our faith."
