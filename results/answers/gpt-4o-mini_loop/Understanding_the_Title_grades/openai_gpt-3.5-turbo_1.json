It not only expands on the dual nature of Jesus but also delves into the Old Testament roots, messianic references, the concept of Jesus as a suffering servant, and the eschatological focus of the title. The elaborate explanation, rich in biblical references, demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian beliefs and contributes significantly to understanding the profound relationship between Jesus and humanity within the Christian faith."
