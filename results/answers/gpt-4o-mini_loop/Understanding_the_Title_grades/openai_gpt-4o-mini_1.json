  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-explained analysis of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" and effectively addresses the concern by discussing the theological, biblical, and historical implications of this title within the Christian faith. The integration of Old Testament roots, messianic references, the concept of the suffering servant, and eschatological themes enriches the understanding of Jesus' dual nature and his purpose in God's plan for redemption. The response demonstrates a deep grasp of Christian theology and effectively illustrates the profound connection between Jesus' identity and his relationship with humanity."
