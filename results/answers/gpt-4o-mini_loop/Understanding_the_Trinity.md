## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
The concept of God existing as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit while being one God is known as the doctrine of the Trinity, a foundational pillar of Christian theology. This doctrine can be understood through the following key points:

1. **Monotheism**: Christianity firmly upholds the belief in one God. The Trinity does not suggest multiple gods; rather, it teaches that the one God exists in three distinct persons.

2. **Distinct Persons**: Each of the three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—is fully and completely God, sharing the same divine essence. Yet, they remain distinct in their personhood; the Father is not the Son, and the Son is not the Holy Spirit. All three coexist in unity as one God.

3. **Biblical Foundation**: The Scriptures provide the basis for the doctrine of the Trinity. Notable references include:
   - **Matthew 28:19**, which commands believers to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
   - **John 1:1**, which proclaims that the Word (who is Jesus) was with God and was God.
   - **2 Corinthians 13:14**, where all three persons are mentioned in the context of blessings.

4. **Economic and Immanent Trinity**: The distinction between the economic Trinity and the immanent Trinity helps us understand God’s interaction with creation versus His internal relationship among the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person has specific roles: the Father as creator, the Son as redeemer, and the Holy Spirit as sustainer and comforter.

5. **Mystery of the Trinity**: Ultimately, the Trinity remains a profound mystery that surpasses human comprehension. While it is a complex theological concept, Christians embrace it through faith based on the revelation found in Scripture and the historical teachings of the Church.

In conclusion, the Trinity encapsulates a rich understanding of God’s nature, emphasizing the oneness of God while recognizing His tri-personal existence. This mystery is central to Christian faith and worship, inviting believers into a deeper relationship with the one true God.
