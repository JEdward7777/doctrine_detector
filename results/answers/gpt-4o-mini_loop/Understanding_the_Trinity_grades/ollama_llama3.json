  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'm grading based on a Christian-specific worldview!\n\nGrade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise overview of the doctrine of the Trinity, highlighting its foundation in Scripture and its implications for understanding God's nature. The writer effectively addresses the concern by acknowledging the complexity of the issue while emphasizing the biblical basis for this mystery. While the response could be strengthened with more depth and nuance in certain areas (e.g., the distinction between economic and immanent Trinity), it provides a solid foundation for understanding the Trinity.\n\nThe answer being graded is incomplete, but it does touch on the fundamental idea that each person of the Trinity is fully God. However, this response goes beyond the simple statement by providing a more comprehensive explanation of the doctrine."
