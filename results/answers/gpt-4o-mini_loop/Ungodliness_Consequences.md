In the Bible, God's pronouncement of consequences on ungodly people is expressed through various passages across both the Old and New Testaments. Here are some key themes and verses that illustrate these consequences:

1. **Separation from God**: One of the primary consequences of ungodliness is spiritual separation from God. Isaiah 59:2 states, "But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear."

2. **Judgment**: The Bible frequently speaks of God's judgment against the ungodly. In 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, it says, "In flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might."

3. **Death and Destruction**: Proverbs 11:21 expresses the idea that the wicked will not go unpunished: "Be assured, an evil person will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered." Romans 6:23 reinforces this notion, stating, "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."

4. **Final Judgment**: Revelation 20:11-15 describes the final judgment, where those whose names are not found in the Book of Life will face eternal punishment. This reflects the ultimate consequence for unrepentant sin.

5. **Corruption of Character**: Ungodliness can also lead to a corrupt moral state. Romans 1:24-28 discusses how God gives people over to their sinful desires as a form of judgment, resulting in actions that are contrary to His will.

6. **Temporal Consequences**: There are also immediate, temporal consequences for ungodly behavior mentioned throughout Scripture, such as the breakdown of community, personal suffering, and societal ramifications. Galatians 6:7 warns, "Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap."

Overall, the theme throughout the Bible is that ungodliness leads to separation from God, judgment, and ultimately destruction, while urging repentance and the pursuit of righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ for redemption and eternal life. In God's love and mercy, He calls all to turn away from sin and seek Him wholeheartedly.
