  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-detailed answer outlining the consequences of ungodliness according to various passages in the Bible. However, the answer did not explicitly emphasize the aspect of God's judgment and wrath on ungodly individuals who reject Him, which was the specific concern raised in the teacher's reference answer. Encouraging the student to further highlight this aspect in their response would align it more closely with the Christian-specific worldview focused on God's judgment and wrath towards ungodly individuals."
