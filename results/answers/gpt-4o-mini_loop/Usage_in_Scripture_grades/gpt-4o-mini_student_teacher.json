  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting various contexts and implications. They effectively connect the term to God's holiness, prophetic references, messianic foreshadowing, and the divine nature of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of how the term is used throughout Scripture, underscoring the authority and divinity of Jesus. However, the response could have been improved by directly stating that in the New Testament, \"Holy One\" specifically refers to Jesus, aligning more closely with the teacher's answer."
