The answer effectively addresses the concern by specifically discussing how the term 'Holy One' in the New Testament refers to Jesus, affirming His divine nature. The connection between the authority and divinity of Jesus is well-explained through biblical references and explanations. Great job presenting a thorough Christian worldview perspective on this topic."
