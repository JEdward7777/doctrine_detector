4. **God's Judgment and Salvation**: The usage signifies God’s authority in both judgment and redemption.
   - **Habakkuk 1:12**: The prophet addresses God as "Holy One," affirming that His actions are just and righteous.

### New Testament Contexts:

1. **Jesus Christ**: In the New Testament, "Holy One" is often used to describe Jesus, affirming His divine nature:
   - **Luke 1:35**: The angel tells Mary that "the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God."
   - **Acts 3:14**: Peter refers to Jesus as "the Holy One and the Just" while addressing the crowds regarding the crucifixion.

2. **Believers' Calling**: The New Testament also employs the term to describe those who are set apart for God:
   - **1 Peter 1:15-16**: Believers are called to be holy as God is holy, reflecting their identity as a royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9).

3. **Divine Worship**: The term enhances discussions of worship and reminds believers of the reverence due to God:
   - **Revelation 4:8**: The beings around the throne proclaim: “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,” emphasizing God's eternal holiness.

### Summary:
The term "Holy One" underscores God’s nature and character, the uniqueness of Jesus as the Messiah, and the calling of believers to manifest God's holiness in their lives. It appears in contexts of worship, prophecy, and teaching about holiness, contributing to the overarching theme of divine sanctity throughout the biblical narrative.
