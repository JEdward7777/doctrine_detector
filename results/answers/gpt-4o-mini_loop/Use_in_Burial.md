## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In biblical times, myrrh was used in burial practices primarily for its aromatic properties and its ability to help mask the odor of decay. It is a resin obtained from the Commiphora myrrha tree and has been valued since ancient times for its fragrance and medicinal properties.

In the context of burial, myrrh was one of the spices brought by the Magi (Wise Men) as a gift for the infant Jesus, indicating its significance and value (Matthew 2:11). More directly related to burial, myrrh was one of the substances used in the preparation of Jesus' body after His crucifixion. According to John 19:39-40, Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds, to anoint Jesus' body before placing it in the tomb. This practice aligns with Jewish customs of the time, where spices and oils were used to wrap the body of the deceased, both as a sign of respect and to combat the smell of death.

Furthermore, myrrh is mentioned in the Old Testament as an ingredient in the holy anointing oil (Exodus 30:23-25), demonstrating its significance in both sacred and secular rites. This dual usage underscores its value not only in the context of burial but also in spiritual practices.

Overall, myrrh's role in burial practices during biblical times highlights its importance in honoring the dead and adhering to cultural and religious customs, reinforcing its significance throughout biblical narratives and traditions.
