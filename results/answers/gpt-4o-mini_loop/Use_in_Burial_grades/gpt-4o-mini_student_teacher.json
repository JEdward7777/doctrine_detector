  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer that gives significant insight into the use of myrrh in biblical times, particularly in burial practices. They correctly referenced relevant biblical passages and connected myrrh to both sacred and secular rites. The response effectively demonstrates the cultural and religious significance of myrrh in honoring the dead. However, the response could have been more concise and focused directly on the use of myrrh in burial practices without veering into other topics."
