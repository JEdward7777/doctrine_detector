## [Answer](../Use_of__Rabbi_.md) by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
In the New Testament, the term "Rabbi" is primarily used to refer to Jesus. The title means "teacher" in Hebrew and signifies someone recognized as an authority in Jewish law and theology.

1. **John the Baptist:** John the Baptist is often seen as a prophetic figure and a forerunner to Jesus, but he is not explicitly referred to as "Rabbi" in the Gospels. His ministry focused on baptizing and proclaiming the coming of the Messiah. John played the vital role of calling people to repentance and preparing the way for Jesus rather than serving as a teacher in the rabbinic tradition.

2. **Jesus:** In contrast, Jesus is frequently addressed as "Rabbi" by His followers and others throughout the Gospels. For instance, in John 1:38, two of John the Baptist's disciples refer to Jesus as "Rabbi" when they begin to follow Him. This title reflects His role as a teacher and His authoritative position in interpreting the Scriptures, underlining His significance in the religious landscape of His time.

In summary, John the Baptist is not commonly called "Rabbi," while Jesus is recognized with this title, highlighting His role as the ultimate teacher and leader within the Jewish context of His ministry.
