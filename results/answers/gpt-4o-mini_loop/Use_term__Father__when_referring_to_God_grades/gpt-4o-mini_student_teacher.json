  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of the term \"Father\" in Christian theology and the importance of maintaining doctrinal integrity. The student appropriately considers the need for sensitivity to context and offers practical solutions for addressing potential misunderstandings. However, while the student acknowledges the necessity of using the term \"Father\" with proper teaching and context, they also suggest alternative descriptors when needed, which could potentially dilute the scriptural message. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful response."
