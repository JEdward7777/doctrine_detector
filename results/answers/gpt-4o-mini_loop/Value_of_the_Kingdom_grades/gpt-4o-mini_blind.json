  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a deep understanding of the parables Jesus used to describe the value of the Kingdom of God. The explanation of each parable is clear and insightful, showcasing the spiritual and theological significance of each story. The student effectively connects each parable to its broader lesson about the Kingdom of God and the believer's response to it. The inclusion of relevant Bible references adds depth to the analysis. The only improvement could be a more explicit connection to the foundational truth that the Kingdom of God is at hand through Jesus Christ."
