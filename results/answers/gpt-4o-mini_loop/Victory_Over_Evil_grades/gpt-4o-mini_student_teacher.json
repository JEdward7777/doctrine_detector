The student effectively connects both Revelation 20:10 and Genesis 3:15 to demonstrate the continuity of this promise throughout the Bible. This well-supported response aligns perfectly with the Christian worldview, showcasing an understanding of God's sovereignty and the certainty of triumph over evil. Well done!"
