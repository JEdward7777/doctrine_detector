  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and doctrinally sound explanation of the significance of Jesus' death on the cross regarding Satan's dominion. The student effectively ties in key biblical references and theological concepts such as substitutionary atonement, victory over sin and death, defeating Satan's power, restoration of God's original intent, establishment of God's Kingdom, and the hope of final judgment. The connection between Jesus as the second Adam bringing redemption and victory is well-articulated. Well done!"
