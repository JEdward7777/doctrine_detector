  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of practical ways for Christians to honor God in their daily lives, the focus was on actionable expressions of faith rather than directly addressing the core theme of thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and showcasing His greatness as outlined in the reference answer. The student's suggestions are undeniably valuable and aligned with Christian values, emphasizing prayer, love, integrity, stewardship, worship, witnessing, forgiveness, holiness, gratitude, and service, among others. However, the concern of showcasing God's greatness could have been more explicitly integrated throughout the response to fully align with the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of practical expressions of faith but could have more directly emphasized the central aspect of praising and obeying God."
