  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90/100.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained response to the question, going beyond just stating that the term \"Word of God\" encompasses the scriptures and the person of Jesus Christ. They have delved into various dimensions of the term, including its theological significance, God's communicative actions, and the spiritual authority associated with it. The student effectively integrates biblical references to support their points, showing a deep understanding of the topic. Additionally, their answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, demonstrating a solid grasp of the subject matter.\n\nThe only slight area for improvement would be to ensure that the response explicitly addresses the concern of understanding the scope and significance of God's communication to humanity right at the beginning of the answer. Apart from that, the student has provided a strong and insightful analysis of the term \"Word of God\" according to the Bible."
