  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The response provides a clear and comprehensive list of modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God. The examples given are relevant and well-explained. The answer is structured and addresses the question effectively. One area for improvement could be to include more Scriptural references or theological insights to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective. Overall, a solid response."
