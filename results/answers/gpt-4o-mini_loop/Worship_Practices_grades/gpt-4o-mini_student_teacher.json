  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of modern idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God, demonstrating a good understanding of the concern raised. The examples given are relevant and well-explained. The student's answer appropriately emphasizes the importance of examining one's heart and priorities to ensure devotion to God. A minor improvement could be to focus more on the prioritization aspect mentioned in the reference answer."
