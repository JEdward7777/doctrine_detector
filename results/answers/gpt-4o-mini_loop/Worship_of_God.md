## Answer given by [gpt-4o-mini loop](../../answering_models/gpt-4o-mini_loop.md)
People are created to worship God because it fulfills their designed purpose: to glorify Him and enjoy a personal relationship with their Creator. This truth is underscored in Isaiah 43:7, which states that God created individuals for His glory. Worshiping God not only recognizes His sovereignty and goodness but also deepens the believer's connection with Him, aligning them with their fundamental purpose in life.

The Bible provides numerous warnings about the dangers of false gods and idolatry, which is the act of worshiping anything other than the one true God. In the Ten Commandments, God explicitly instructs His followers not to have any other gods before Him (Exodus 20:3-6). Idolatry is not merely a violation of this commandment; it represents a rejection of God's rightful authority and can lead to significant moral and spiritual consequences. 

The impact of idolatry can be profound, as it often diverts attention and devotion away from God, leading individuals to become enslaved by their desires and distractions. This disconnection from God can result in a decline in spiritual life, leaving those who worship false gods feeling unfulfilled and empty. The Bible illustrates the futility of such practices, as seen in Psalm 115:4-8, where the psalmist contrasts the living God with powerless idols that cannot see, hear, or respond. 

Ultimately, humans are intended to worship the true God, and Scripture warns against the dangers of idolatry, urging believers to prioritize their relationship with Him above all else. By keeping God at the center of their lives, believers can experience true fulfillment and purpose.
