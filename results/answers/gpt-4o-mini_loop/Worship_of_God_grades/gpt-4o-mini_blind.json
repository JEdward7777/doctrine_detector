  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of why people are created to worship God and includes relevant Bible verses to support the points made. The student effectively highlights the importance of worshiping the one true God and the consequences of idolatry. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the grace and love of God in inviting humans into a relationship with Him despite their fallen nature."
