  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern about avoiding idolatry by emphasizing the importance of worshiping the true God. It correctly identifies false gods as nonliving idols that people mistakenly worship, and it highlights the dangers of diverting attention and devotion away from God. The reference to Psalm 115:4-8 is also a strong point, as it illustrates the futility of idolatry.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. For example, the explanation of why people were created to worship God (i.e., \"as indicated in the Bible\") is somewhat vague and could be more detailed. Additionally, while the response mentions the importance of keeping God at the center of one's life, it could provide more specific guidance on how to avoid idolatry and prioritize one's relationship with God.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern about avoiding idolatry. With some additional detail and guidance, it could be even stronger."
