The inclusion of the importance of recognizing the seriousness of defiling God's sacred spaces aligns well with the concern provided. The response could be strengthened by emphasizing the need for Christians to heed prophetic warnings and take appropriate action in response to such signs of rebellion against God. Overall, a solid understanding and application of Christian beliefs on this topic."
