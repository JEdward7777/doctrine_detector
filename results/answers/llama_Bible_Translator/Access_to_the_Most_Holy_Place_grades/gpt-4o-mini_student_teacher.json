  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of the restriction on entering the most holy place. They effectively connected the Old Testament practices to Christian teachings, highlighting the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest who bridges the gap between God and humanity. The response also effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him. However, the answer could have been improved by directly referencing the importance of maintaining the holiness of God's presence, similar to the reference answer given by the teacher."
