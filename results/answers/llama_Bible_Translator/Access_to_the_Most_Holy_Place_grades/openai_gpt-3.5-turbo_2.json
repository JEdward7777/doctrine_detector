It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of recognizing God's holiness and the necessary protocols for approaching Him. The connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest who transcended the restrictions through His sacrifice is well articulated. Overall, a strong and well-supported response."
