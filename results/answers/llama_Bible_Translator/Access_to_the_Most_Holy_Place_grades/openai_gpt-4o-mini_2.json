The connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest and mediator in the New Testament era solidifies the Christian perspective on the topic. The only slight improvement could be a more explicit mention of the need for a sinless intercessor to bridge the gap between God and humanity, aligning even more closely with Christian theology."
