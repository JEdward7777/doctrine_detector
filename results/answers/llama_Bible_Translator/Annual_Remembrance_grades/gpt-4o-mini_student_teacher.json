  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer with a score of 90.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough explanation of the significance of the Passover celebration for the Israelites based on biblical references. They have accurately highlighted the reasons for observing Passover, including remembrance of God's deliverance, covenant with the Israelites, redemption through faith, and the joy of celebration. The student's response is well-reasoned and aligns with Christian beliefs regarding the importance of remembrance in the faith.\n\nThe slight deduction in points is due to the student's elaboration beyond the core focus of the question, which could potentially distract from the central theme. Nonetheless, their understanding and articulation of the theological implications of the Passover celebration are commendable."
