## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Bible, specifically in Exodus 12:14-20 and Deuteronomy 16:1-8, the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover (also known as Pesach) every year for several reasons.

Firstly, God instructed them to observe this festival as a reminder of His miraculous deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The Passover commemorates the night when the angel of death passed over the homes of the Israelites, sparing their firstborn sons while killing the firstborn sons of the Egyptians (Exodus 12:21-23). This event was a direct act of God's power and a demonstration of His sovereignty.

Secondly, the Passover was to be an annual reminder of the covenant God made with the Israelites. By observing this festival, the Israelites would remember their commitment to follow God's laws and commands, which were given at Mount Sinai (Exodus 12:24-27). This reminder would help them stay faithful to God and avoid falling into idolatry or other forms of disobedience.

Thirdly, the Passover was a celebration of redemption. The Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt was a physical type of redemption, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption that would come through Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 5:7-8). By observing the Passover, the Israelites would be reminded of their need for spiritual redemption and the promise of salvation through faith in God.

Lastly, the Passover was to be a time of joy and celebration. The Israelites were instructed to eat unleavened bread and bitter herbs during the festival, which symbolized their hasty departure from Egypt (Exodus 12:15). This somber tone would remind them of their past bondage and God's deliverance.

In summary, the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year as a reminder of God's miraculous deliverance, His covenant with them, redemption through faith, and the joy of celebration.
