It effectively connects the practice of Passover to key Christian principles of remembrance, covenant, redemption, and joy, demonstrating a solid understanding of the importance of remembrance in Christian faith. The only minor improvement could be further incorporation of New Testament references connecting the Passover to the fulfillment in Jesus Christ for a more comprehensive Christian worldview perspective."
