## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In biblical Christianity, receiving the Holy Spirit refers to the experience of being filled or empowered by God's Spirit for service and witness. The concept is rooted in Jesus' promise to send a "Helper" (John 14:26) after his ascension.

Anointing with the Holy Spirit typically involves a spiritual experience where believers are empowered, enlightened, and equipped for specific purposes. This anointing can be seen in various contexts:

1. **Initial Salvation**: When people respond to God's invitation by faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:5-7), they receive the Holy Spirit as a seal of their salvation (Ephesians 1:13). This initial anointing is a guarantee of their inheritance and a means of communion with God.
2. **Ordination for Ministry**: In the New Testament, some individuals received a special anointing by the Holy Spirit to embark on a specific ministry or task (e.g., prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, apostles like Peter and Paul). This anointing often accompanied a commission or assignment from God (Luke 4:18; Acts 13:2).
3. **Empowerment for Service**: Believers can also receive the Holy Spirit's anointing for specific purposes, such as preaching (Acts 2:4-5), healing (Mark 16:17-20), or evangelism (Acts 1:8). This anointing often accompanies a prayerful preparation and a clear understanding of God's will.
4. **Renewal and Revival**: Throughout church history, believers have experienced the Holy Spirit's anointing for renewal and revival. This can manifest in powerful spiritual awakenings, where people are filled with joy, peace, and a deepened sense of worship (Acts 2:17-21).

In each context, receiving the Holy Spirit's anointing involves:

* A deepening awareness of God's presence and guidance
* Increased power or empowerment for service or witness
* A renewed commitment to follow Jesus Christ
* A stronger sense of unity with other believers and with God

As Christian translators, we must emphasize that this anointing is not a one-time event but rather a continuous process, where believers can experience the Holy Spirit's empowering presence throughout their lives.
