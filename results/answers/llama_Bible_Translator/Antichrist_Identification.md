## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In 1 John 2:18-22 and 4:1-6, the Apostle John writes about antichrists and those who are considered antichrists. According to his writings, an antichrist is not a single individual, but rather a type of person or group that denies Jesus Christ.

John identifies several characteristics that define someone as an antichrist:

1. Denying Jesus Christ: Antichrists deny Jesus Christ, either explicitly or implicitly (1 John 2:22). This denial can take many forms, including rejecting the divinity of Jesus, ignoring His teachings, or denying His work on the cross.
2. Not loving brothers and sisters in Christ: Antichrists do not have love for their fellow believers (1 John 3:18). They may claim to be Christians but show no genuine affection or concern for other Christians.
3. Having only a partial message of the gospel: Some antichrists may have a partial understanding of God's Word, but they reject its fullness and depth (1 John 4:2-6).
4. Practicing evil and opposing good: Antichrists engage in sinful behavior, and their actions are opposed to God's will and character (1 John 3:8).

In summary, an antichrist is someone who denies Jesus Christ, lacks love for fellow believers, has a partial understanding of the gospel, and practices evil.
