## Question [Antichrist Identification](../../../questions/Antichrist_Identification.md)
According to the apostle John, what defines a person as an antichrist?

## Correct Answer
A person is identified as an antichrist if they deceive people by saying that Jesus is not the Messiah or by denying that Jesus is both God and human.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the traits of antichrists helps Christians recognize and resist false teachings.

## [Answer](../Antichrist_Identification.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In 1 John 2:18-22 and 4:1-6, the Apostle John writes about antichrists and those who are considered antichrists. According to his writings, an antichrist is not a single individual, but rather a type of person or group that denies Jesus Christ.

John identifies several characteristics that define someone as an antichrist:

1. Denying Jesus Christ: Antichrists deny Jesus Christ, either explicitly or implicitly (1 John 2:22). This denial can take many forms, including rejecting the divinity of Jesus, ignoring His teachings, or denying His work on the cross.
2. Not loving brothers and sisters in Christ: Antichrists do not have love for their fellow believers (1 John 3:18). They may claim to be Christians but show no genuine affection or concern for other Christians.
3. Having only a partial message of the gospel: Some antichrists may have a partial understanding of God's Word, but they reject its fullness and depth (1 John 4:2-6).
4. Practicing evil and opposing good: Antichrists engage in sinful behavior, and their actions are opposed to God's will and character (1 John 3:8).

In summary, an antichrist is someone who denies Jesus Christ, lacks love for fellow believers, has a partial understanding of the gospel, and practices evil.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this response as a 90. The student provides a detailed and accurate explanation of what defines a person as an antichrist according to the writings of the apostle John in 1 John 2:18-22 and 4:1-6. They correctly identify and elaborate on the key characteristics, such as denying Jesus Christ, lack of love for fellow believers, partial understanding of the gospel, and engagement in sinful behavior. The response is well-structured and covers the essential points effectively. A minor improvement could be adding a bit more emphasis on the spiritual aspect of being an antichrist, aligning with Christian doctrine that emphasizes spiritual warfare and deception, but overall, this is a solid answer.
