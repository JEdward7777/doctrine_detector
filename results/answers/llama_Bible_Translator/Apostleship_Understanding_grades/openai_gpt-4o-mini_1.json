The answer effectively expands on the importance of authority, empowerment, continuity, unity, and accountability within the apostolic commission, highlighting key theological implications for the spread of Christianity. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references and the explanation of each point in connection to the Great Commission demonstrate a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective.
