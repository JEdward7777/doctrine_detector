The emphasis on forgiveness, active listening, addressing conflicts promptly, and modeling Jesus' example are particularly commendable. The only room for improvement would be to further stress the centrality of Christ's sacrifice in enabling reconciliation and to deepen the theological underpinnings of reconciliation in Christ."
