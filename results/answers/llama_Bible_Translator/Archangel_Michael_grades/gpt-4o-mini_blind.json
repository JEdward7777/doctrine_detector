  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 100. The answer is doctrinally correct and provides scriptural references to support the claim that Michael is the only angel referred to as an \"archangel\" in the Bible. The student also correctly explains the significance of this title in emphasizing Michael's high rank and authority among the heavenly hosts. Well done!"
