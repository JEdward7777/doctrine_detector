According to Exodus 25:22 and Hebrews 9:3-4, the Ark of the Covenant was placed inside the Holy of Holies (also known as the Most Holy Place) within the Tabernacle. The Tabernacle was a portable place of worship that the Israelites carried with them during their wilderness wanderings.

The Tabernacle had three main sections:

1. The Outer Court: This was the area where the priests would minister to the people, offer sacrifices, and teach the Torah.
2. The Holy Place: This was the second section, where the priests would burn incense, light the lamps, and perform their daily rituals.
3. The Holy of Holies (or Most Holy Place): This was a separate compartment, separated from the Holy Place by a curtain, where only the High Priest could enter once a year on Yom Kippur to make atonement for the sins of Israel.

The Ark of the Covenant was placed in the center of the Holy of Holies, surrounded by the Cherubim (winged creatures that symbolized God's presence). The Ark contained three main items:

1. The Tablets of the Law: These were the original Ten Commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai.
2. Aaron's Rod: This was the staff that had budded as a sign of God's approval of Aaron, the first High Priest.
3. The Pot of Manna: This represented God's provision and care for His people during their wilderness wanderings.

The Ark was not only a symbol of God's presence but also a reminder of His covenant with Israel. Its placement in the Holy of Holies emphasized its importance as a sacred object that contained the very words and presence of God.
