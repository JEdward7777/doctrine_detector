It correctly identifies the various sacred objects within the Ark and their symbolic meanings in relation to God's presence, salvation, and judgment. The connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the Ark's symbolism is well articulated. The student could enhance the answer by referencing specific Old Testament passages when discussing the Ark's role as an instrument of judgment and by delving deeper into the typological connections between the Ark and Jesus Christ. Overall, a solid analysis with strong doctrinal insights."
