  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of how atonement, forgiveness, and reconciliation are interconnected in Christianity. The student effectively explains the biblical basis for these concepts and their relationship to each other. However, there are some areas where the explanation could be further expanded or clarified to deepen the theological understanding. Additionally, some key Scriptural references could have been integrated more prominently to strengthen the argument. Overall, a well-written response that demonstrates a good grasp of the topic."
