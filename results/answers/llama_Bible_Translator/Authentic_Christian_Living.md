What a great question!

In Romans 12:9, the apostle Paul writes, "Let love be your greatest effort, and do not be lazy in showing devotion." (HCSB)

To avoid hypocrisy, our love and actions should be characterized by authenticity, sincerity, and self-sacrifice. Here are some key takeaways from this verse:

1. **Make a conscious effort to show love**: "Let love be your greatest effort" implies that we need to intentionally prioritize showing love to others. This isn't just about feeling love, but about actively demonstrating it in our words and deeds.
2. **Avoid laziness and apathy**: The Greek word for "lazy" (ἀσθένεια) carries connotations of being weak or feeble. By contrast, we're called to be strong and vigorous in our devotion to others. Apathy and indifference are the opposite of love; they reveal a lack of care and concern.
3. **Show devotion**: The word "devotion" (ἐπιδεήσῃ) means to be fully committed or dedicated. This implies a willingness to go beyond mere lip service and truly invest in relationships, serving others, and displaying Christ-like love.

To avoid hypocrisy, we should strive for:

* Sincere intentions: Our love and actions should stem from a genuine desire to honor God and serve others, rather than seeking personal gain or recognition.
* Consistency: Let our words and deeds be aligned with our profession of faith. If we claim to love others, let our actions demonstrate that love consistently.
* Self-sacrifice: Be willing to put the needs of others before our own desires and interests. This is a hallmark of true Christian love (John 15:13).

By embracing these characteristics, we can avoid hypocrisy and demonstrate genuine love and devotion to God and those around us.
