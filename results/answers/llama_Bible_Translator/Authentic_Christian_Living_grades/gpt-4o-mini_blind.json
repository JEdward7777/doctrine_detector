  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and thoughtful analysis of Romans 12:9, focusing on key aspects such as making a conscious effort to show love, avoiding laziness and apathy, and emphasizing sincere intentions, consistency, and self-sacrifice. The explanation is well-supported with relevant references and applications. One suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the role of relying on God's grace and empowerment to truly live out these characteristics of love, as human effort alone may fall short. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response. Great job!"
