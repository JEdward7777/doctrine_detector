  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of Romans 12:9 and highlighted important aspects such as making a conscious effort to show love, avoiding laziness, and showing devotion. However, the student could have focused more on the core aspect of avoiding hypocrisy by emphasizing genuine and sincere love, as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding but could have connected the ideas more directly to the concern of living out faith authentically."
