  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 92.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern about living out our faith authentically, highlighting the importance of sincerity and self-sacrifice in demonstrating love to others. The explanation of the Greek words and their connotations adds depth and nuance to the interpretation of Romans 12:9.\n\nThe response also provides practical takeaways for avoiding hypocrisy, including having sincere intentions, being consistent in one's actions and words, and putting the needs of others before one's own desires.\n\nOne area where the response could improve is by more explicitly linking the ideas presented back to the concern about being effective representatives of Christ's love. While the response does touch on this theme, it could be further developed with examples or applications of how living out faith authentically can lead to greater effectiveness in sharing God's love with others.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong and thoughtful response that effectively addresses the given answer and concern."
