  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of divine authority in the Christian faith, outlining its significance and implications for believers. The answer effectively connects divine authority to the concept of inspiration in the Bible and elaborates on its importance in various aspects of a believer's life. The response is well-structured, coherent, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. However, the student may have slightly deviated from the exact wording of the reference answer by emphasizing additional aspects of divine authority beyond moral and spiritual guidance. Overall, a strong and insightful analysis with a slight deviation from the reference answer."
