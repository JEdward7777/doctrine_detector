It effectively addresses the concern by connecting divine authority to believers' ability to discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. The response is well-structured, supported by Biblical references, and highlights the implications of divine authority in a believer's life. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to potentially provide more discussion on how believers can practically apply divine authority in their daily decision-making processes. Overall, this is an excellent and thorough response."
