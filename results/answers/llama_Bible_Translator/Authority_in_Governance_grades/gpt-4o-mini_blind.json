  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the Biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers over their citizens. The references to Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:13-17 are relevant and well-explained. The student effectively emphasizes the accountability of governing rulers to God and the importance of submitting to authority in accordance with God's will. Great doctrinal correctness is demonstrated, but could have been improved by addressing potential exceptions or limitations to submission to governing authorities, such as instances where rulers may go against God's commands."
