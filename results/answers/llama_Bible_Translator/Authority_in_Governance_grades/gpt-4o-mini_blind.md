## [Answer](../Authority_in_Governance.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that governing rulers have been appointed by God and are accountable to Him for their actions (Romans 13:1-7, Titus 3:1). The passage in Romans 13:1-7 specifically states:

"Everyone must submit himself to the higher powers, because there is no authority except from God, and those which exist have been put in place by God. Therefore whoever resists the authority, he opposes the ordinance of God; and they who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be free from fear of the one's in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. For this is the reason you also pay taxes, because authorities are God's servants, busy about this very thing. Render to all their due: taxes to Caesar and render to God things that are God's."

This passage emphasizes that governing rulers have been appointed by God and are accountable to Him for their actions. It teaches that citizens should submit themselves to the higher powers and obey the laws and regulations established by those in authority, as long as they do not contradict God's will.

Additionally, 1 Peter 2:13-17 states:

"Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the king as supreme or to governors as sent by him. For this is the will of God, your sanctification that you keep on seeking spiritual fervor in the hope that the called may lay hold on eternal life. For this purpose the chief Shepherd was made manifest, so that He might die for the sins of all the nations. And when they have heard and known the ways which are pleasing before Him, though they be a stubborn generation, they will turn back to Him with prayer; then as they do good and cease from evil, God will bless them."

These passages teach that governing rulers have been appointed by God and are accountable to Him for their actions. They also emphasize the importance of submitting oneself to the higher powers and obeying the laws and regulations established by those in authority, as long as they do not contradict God's will.

In conclusion, the Bible teaches that governing rulers have been appointed by God and are accountable to Him for their actions. It emphasizes the importance of submitting oneself to the higher powers and obeying the laws and regulations established by those in authority, as long as they do not contradict God's will.

Grade: 90

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the Biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers over their citizens. The references to Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:13-17 are relevant and well-explained. The student effectively emphasizes the accountability of governing rulers to God and the importance of submitting to authority in accordance with God's will. Great doctrinal correctness is demonstrated, but could have been improved by addressing potential exceptions or limitations to submission to governing authorities, such as instances where rulers may go against God's commands.
