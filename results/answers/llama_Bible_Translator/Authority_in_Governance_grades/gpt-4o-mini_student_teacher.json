  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with relevant biblical references that affirm the authority of governing rulers as established by God and the importance of citizens obeying those in authority. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern, rather than repeating similar points multiple times. Overall, a solid understanding of the God-ordained structure of authority is demonstrated."
