The inclusion of both Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:13-17, along with the emphasis on submitting to authority, aligns well with the concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. The response effectively highlights the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty in the establishment of governing authorities. Great job incorporating key biblical passages and principles into the analysis!"
