  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation about the relationship between the authority of the apostles, their ability to perform miracles, and preach boldly with a strong emphasis on divine empowerment and authorization. The student made solid connections to relevant scriptures and effectively demonstrated an understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The answer was well-structured, coherent, and supported by biblical references. However, the answer could have been improved by more directly addressing the concern by succinctly summarizing the key points related to divine empowerment and authority."
