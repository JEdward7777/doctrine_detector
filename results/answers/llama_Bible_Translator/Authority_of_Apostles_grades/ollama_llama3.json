  "grade": 92.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 92.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the concern of divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, providing clear biblical examples to support its claims. The author effectively demonstrates how the apostles' ability to perform miracles and preach boldly was rooted in their recognition of God's power and presence among them. The use of specific scripture references and narratives (e.g., Matthew 28:18-20, Acts 2:43; 4:33; 5:12) adds credibility and depth to the argument.\n\nThe response also does an excellent job of highlighting the interconnectedness of the apostles' words and deeds, showing how their miracles and preaching were not separate but complementary aspects of their ministry. The author's emphasis on the divine authorization behind the apostles' authority is particularly strong, as they recognize that the apostles saw themselves as instruments of God's will rather than relying solely on human abilities or charisma.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more specific examples of how this concept applies today, perhaps exploring how believers can tap into this same divine empowerment in their own ministries. However, overall, this response is well-organized, thoroughly supported by Scripture, and effectively communicates the concern of divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles."
