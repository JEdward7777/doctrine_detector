## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In the New Testament, the apostles' authority is closely tied to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. In fact, it's often hard to separate the two.

Let's start with Jesus' commissioning of his disciples in Matthew 28:18-20, where he gives them authority over all nations and tells them to teach and baptize people in his name. This authority is not just a moral or ethical mandate but a divine authorization, rooted in Christ's own power and presence.

As the apostles went out to spread the good news of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, they found that their words were accompanied by signs and wonders (Acts 2:43; 4:33; 5:12). The miracles they performed were not just a means to gain people's attention but also a demonstration of God's power and validation of their message.

In other words, the apostles' authority was not just about what they said but also about what they did. Their miracles and preaching went hand in hand, with each reinforcing the other. The apostles were not simply charismatic speakers; they were also empowered by the Holy Spirit to perform extraordinary works that testified to the truth of their message.

This is why we see so many accounts of miracles and healings in the early Christian communities described in the New Testament (e.g., Acts 3:1-10, 9:32-43; 2 Corinthians 12:12). These signs and wonders were not just a way to persuade people but also a means to demonstrate God's power and presence among his people.

Furthermore, the apostles' authority was not limited to their own abilities or personal charisma. They recognized that they were instruments of God's will, carrying out a divine commission to spread the gospel (Romans 1:16; Ephesians 3:7-11). Their words and deeds were not their own but were empowered by the Holy Spirit, who was guiding them into all truth (John 16:13).

In summary, the apostles' authority is closely tied to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. Their words and deeds were not just a product of human ingenuity or charisma but were rooted in God's power and presence, which was demonstrated through signs and wonders. This divine authorization gave them the confidence to proclaim the gospel with boldness and to know that their message was validated by the miraculous works that accompanied it.
