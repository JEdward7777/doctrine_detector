  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response thoroughly explores the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry by referencing relevant biblical passages and providing a coherent explanation. It effectively connects the apostles' ability to perform miracles with their preaching as evidence of their God-given authority. The discussion is well-structured and provides a solid Christian worldview perspective on the topic. Great job!"
