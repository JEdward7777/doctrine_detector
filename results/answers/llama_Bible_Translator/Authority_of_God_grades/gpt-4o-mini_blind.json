  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the term \"Yahweh of Hosts\" in emphasizing God's authority over spiritual beings. The student effectively articulates key aspects of God's character and sovereignty, drawing insights from various Old Testament passages and connecting them to Christian theology. The response could be further enhanced by integrating more Scriptural references to support the points made and reinforcing the doctrinal implications of God's authority in greater depth. Overall, a solid and well-reasoned explanation."
