  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-developed explanation of the term \"Yahweh of Hosts,\" showcasing a deep understanding of God's authority over spiritual beings. They effectively linked the significance of the title to God's attributes of omniscience, omnipotence, authority, and justice. The student also connected this understanding to implications for human salvation. However, deducting a few points for adding some unnecessary details and not directly addressing the concern of how understanding God's authority can deepen faith and trust in His omnipotence. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a solid grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview."
