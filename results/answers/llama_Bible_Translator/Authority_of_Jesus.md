What a powerful and rich title!

The title "King of the Jews" (John 18:39; Matthew 2:2) not only reveals Jesus' authority over Israel, but also his sovereignty over all creation. Here are some ways this title illustrates Jesus' authority:

1. **Royal lineage**: As the Messiah, Jesus is a descendant of King David, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies (Jeremiah 23:5; Zechariah 9:10). This royal lineage establishes His authority to rule as King.
2. **Universal scope**: The phrase "King of the Jews" implies that Jesus' kingship is not limited to Israel alone but extends to all nations and peoples. Jesus Himself says, "My kingdom is from another realm‚Äù (John 18:36), indicating a universal domain.
3. **Divine authority**: As the Son of God, Jesus shares divine authority with His Father. In John 5:26-27, Jesus claims that as the Son, He has been given all authority by God and gives life to whom He wills. This divine authority underscores Jesus' kingship over all creation.
4. **Redemption and salvation**: As King of the Jews, Jesus is the one who brings redemption and salvation to His people (John 1:12; 14:6). This redemptive work extends beyond Israel to include Gentiles as well (Matthew 8:5-13; Acts 10:34-35).
5. **Supernatural power**: The title "King of the Jews" is often accompanied by references to Jesus' supernatural powers, such as miracles and healings (John 2:11; 4:54). These signs demonstrate His authority over nature, disease, and even death itself.
6. **Eschatological significance**: As King of the Jews, Jesus is seen as the one who will establish a new heavens and a new earth, ushering in a new era of peace, justice, and righteousness (Isaiah 2:1-5; Revelation 21:1-4). This eschatological dimension underscores His authority over all creation.

In summary, the title "King of the Jews" illustrates Jesus' authority over all creation by emphasizing His royal lineage, universal scope, divine authority, redemptive work, supernatural power, and eschatological significance.
