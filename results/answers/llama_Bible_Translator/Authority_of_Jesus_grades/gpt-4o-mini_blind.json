  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This answer provides a thorough and insightful exploration of how the title \"King of the Jews\" illustrates Jesus' authority over all creation. The student adeptly connects various scriptural references and theological concepts to support their points. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide even more direct scriptural references for each point to further solidify the doctrinal foundation of the answer. Overall, a strong and well-supported response."
