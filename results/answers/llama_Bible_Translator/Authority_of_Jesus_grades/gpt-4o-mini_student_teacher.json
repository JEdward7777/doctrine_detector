  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer that effectively demonstrates how the title \"King of the Jews\" illustrates Jesus' authority over all creation. They correctly highlighted key aspects such as Jesus' royal lineage, universal scope, divine authority, redemptive work, supernatural power, and eschatological significance. Overall, the student effectively addressed the concern of understanding Jesus' authority in acknowledging His sovereignty in believers' lives. Great job!"
