The inclusion of multiple relevant Scripture passages, along with explanations and interpretations, shows a strong grasp of the topic. However, there could have been more emphasis on the sovereignty of God in ordaining parental authority and the ultimate purpose of such authority being to raise children in God's ways. Additionally, a closer connection between the passages and the overarching theme of parental authority could have been made."
