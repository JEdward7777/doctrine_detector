## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
While we don't know all the details about every individual who contributed to the writing of the Psalms, biblical scholars generally agree that King David was the primary author of many psalms (around 73 out of 150). He is mentioned by name as the author of several psalms, including Psalm 2, 3, 7, 34, 51, and 110.

David's background as a shepherd, musician, and king of Israel influenced his writing style, which often expressed emotions, told stories, and conveyed spiritual insights. His experiences with God, such as his encounters in the wilderness (Psalm 23) and his victories over enemies (Psalm 44-46), are reflected throughout the Psalms.

Other key figures who may have contributed to the writing of the Psalms include:

1. Asaph: A Levite and leader of worship during David's reign, Asaph is credited with composing Psalm 50 and possibly others (Psalm 73).
2. The sons of Korah: This family of Levites was known for their musical talents and may have written some psalms, such as Psalm 42-49.
3. Moses: While not exclusively a Psalm writer, Moses is believed to have authored Psalm 90, which contains wisdom and poetic language characteristic of his writings in the Torah.
4. Solomon: As David's successor, Solomon might have written some psalms (e.g., Psalm 72), though this is less certain than David's authorship.

Please note that these attributions are based on biblical testimony, tradition, and linguistic analysis. The exact authors of all Psalms may remain unknown to us, but the divine inspiration behind them remains a cornerstone of Christian faith.
