  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: This student has provided a well-thought-out and balanced answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the complexities involved in translating the term \"Son of God\" for polytheistic cultures. They have appropriately highlighted the importance of maintaining theological accuracy while also considering cultural sensitivity. The student's suggestions on contextualization, clarification, alternative translations, consultation with local experts, and theological accuracy are all sound and align well with Christian principles. The only room for improvement would be to perhaps delve deeper into specific biblical references that support their points. Overall, a strong response."
