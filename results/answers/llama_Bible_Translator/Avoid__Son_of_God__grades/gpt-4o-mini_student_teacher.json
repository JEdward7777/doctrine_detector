  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response that balances accuracy with cultural sensitivity, suggesting practical steps to address potential misunderstandings without compromising the theological integrity of the term \"Son of God.\" The emphasis on contextualization, clarification, alternative translations, consultation with experts, and maintaining theological accuracy reflects a nuanced understanding of the issue at hand. However, the student's approach may be considered slightly cautious, as they lean towards accommodating cultural concerns rather than emphasizing the importance of teaching the true meaning of the term through context and explanation, as suggested in the reference answer. Overall, the response is thorough, thoughtful, and shows a commendable effort to address the concern raised in a Christian-specific worldview."
