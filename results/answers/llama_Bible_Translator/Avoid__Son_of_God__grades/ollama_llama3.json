  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nThe response aligns well with the given answer, emphasizing that while \"Son of God\" might require contextualization and clarification in certain cultures, it should not be avoided altogether. The concern about avoidance leading to theological gaps is also addressed through the proposal of contextualizing, clarifying, using alternative translations, consulting with local experts, and maintaining theological accuracy.\n\nThe only reason for not giving a perfect score is that the response could have more explicitly stated the dangers of avoiding the term \"Son of God\" in polytheistic cultures. The concern mentioned suggests that this avoidance can lead to significant misunderstandings about Jesus' identity, but the response does not directly address this issue. Nonetheless, the proposed solutions effectively mitigate this concern and demonstrate a thoughtful approach to translating Scripture for diverse audiences.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a nuanced understanding of cultural sensitivity and theological accuracy in Bible translation. The proposals for contextualizing, clarifying, using alternative translations, consulting with local experts, and maintaining theological integrity are all well-reasoned and effective in addressing potential misunderstandings about Jesus' identity."
