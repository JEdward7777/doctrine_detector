The suggested approach of contextualizing, providing additional information, offering alternative translations where needed, consulting with local experts, and maintaining theological accuracy aligns well with a Christian worldview of accurately conveying the biblical message while being sensitive to cultural differences. The response demonstrates a thoughtful and comprehensive strategy for addressing potential misunderstandings while upholding the theological integrity of the Scripture."
