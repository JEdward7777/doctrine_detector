The suggested steps demonstrate a balanced understanding of the importance of maintaining biblical integrity while addressing potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures. Overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the necessity of teaching and explaining the term rather than avoiding it, thus effectively addressing the concern raised."
