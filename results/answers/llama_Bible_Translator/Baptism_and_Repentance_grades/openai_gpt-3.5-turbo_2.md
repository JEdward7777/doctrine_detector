## [Answer](../Baptism_and_Repentance.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In the New Testament, repentance and baptism are closely linked, particularly in the early Christian movement described in Acts and the Epistles. Here's how:

1. **Repentance precedes baptism**: In many instances, such as Acts 2:38, 8:12, 9:35-42, 10:47-48, and 11:18, repentance is mentioned before or alongside baptism. This order suggests that repentance was a necessary condition for baptism.
2. **Repentance leads to faith**: Repentance is often linked with faith in Jesus Christ (Acts 3:19; Mark 1:15). In this sense, repenting of one's old way of life and turning to God implies faith in Jesus as the Messiah and Savior.
3. **Baptism is a public declaration of faith**: Baptism, as an act of obedience to Jesus' command (Matthew 28:19), serves as a public declaration of one's faith in Him. By being baptized, individuals demonstrate their commitment to following Christ and identifying with His death, burial, and resurrection (Romans 6:1-11).
4. **Repentance and baptism are a single, unified act**: In some cases, such as Acts 8:22-24, the language used suggests that repentance and baptism are a single, unified act of turning to God. This unity is also implied in Peter's sermon at Pentecost (Acts 2:37-41), where repentance and baptism are presented as two sides of the same coin.
5. **Baptism is not simply a ritual or ceremony**: In the New Testament, baptism is not merely a sacramental act, but rather an integral part of the process of coming to faith in Jesus Christ. It's a visible expression of one's inner transformation, demonstrating their commitment to follow God and be identified with Jesus' saving work.

In summary, repentance precedes or accompanies baptism, as it leads people to have faith in Jesus and publicly declare their commitment to Him through baptism. Repentance and baptism are closely linked, forming a single act of turning to God and being identified with Jesus' saving work.
