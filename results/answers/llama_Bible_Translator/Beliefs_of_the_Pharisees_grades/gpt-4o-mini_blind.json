  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 90. \n\nThe answer provides a comprehensive overview of the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings based on Jewish texts such as the Mishnah and Talmud. The student correctly identifies key beliefs such as resurrection, the intermediate state, angels and demons, heaven and hell, and intercession. The inclusion of scriptural references and Talmudic sources adds depth to the response.\n\nHowever, to earn a perfect score, the student could have strengthened their answer by further emphasizing the Pharisees' adherence to the oral traditions and interpretations of the law, which influenced their beliefs on these matters. Additionally, mentioning the Pharisees' emphasis on righteous behavior and obedience to the law as essential for a favorable afterlife outcome would have enhanced the doctrinal accuracy of the response. Overall, this is a well-researched and well-written answer."
