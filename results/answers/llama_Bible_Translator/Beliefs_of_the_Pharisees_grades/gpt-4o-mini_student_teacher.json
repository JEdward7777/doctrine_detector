  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that delves into various aspects of Pharisaic beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings, drawing from both Jewish texts and references in the New Testament. The inclusion of specific teachings and references adds depth to the response and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. However, the student could have tied back the beliefs more explicitly to the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time to establish a clearer connection to the given concern, which would have enhanced the overall coherence of the response."
