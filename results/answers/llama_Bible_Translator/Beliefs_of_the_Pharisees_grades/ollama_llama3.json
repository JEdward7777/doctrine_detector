  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response goes beyond the minimal requirement of simply stating that the Pharisees believed in life after death and spiritual beings, providing specific details about their views on resurrection, intermediate state, angels and demons, heaven and hell, and intercession. The inclusion of scriptural references from Jewish texts such as the Mishnah and Talmud also demonstrates a good understanding of the Pharisees' beliefs.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more depth and analysis of these beliefs, exploring their implications for our understanding of Jesus' message and ministry. For example, how did the Pharisees' views on life after death influence their understanding of Jesus' teachings about the kingdom of God? How did their beliefs about spiritual beings shape their interactions with Jesus?\n\nOverall, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the Pharisees' beliefs, but could benefit from more nuanced exploration and analysis."
