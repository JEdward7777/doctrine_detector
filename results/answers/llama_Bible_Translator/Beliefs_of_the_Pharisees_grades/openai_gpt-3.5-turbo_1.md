The Pharisees, as a sect within Judaism during the time of Jesus, held certain beliefs about life after death and spiritual beings that are recorded in Jewish texts such as the Mishnah and the Talmud. While we can't know for certain how every individual Pharisee thought on these matters, I'll summarize their generally accepted views:

1. Resurrection: The Pharisees believed in a bodily resurrection of the dead at the end of time. This was in contrast to the Sadducees, who denied the idea of an afterlife and rejected the concept of immortality (Matthew 22:23; Mark 12:18). According to the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 10:1), "All Israel has a share in the world to come" â€“ implying that every Jewish person would participate in some form of afterlife.
2. Intermediate State: The Pharisees likely believed in an intermediate state between physical death and resurrection, where the soul or spirit would exist in a realm separate from the living. This concept is alluded to in Luke 16:19-31, where Abraham's bosom (or paradise) serves as a place of comfort for the righteous between their deaths and the final judgment.
3. Angels and Demons: The Pharisees acknowledged the existence of angels and demons (Talmudic tractate Chagigah 2a). They believed that these spiritual beings could influence human affairs, with good angels serving as messengers and advocates for God's people, while evil spirits opposed them (Deuteronomy 32:17; Psalm 106:37).
4. Heaven and Hell: The Pharisees likely held to a dualistic view of the afterlife, with heaven being a place of reward for the righteous and hell serving as punishment for the wicked. This is suggested by Jesus' references to Gehenna (Matthew 5:22; 10:28) and paradise (Luke 16:19-31).
5. Intercession: Pharisees likely believed that prayer could have an impact on the spiritual realm, with good angels interceding on behalf of the faithful and evil spirits attempting to thwart their prayers.

It's essential to note that these beliefs were not uniform among all Pharisees, as there was a range of opinions within this Jewish sect. However, these views provide a general outline of their understanding regarding life after death and spiritual beings.
