## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
A great question!

The phrase "Fear not" or "Do not fear" (Hebrew: אַל תִּירָא, Al Tiyrah; Greek: Μὴ φοβοῦ, Mē phobou) is a common refrain in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament. When God says "Fear not," it's an invitation for believers to trust in His sovereignty, love, and provision.

In biblical terms, fear (Hebrew: יִרְאָה, Yirah; Greek: φόβος, Phobos) is a natural human response to uncertainty, danger, or the unknown. However, when believers are instructed to "Fear not," God is essentially saying, "Do not let your fears and anxieties consume you. Instead, trust in Me, your loving Father."

This phrase often accompanies God's promises of protection, deliverance, and guidance. For example:

* "And do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are against us" (Deuteronomy 31:6).
* "Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine" (Isaiah 43:1).
* "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you walk through fire, you will not be scorched, nor will the flames burn you. You will fear no evil" (Isaiah 43:2-3).

In these contexts, God's "Fear not" is an expression of His presence, power, and care for His people. It's as if He's saying, "I've got this. Don't worry; I'm in control."

As Christians, we can apply this principle to our daily lives. When we're faced with uncertainty or fear, we can remind ourselves that God is always with us (Matthew 28:20) and that His promises are true (2 Timothy 1:7). By trusting in His sovereignty and love, we can overcome our fears and anxieties, knowing that He is our rock, shelter, and stronghold.

In summary, when God says "Fear not," it's an invitation to trust in His goodness, power, and provision. It's a reminder that, as believers, we are never alone or forsaken, and that our ultimate hope lies in the promises of His Word.
