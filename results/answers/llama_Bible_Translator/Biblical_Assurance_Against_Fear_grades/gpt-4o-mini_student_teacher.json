  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thorough explanation of the phrase \"Fear not\" in the Bible, highlighting important biblical references and implications for believers. They effectively conveyed the message of trusting in God's sovereignty and love rather than giving in to fear. However, the student's response could have been more concise and directly focused on the specific concern of understanding God's encouragement to not fear in order to strengthen faith and trust."
