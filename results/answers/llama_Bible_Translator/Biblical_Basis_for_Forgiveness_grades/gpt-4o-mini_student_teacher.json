  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 80. The student did a commendable job in providing relevant Bible verses that emphasize the importance of forgiveness among individuals. However, the student included verses like Luke 17:3-4 and Mark 11:25-26 that, while touching on themes related to forgiveness, do not specifically focus on forgiveness itself as directly as the provided key verses. Additionally, the student's explanation and application of the verses were thoughtful and tied back to the Christian faith. Overall, a solid effort with room for slight improvement in staying closely aligned with the specific concern provided."
