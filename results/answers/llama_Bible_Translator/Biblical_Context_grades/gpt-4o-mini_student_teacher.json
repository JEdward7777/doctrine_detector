  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response an 80.\n\nThe student provided a thorough and well-supported answer using various relevant passages from the New Testament to discuss the responsibilities of deacons. They highlighted the practical aspects of serving widows, emphasized the importance of moral character and spiritual maturity, and connected the role of deacons to the broader theme of serving others in the church.\n\nWhile the student's answer did not directly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as explicitly as the reference answer did, they did touch on the aspect of serving widows, which can be seen as a form of caring for a vulnerable group within the church. The student demonstrated a solid understanding of the biblical passages related to deacons' responsibilities.\n\nOverall, the student's response was well-structured and informative, earning a solid grade."
