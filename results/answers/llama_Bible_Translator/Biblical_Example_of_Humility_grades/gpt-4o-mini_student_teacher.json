  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-written answer, showcasing a strong knowledge of the biblical character Moses and how his life exemplified humility. However, the teacher specifically asked for an example of humility in David, not Moses. While the student's response is insightful and aligned with a Christian worldview, it missed the mark by not addressing the specific concern provided."
