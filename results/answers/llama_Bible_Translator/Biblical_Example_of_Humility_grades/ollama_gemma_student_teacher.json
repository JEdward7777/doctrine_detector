The response effectively addresses the concern about finding tangible examples in the scriptures. \n\nThe student clearly identifies Moses' initial feelings of inadequacy and his subsequent obedience to God's call. They also highlight his humility in prayer, facing opposition, and his willingness to accept God's judgment. The inclusion of additional aspects of humility learned from Moses' life adds depth to the analysis.\n\nThe connection to Christian values is appropriate and reinforces the idea that humility is essential for true greatness in God's eyes."
