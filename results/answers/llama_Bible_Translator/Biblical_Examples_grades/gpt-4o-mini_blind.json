  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a solid overview of biblical figures who are cited as examples of being blameless and offers insightful takeaways from their lives. The student effectively references key passages to support their points and draws meaningful lessons from the lives of Job, Noah, Abraham, Enoch, and David. However, there is room for improvement in emphasizing the importance of Christ as the ultimate example of blamelessness for Christians to follow. Connecting the virtues displayed by these figures to the redemptive work of Christ could strengthen the theological depth of the response."
