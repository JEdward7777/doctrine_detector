The references to Genesis 1:28-31, Genesis 9:15-17, and Psalm 104:24-25 effectively highlight God's blessings on humanity and all living creatures. The response was well-explained and demonstrated a strong biblical knowledge. However, the specific example of Genesis 1:22 mentioned by the teacher could have been included to further strengthen the answer."
