## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

Yes, I can definitely provide an example from the Bible where God blesses creation.

One notable example is in Genesis 1:28-31, where we see God's blessing on all of creation, especially humanity. After creating Adam and Eve, God pronounces them "very good" (Genesis 1:31) and commissions them to multiply and fill the earth. This is a clear indication that God blesses his creation, including humans.

In Genesis 9:15-17, we also see God's blessing on all living creatures after the flood. God establishes a covenant with Noah and every living creature, promising never again to destroy the earth with a flood (Genesis 9:11). This covenant is an explicit expression of God's blessing on creation, affirming that He will maintain and sustain life on earth.

Additionally, Psalm 104:24-25 describes God's blessing on all His creations: "How many are your works! In wisdom you have made them all. The earth is full of your creatures." This psalm reflects the general attitude found throughout Scripture, acknowledging God as the Creator and Sustainer of all things.

These examples illustrate that God blesses creation in various ways, demonstrating His power, love, and care for all He has made.

What are your thoughts on this topic? Would you like to explore more biblical passages or theological aspects related to God's blessing on creation?
