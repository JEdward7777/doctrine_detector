What a great question!

In the Gospel accounts, we see several instances where Jesus' innocence is highlighted in contrast to the accusations brought against Him by His opponents. Here are a few examples:

1. The Pharisees accuse Jesus of breaking the Sabbath (Mark 2:23-28). They claim that He's doing evil on the Sabbath, but Jesus responds by pointing out their own hypocrisy and lack of understanding about the true intent behind the Sabbath commandment.

Scripture example: "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath" (Mark 2:27).

This passage highlights Jesus' innocence as He shows that His actions are motivated by compassion and a desire to help others, rather than any malicious intent. The Pharisees' accusations, on the other hand, reveal their own hardness of heart.

2. The Jewish leaders accuse Jesus of being demon-possessed (John 7:20-24). They claim He's possessed by Satan because He's performing miraculous signs and wonders that are only possible for God to do. However, Jesus responds by pointing out His good works and the fact that He's performing these miracles in harmony with God's will.

Scripture example: "Jesus answered them, 'I have done one thing and you all marvel at it. But I do as my Father has enabled me'" (John 5:30-32).

This passage showcases Jesus' innocence as He reveals His dependence on the Father and the true source of His power. The Jewish leaders' accusations reflect their jealousy and misunderstanding of Jesus' mission.

3. The high priest accuses Jesus before the Sanhedrin, saying, "I put you under oath before God to tell us what you are doing? You're telling us that you're Christ, and you're not?" (Mark 14:58). This accusation is an attempt to trap Jesus into denying His messiahship or claiming it for himself. However, Jesus responds by affirming His true identity as the Son of God.

Scripture example: "I am; and you will see Me, but must wait until I come from the Father" (John 5:37).

This passage demonstrates Jesus' innocence as He remains steadfast in His testimony about who He is and what He's doing. The high priest's accusation reflects his own ignorance of Jesus' true nature and purpose.

In each of these instances, Jesus' innocence is highlighted by His words and actions, which are characterized by humility, compassion, and dependence on the Father. In contrast, the accusers' accusations reveal their own hardness of heart, jealousy, and misunderstanding of Jesus' mission.

These examples illustrate that, in the eyes of Scripture, Jesus was indeed innocent, and His opponents were motivated by sin and a lack of understanding about God's true plan.
