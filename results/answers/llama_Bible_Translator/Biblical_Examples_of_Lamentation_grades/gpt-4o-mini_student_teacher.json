They effectively connected each biblical figure's example to the importance of honest communication with God and trusting in His sovereignty. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern of how biblical lament can support personal growth and a deeper relationship with God. Encouraging the student to make more explicit connections between the biblical examples and the specified concern could further enhance the depth of their analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
