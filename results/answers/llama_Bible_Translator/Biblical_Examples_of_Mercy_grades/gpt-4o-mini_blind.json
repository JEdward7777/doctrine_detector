  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of key examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy. The examples chosen are appropriate and effectively demonstrate God's mercy towards His people. The student could enhance the answer by delving deeper into the theological implications of mercy, such as its connection to God's grace and justice. Additionally, incorporating more scriptural references to support each example would strengthen the answer. Overall, a well-written response that conveys a good understanding of the concept of mercy in the Bible."
