  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides insightful and detailed examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy, their answer could be improved by including a broader range of examples outside the ones commonly referenced. The student could also benefit from incorporating more real-life applications or personal reflections on how the concept of mercy is relevant in contemporary society. The use of additional scriptural references beyond the ones mentioned could further enhance the understanding of mercy."
