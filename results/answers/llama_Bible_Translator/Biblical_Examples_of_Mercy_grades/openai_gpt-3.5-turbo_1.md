## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Mercy.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a wonderful question! The concept of mercy is a vital aspect of God's character, and it's beautifully illustrated throughout Scripture. Here are some key examples:

1. **The Story of Joseph**: Genesis 37-47 tells the story of Joseph, who was sold into slavery by his brothers. Despite their betrayal, Joseph shows them mercy when he becomes their provider during a time of famine (Genesis 42:15-26). This is a powerful example of how God's people are to extend mercy even in the face of hurt and injustice.
2. **The Prodigal Son**: In Luke 15:11-32, a prodigal son returns home after squandering his inheritance. His father, symbolizing God's mercy, welcomes him back with open arms, forgiving his mistakes and throwing a party to celebrate (Luke 15:22-24).
3. **The Merciful Judge**: Psalm 103:1-14 describes God as a merciful judge who pardons sinners and heals the brokenhearted. Verse 10 says, "He has not dealt with us according to our sins. Nor punished us according to our iniquities." This passage highlights God's willingness to show mercy even when we don't deserve it.
4. **The Woman at the Well**: In John 4:1-26, Jesus encounters a Samaritan woman who has had five husbands and is currently living with someone else. Despite her sinful past, Jesus shows her mercy by having a meaningful conversation with her and offering spiritual refreshment (John 4:13-14).
5. **The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant**: In Matthew 18:21-35, Jesus tells a parable about a king who forgives his servant's debt but then expects the same forgiveness from the servant when he becomes indebted to another. This story illustrates the importance of showing mercy and forgiving others as God has forgiven us.
6. **The Story of David**: In 2 Samuel 12:1-14, King David commits adultery with Bathsheba, then tries to cover it up by having her husband Uriah killed in battle. After Nathan confronts him about his sin, David repents and receives forgiveness from God (Psalm 51). This story demonstrates that even those who have sinned greatly can experience mercy and restoration.

These examples illustrate the concept of mercy as a fundamental aspect of God's character and our relationship with Him. As Christians, we are called to extend mercy to others just as God has shown it to us (Matthew 7:1-2; Luke 6:36-38).
