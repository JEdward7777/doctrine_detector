  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided well-explained biblical references that illustrate the concept of transgression effectively. However, the student could improve their answer by including more concise and specific references as shown in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Adding references like 1 Thessalonians 4:6, Daniel 9:24-25, and Psalm 32:1 would enhance the overall quality of the response and provide a more comprehensive view of transgression in the Bible."
