The concept of transgression in the Bible refers to the act of disobeying or violating God's laws, commands, or moral standards. Here are some key biblical references that illustrate this concept:

1. Genesis 3:6-7 - The story of Adam and Eve's disobedience to God's command not to eat from the tree of knowledge is a prime example of transgression.

"And they said, 'Is it true that God has taken a leave of absence, saying, "You won't die; you'll just become like us"? Well, he must have known we'd be smart enough to figure out what's going on! And then we'll get the power of being like gods ourselves! So we took some fruit from the tree and ate it. We didn't wait for God to tell us whether this was right or wrong.'" (Genesis 3:6-7, J.B. Phillips Translation)

2. Genesis 11:1-9 - The story of the Tower of Babel describes humanity's attempt to defy God by building a tower that would reach heaven. This is another example of transgression.

"As they journeyed eastward, they came to a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there. They said to one another, 'Come now, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.' So they had bricks for stone, bitumen for mortar. Then they said, 'Let us go up to the city and build a tower with whose top reaches the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth.'" (Genesis 11:2-4, RSV)

3. Exodus 32:1-6 - After Moses received the Ten Commandments from God, the Israelites became impatient and demanded that Aaron create an idol for them to worship. This is another instance of transgression.

"When the people saw that Moses was a long time in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, 'Come now, make gods for us who shall go before us; as for this Moses, when he comes we will worship him.' Then Aaron took gold, and he shaped it with a graving tool, and made a golden calf. And they said, 'This is your god, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt.'" (Exodus 32:1-4, RSV)

4. Isaiah 53:3 - This passage describes the transgression of humanity as being "wounded" and "crushed" by their own sins.

"He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom the light has been taken away. He was crushed for our iniquities; he was punished for our transgressions." (Isaiah 53:3, KJV)

5. Hebrews 9:15 - This passage highlights the importance of Jesus Christ's sacrifice as a remedy for human transgression.

"For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the fears of death until the time when they should have had the fullness of life." (Hebrews 9:15, RSV)

These biblical references illustrate various instances of transgression throughout human history, and demonstrate the consequences of disobeying God's laws and commands.
