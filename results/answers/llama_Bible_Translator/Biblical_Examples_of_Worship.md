A great question!

Yes, one excellent example can be found in 1 Corinthians 6:13-20. In this passage, the apostle Paul is correcting the Corinthian church for their involvement in pagan rituals and sexual immorality. He writes:

"Flee from the evil desires of your hearts! If you give in to those desires, they will ruin you. But if you seek good, you will find me. And when you cry out for help, I will hear you. When you obey my commands, you will show that you love me even as I love each of you—far more than the greatest treasures and riches. For I sacrifice myself to make up for your sins. Shouldn't you give yourselves to me just as I have given myself to you? Don't you know that your bodies are temples for the Holy Spirit, who lives in you? You do not belong to yourselves; God bought you at a high price."

Paul then contrasts this with idol worship:

"You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies." (1 Corinthians 6:20)

In this passage, Paul is emphasizing the importance of honoring God with our bodies and lives, in contrast to the pagan practices of idol worship that would lead to ruin. He's highlighting the sacredness of our bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit, and warning against compromising that sacredness through participation in idolatrous or immoral activities.

This passage serves as a powerful reminder that true worship is not about external rituals or offerings, but about honoring God with our entire being – heart, soul, mind, and strength. In contrast, idol worship (whether literal or figurative) is an affront to this kind of holy living, and can lead to ruin and spiritual decay.
