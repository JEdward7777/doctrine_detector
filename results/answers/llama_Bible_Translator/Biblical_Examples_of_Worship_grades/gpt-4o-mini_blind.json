  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a good analysis of 1 Corinthians 6:13-20 and accurately identifies the contrast between true worship of God and idol worship. The explanation is clear and highlights the importance of honoring God with our entire being. However, the student could strengthen the response by providing a more direct and concise answer to the question at the beginning of the response and by incorporating more specific references to idol worship in the passage cited. Overall, a solid answer with room for improvement in clarity and specificity."
