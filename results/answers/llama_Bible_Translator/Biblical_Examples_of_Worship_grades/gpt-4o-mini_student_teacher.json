  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student's response effectively identifies a passage from the Bible (1 Corinthians 6:13-20) that contrasts worshipping God with idol worship. They provide a detailed explanation of how the passage emphasizes the importance of honoring God with our bodies and lives, contrasting it with pagan practices that lead to ruin. The student effectively connects the importance of avoiding idolatry with remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. However, the student could have provided a more direct and concise example that mirrored the reference answer in Exodus 20:3. Overall, the student's response shows a solid understanding of the concern and the biblical principles involved."
