  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of the directive Jesus gave to his apostles regarding the good news, referencing Matthew 28:18-20 accurately and explaining the significance of the Great Commission for Christian evangelism and missions. The only minor improvement could be further elaboration on the importance of making disciples in addition to spreading the good news. Overall, well-done with doctrinal accuracy and clarity."
