## Correct Answer
Jesus sent his apostles out to spread the good news about how to be part of Godâ€™s kingdom through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Matthew 28:18-20, Jesus gave the following directive to his apostles:

"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."

In this passage, Jesus is giving his apostles a clear commission to spread the good news (or gospel) of God's salvation to people from every nation. He instructs them to baptize new believers in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and to teach them to obey all that he has commanded.

This directive is often referred to as the "Great Commission" and serves as a foundational text for Christian evangelism and missions.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately states that Jesus sent his apostles out to spread the good news, which is in line with the correct answer provided. However, it does not explicitly mention the "Great Commission" or the importance of evangelism, as mentioned in the concern.

While the response mentions trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin, it does not elaborate on what this means or how it relates to spreading the good news. Additionally, there is no clear connection made between the apostles' commission and the Christian faith.

Overall, while the response is partially correct and touches on some of the key elements, it could be more detailed and explicit in its treatment of the Great Commission and its significance for evangelism.
