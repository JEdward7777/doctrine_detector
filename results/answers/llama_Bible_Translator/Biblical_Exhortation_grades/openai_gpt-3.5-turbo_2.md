## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Matthew 28:18-20, Jesus gave the following directive to his apostles:

"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."

In this passage, Jesus is giving his apostles a clear commission to spread the good news (or gospel) of God's salvation to people from every nation. He instructs them to baptize new believers in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and to teach them to obey all that he has commanded.

This directive is often referred to as the "Great Commission" and serves as a foundational text for Christian evangelism and missions.
