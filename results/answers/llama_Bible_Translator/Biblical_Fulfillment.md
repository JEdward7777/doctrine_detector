## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the New Testament (specifically, John 18:33 and 19:14) are rooted in Old Testament prophecies. In the Old Testament, God had prophesied that a future Messiah would come from the line of Judah (Genesis 49:10) and would be a ruler over Israel (2 Samuel 7:12-13).

One significant prophecy is found in Psalm 2:1-6, which speaks of a coming king who will be rejected by the nations but accepted by God. The psalmist writes:

"Why do the nations conspire
and the peoples plot in vain?
The kings of the earth take their stand
against the Lord and against his anointed one.

He rebukes them sharply:
'You foolish people,
and you sons of men.'
He says to them, 'I have installed my king
on Zion, my holy mountain.'"

In this passage, God is prophesying that a future Messiah will be anointed by Him to rule over Israel. This Messiah-King will be rejected by the nations, but accepted by God.

Another relevant prophecy can be found in Zechariah 9:9-10:

"Rejoice greatly, O Daughter of Zion!
Shout, Daughter of Jerusalem!
See, your king comes to you,
gentle and riding on a donkey,
on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

He will proclaim peace to the nations;
his reign will be from sea to sea,
from the Tigris River to the ends of the earth."

In this passage, God is prophesying that the Messiah-King would come peacefully, riding on a donkey, and would bring salvation to all nations. This prophecy is fulfilled in Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, where he rode a donkey (Matthew 21:1-11).

When Pontius Pilate asks Jesus "So you are a king?" (John 18:33), Jesus responds by saying, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight. But now my kingdom is from another realm." This response highlights the messianic nature of Jesus' kingship, which is not about earthly power or politics but rather about spiritual authority and salvation.

In summary, the references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the New Testament reflect Old Testament prophecies that spoke of a future Messiah-King who would be anointed by God to rule over Israel and bring salvation to all nations.
