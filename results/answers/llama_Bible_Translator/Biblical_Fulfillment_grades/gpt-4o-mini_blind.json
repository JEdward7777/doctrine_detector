The student effectively connects specific Old Testament passages such as Genesis 49, 2 Samuel 7, Psalm 2, and Zechariah 9 with the New Testament portrayal of Jesus as the Messiah-King. The explanation is well-supported with scriptural references and shows a solid understanding of the biblical significance of Jesus' kingship in relation to Old Testament prophecy. Great job!"
