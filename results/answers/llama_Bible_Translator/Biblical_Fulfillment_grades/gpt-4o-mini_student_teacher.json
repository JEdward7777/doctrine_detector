  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-supported explanation connecting the references to Jesus as \"King of the Jews\" with Old Testament prophecies. They have mentioned specific passages such as Psalm 2 and Zechariah 9 that foreshadow Jesus' role as the Messiah-King. The student also effectively ties in the significance of Jesus' response to Pontius Pilate regarding the nature of His kingdom. However, the student's answer could be improved by directly addressing the concern of establishing an everlasting kingdom as stated in the reference answer."
