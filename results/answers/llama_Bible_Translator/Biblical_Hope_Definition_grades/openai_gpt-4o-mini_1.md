## [Answer](../Biblical_Hope_Definition.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In a biblical context, the term "hope" (Greek: elpis; Hebrew: tikvah) signifies confident expectation or longing for something that is believed to be attainable through God's promises and actions. Biblical hope is rooted in God's character, Word, and purposes, and it looks forward to a future reality that is yet to come.

In the Bible, hope is often associated with salvation, redemption, and eternal life (Romans 8:24-25; Hebrews 11:10). It is characterized by:

1. Confidence in God's promises: Biblical hope is built on the trustworthiness of God's Word and His character as revealed in Scripture (Hebrews 6:18-19).
2. Expectation of a future reality: Hope looks forward to a new heavens and a new earth, where God will restore creation and make all things right (Revelation 21:1-5; Isaiah 65:17-25).
3. Trust in God's sovereignty: Biblical hope is grounded in the understanding that God is sovereign over all things, including human history, and that He is working out His purposes for those who love Him (Romans 8:28-30).
4. Perseverance in difficult circumstances: Hope enables believers to persevere through trials and difficulties, knowing that their ultimate hope is not in this life but in the eternal life to come (1 Peter 1:3-9; Hebrews 12:1-3).

In contrast to worldly hopes, which are often based on uncertain or fleeting things, biblical hope is:

* Certain: Based on God's promises and His Word, which are unchanging and reliable.
* Permanent: Lasting beyond this life and into eternity.
* Satisfying: Bringing ultimate fulfillment and joy in the presence of God.

As believers, we are called to cultivate a robust faith-based hope that anchors us in these uncertain times and gives us a sense of direction and purpose for living (Hebrews 10:23-25).
