The student effectively references key biblical passages and events to support their points, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic. The inclusion of the need for sacrificial covering and the ultimate consequence of eternal separation from God adds depth to the discussion. Overall, this response aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively communicates the gravity of sin and the hope found in Jesus Christ."
