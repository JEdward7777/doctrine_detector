## [Answer](../Biblical_References_2.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a wonderful question! The Bible is replete with passages that exalt God's majesty, power, and glory. Here are some notable examples:

1. Psalm 93:1-2 - "The Lord reigns; he is robed in majesty. The Lord is clothed with strength; he has girded himself with power."

This passage highlights God's kingly authority and His ability to govern the universe.

2. Isaiah 40:25-26 - "To whom will you compare me? Or who is like me, that I should be compared as your equal? With whom did you consult to know it all? From ages past no one has heard, no one has given ear. No one understands; no one can give an answer and say, 'It is too amazing for me'."

These verses emphasize God's uniqueness and His inability to be compared or rivalled by any created being.

3. Job 38:1-7 - "Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind. He said: 'Who is this that darkens counsel with words without knowledge? Gird up your loins like a man; I will question you, and you shall tell me.'

"But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you; or ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you. Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or have the fish of the sea inform you. Which of these can understand? Which of them disperse their knowledge like mortals do?"

This passage showcases God's wisdom, power, and authority over creation.

4. Revelation 4:8-11 - "Each of the four living creatures had six wings: they were covered with eyes around the clock, day and night. Day and night they never stopped saying: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come!' Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one sitting on the throne—the one who lives forever and ever—the twenty-four elders fall down before him. They worship the one who is eternal and always alive; they go into his presence with the hymn: 'You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power.'"

This passage describes the heavenly worship of God's majesty, with all creation acknowledging His holiness and power.

5. Psalm 97:1-2 - "The Lord reigns, let earth rejoice! The peoples even break forth in joy. For you, Lord, are most high over all the nations; your glory is above all heaven."

This passage emphasizes God's universal sovereignty and His exalted position above all creation.

These verses illustrate God's majesty by highlighting His:

* Sovereignty (Psalm 93:1-2)
* Uniqueness (Isaiah 40:25-26)
* Wisdom, power, and authority over creation (Job 38:1-7)
* Holiness and worship in heaven (Revelation 4:8-11)
* Universal reign and glory (Psalm 97:1-2)

These passages demonstrate the magnitude of God's majesty, leaving us in awe of His greatness.
