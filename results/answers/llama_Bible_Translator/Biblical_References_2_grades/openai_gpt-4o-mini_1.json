  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 95.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough and thoughtful response by referencing specific Bible passages that clearly illustrate God's majesty through His sovereignty, uniqueness, wisdom, power, authority over creation, holiness, and universal reign. The selected passages effectively demonstrate the concept of God's majesty by highlighting various aspects of His character and attributes as depicted in the Bible. The student's analysis and explanation of each passage further enhance the understanding of God's majestic nature as portrayed in scripture. The response is well-structured, informative, and aligns with a Christian worldview in connecting the referenced verses to the concept of God's majesty.\n\nThe only point that could potentially enhance this response further is including a brief explanation or connection to how the additional Bible references provided in the given answer also contribute to understanding God's majestic nature. This would have strengthened the argument by incorporating a broader range of scriptural insights on the topic. Nonetheless, the response is strong and deserving of a high grade."
