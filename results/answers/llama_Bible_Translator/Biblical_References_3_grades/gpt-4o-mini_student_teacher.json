  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how the concept of the \"Son of Man\" in the Old Testament contributes to the understanding of Jesus as the Messiah. They referenced key passages from Daniel and Ezekiel and drew clear parallels between the Old Testament figures and Jesus in the New Testament. However, the student's response could have been strengthened by focusing more on the specific references mentioned in the teacher's answer to align closely with the concern provided."
