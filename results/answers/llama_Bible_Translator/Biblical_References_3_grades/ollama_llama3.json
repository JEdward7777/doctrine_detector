  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive overview of the Old Testament references related to the \"Son of Man\" title, highlighting its significance in both Daniel and Ezekiel. It also explores the connection between these passages and Jesus' identification as the Son of Man in the New Testament. The discussion is well-organized, and the writer effectively draws out the themes of authority, judgment, and prophetic identity associated with the Son of Man.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have delved more deeply into the ways in which these Old Testament passages specifically inform our understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the Son of Man. Additionally, while the writer mentions the connection between Daniel 7:14 and Jesus' coming with clouds (Revelation 1:7), a more explicit exploration of this connection would have strengthened the response.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the Old Testament background and its relevance to our understanding of Jesus as the Son of Man."
