  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-supported response that effectively explores how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' The answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the key Old Testament references related to the title 'Son of Man' and effectively connects them to the portrayal of Jesus in the New Testament. The response could have been strengthened by providing more analysis and insight into the significance of the Son of Man title in both the Old and New Testaments, but overall, it is thorough and insightful."
