## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of the "Son of Man" in the Old Testament plays a crucial role in our understanding of Jesus Christ as the Messiah. The term "Son of Man" is used 14 times in the Old Testament, primarily in the book of Daniel (7:13-14, 22, 27; 10:5; 12:1) and the book of Ezekiel (2:1; 3:1; 3:17; 4:1; 6:1; 8:2; 11:23).

In Daniel, the Son of Man is described as a divine figure who comes to judge humanity. This passage sets the stage for the New Testament's depiction of Jesus as the Son of Man, who will come to judge and rule on behalf of God (Matthew 25:31-46; Revelation 1:7). The Son of Man in Daniel is also depicted as having authority given to him by God, which is echoed in Jesus' claim to authority over all creation (Matthew 28:18).

In Ezekiel, the Son of Man is often referred to as a prophetic figure who represents God's presence and judgment. This passage emphasizes the importance of accountability for one's actions before the divine throne.

The Old Testament references that contribute to our understanding of Jesus as the Messiah through his title "Son of Man" are:

1. Daniel 7:13-14 - The Son of Man is given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, which will never be destroyed.
2. Daniel 10:5 - The Son of Man is described as having a shining appearance, like a divine being.
3. Daniel 12:1 - The Son of Man is said to come with clouds and reward those who sleep in death.
4. Ezekiel 2:1 - God commands the prophet to speak through the Spirit of God, likening him to a son of man.
5. Ezekiel 3:1-15 - The Son of Man receives visions from God and is called to be God's messenger.

These passages collectively convey that the Son of Man is a divine figure who has authority and power over all creation, will come to judge humanity, and represents God's presence on earth. This understanding sets the stage for Jesus' identification as the Son of Man in the New Testament (Matthew 8:20; Mark 13:26; Luke 5:24).
