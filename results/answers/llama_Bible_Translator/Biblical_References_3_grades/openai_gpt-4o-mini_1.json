The use of key references from Daniel and Ezekiel effectively supports the connection between the title 'Son of Man' and the prophetic identity of Jesus Christ as the Messiah. The response could be enhanced by further elaboration on how these Old Testament passages specifically shape the New Testament portrayal of Jesus as the Son of Man in terms of judgment, authority, and divine presence."
