The student effectively references key passages from Daniel and Ezekiel, demonstrating a clear understanding of how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.' Additionally, the response includes relevant biblical verses to support the argument. Overall, a well-researched and well-structured response. Great job!"
