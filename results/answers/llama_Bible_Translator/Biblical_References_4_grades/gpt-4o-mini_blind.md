Can you give examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11, where 'Lord' references the authority and divinity of God.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing biblical references helps reinforce the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord.

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_4.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the term "Lord" (Hebrew: Adonai; Greek: Kyrios) is often used as a title of reverence and honor for God. Here are some examples:

1. Psalm 23:1 - "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing." In this famous passage, David addresses God as his Lord, highlighting His care and provision.
2. Exodus 15:26 - "Then it will be said: 'This is what the Lord has done for me. That which he did for Israel will I do for you, and you shall multiply in the land.'" Moses uses the term "Lord" to refer to God's mighty acts on behalf of His people.
3. Matthew 11:25-27 - Jesus addresses God as "Father" but also uses the term "Lord" (Kyrios) when praying, demonstrating the unity of Father and Son. This passage highlights the Lordship of God over all creation.

In these examples, the term "Lord" is used to convey respect, awe, and dependence on God's authority, sovereignty, and provision. When we use this title for God in our prayers or conversations, it reflects our recognition of His majesty, power, and loving care.

As Christians, we understand that the term "Lord" also has implications for our relationship with God. As believers, we have been given the privilege of calling Him "Abba, Father" (Romans 8:15), but in acknowledging His Lordship, we recognize His authority over all aspects of life and submit to His will.

How would you like me to elaborate on this further or provide more examples?
