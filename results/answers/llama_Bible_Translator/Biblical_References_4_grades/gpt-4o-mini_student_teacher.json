  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 80.\n\nThe student provided relevant biblical examples that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God, demonstrating an understanding of the term's significance in acknowledging God's authority and sovereignty. The examples chosen effectively highlight the reverence, honor, and dependence associated with addressing God as Lord. Additionally, the student touched on the implications of God's Lordship in a believer's life, showing a deeper reflection on the theological implications of using this title for God.\n\nHowever, the response could have been improved by incorporating the specific biblical references mentioned in the teacher's reference answer (Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11) to align more closely with the concern provided. By including these additional examples, the student's answer would have been more comprehensive in demonstrating a holistic understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord."
