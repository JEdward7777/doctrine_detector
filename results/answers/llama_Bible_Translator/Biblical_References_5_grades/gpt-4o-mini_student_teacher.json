  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of how 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings, emphasizing the analogy between removing leaven and spiritual purification. While the student's interpretation is thorough and insightful, they should have directly referenced the specific verses mentioned in the teacher's answer (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) for perfect alignment."
