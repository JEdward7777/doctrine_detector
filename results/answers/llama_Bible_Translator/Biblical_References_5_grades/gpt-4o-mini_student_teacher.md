## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The New Testament scripture that connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings is 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, which says:

"Clean out the old yeast so you may be a new batch without yeastâ€”a batch without sin. And if I am not doing what I do not want to do, then neither can I do it."

In this passage, the Apostle Paul is drawing an analogy between the Jewish practice of removing leaven (yeast) from bread before baking and the process of spiritual purification that Christians experience through Jesus Christ.

Paul uses the metaphor of "leaven" to describe sin and its corrupting influence in our lives. He instructs the Corinthian believers to "clean out the old yeast" - in other words, to eliminate sin and its effects from their lives - so they can be a new creation without sin.

This passage connects the concept of unleavened bread (or "unleavened dough") with Christian teachings by highlighting the importance of spiritual purification and the need for believers to put off their old selves and put on the new self in Christ.

Comment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of how 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings, emphasizing the analogy between removing leaven and spiritual purification. While the student's interpretation is thorough and insightful, they should have directly referenced the specific verses mentioned in the teacher's answer (1 Corinthians 5:6-8) for perfect alignment.
