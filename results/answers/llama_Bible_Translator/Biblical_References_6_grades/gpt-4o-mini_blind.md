What a wonderful topic! The concept of resurrection is a central doctrine in Christianity, and it's beautifully portrayed throughout the Scriptures. Here are some key verses that provide insight into this amazing truth:

1. Job 19:25-27 - "For I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth; And after my skin is thus destroyed, yet in my flesh shall I see God; I myself shall behold Him, without a stranger's help. Behold, my witness is in heaven! My advocate is One to whom I may speak."
	* This passage foreshadows the concept of physical resurrection, where Job expects to be reunited with his body and see God in person.
2. Isaiah 26:19 - "Your dead shall live, together with my corpses shall they rise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in dust!"
	* This verse prophesies the resurrection of both righteous and unrighteous people, emphasizing that all will be raised to eternal life or judgment.
3. Daniel 12:2-3 - "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. And those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament; and those who turn many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever."
	* Daniel's prophecy expands on the concept of resurrection, highlighting the distinction between eternal life and judgment.
4. John 5:28-29 - "Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice. And come forth, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation."
	* Jesus teaches about a future resurrection where both righteous and unrighteous people will be judged based on their deeds.
5. 1 Corinthians 15:20-26 - "But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But each one in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; afterward those who are Christ's at His coming."
	* Paul's passage emphasizes Jesus' victory over death and sin, establishing Him as the firstfruits of resurrection. It also highlights the future resurrection of believers.
6. 2 Corinthians 5:4-8 - "For we who are in this body groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed with our heavenly dwelling, that when these earthly bodies are wrapped up, we shall be clotheed without and within with the Heavenly. For our citizenship is from heaven, and we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform these lowly bodies of ours into their heavenly counterparts."
	* Paul describes the longing for a new, glorified body that will be raised at the resurrection.
7. Revelation 20:4-6 - "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, nor received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished."
	* This passage describes the millennium, where believers are resurrected to reign with Christ for 1,000 years, while unbelievers remain in Hades until the final judgment.

These verses provide a rich tapestry of insights into the concept of resurrection, highlighting its connection to Jesus' victory over sin and death.
