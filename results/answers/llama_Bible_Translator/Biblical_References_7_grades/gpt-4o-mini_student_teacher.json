  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful answer, citing relevant Bible passages that highlight the significance of the Sabbath in Christian faith. They effectively connected the concept of Sabbath observance to God's creation, the commandments, righteousness, and the rest offered by Jesus. However, the student missed referencing some key verses such as Exodus 31:14, Mark 2:27, and Isaiah 56:6-7, which the teacher identified as crucial in illustrating the importance of the Sabbath. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic but could have slightly improved by including all the specified references."
