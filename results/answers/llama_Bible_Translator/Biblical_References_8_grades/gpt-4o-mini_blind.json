  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student provided a good overview of the concept of ransom in biblical theology and referenced relevant verses. However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies and lack of depth in the explanation. The student could improve by explaining the concept of ransom more clearly in light of the broader biblical narrative and emphasizing the atonement aspect more prominently in their analysis. Additionally, there were some verses misquoted and misinterpreted, which impacted the overall accuracy of the response."
