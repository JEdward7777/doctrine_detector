  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of various Bible verses related to the concept of ransom, but the response lacks focus on the specific concern of exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. The inclusion of verses not directly related to the theology of redemption slightly detracts from the relevance of the answer. The student could improve by focusing more on the verses directly mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
