  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer is thorough and insightful, providing a comprehensive overview of the concept of covenant faithfulness in the Bible. They effectively cite various relevant scriptures to support their claims, and their explanations are clear and articulate. However, the response could benefit from including the two specific references requested in the prompt (Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18), which would elevate the response to a higher grade."
