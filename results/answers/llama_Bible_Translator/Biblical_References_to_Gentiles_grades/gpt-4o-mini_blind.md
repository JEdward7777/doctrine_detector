Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 are two crucial passages that shed light on the inclusion of Gentiles (non-Jewish people) in the Christian faith.

In Acts 9:13-16, we read about Saul's encounter with Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus. While Saul is blinded by a brilliant light, he hears a voice saying, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?" Saul asks, "Who are you, Lord?" The response is: "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting... Get up, and go into the city, and it will be told you what you must do." (Acts 9:5-6)

In verse 13, Ananias is told by Jesus to go to Saul, saying, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to bear my name before Gentiles, kings, and children of Israel." This passage highlights the commission given to Saul/Paul to preach the Gospel to all nations, including Gentiles.

In Galatians 2:16, Paul writes: "If I rebuild what I tore down, I make myself a transgressor. For it was not, those who are of the flesh will give birth to flesh and blood is flesh, but those who are of the Spirit will give birth to spirit." This passage is part of Paul's defense of his ministry among Gentiles against criticism from Peter and other Jewish Christians.

Here, Paul argues that he does not preach a different Gospel to Gentiles than he does to Jews. He says that if he preaches a Gospel that is based on works (e.g., circumcision, following the Mosaic law), then he would be making himself a transgressor. However, since his preaching is based on faith in Jesus Christ, he cannot be accused of doing anything other than what the Lord has commissioned him to do.

In both passages, we see the clear inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. Acts 9:13-16 highlights Paul's commission to preach to all nations, including Gentiles, while Galatians 2:16 underscores that the Gospel preached to Gentiles is the same as the one preached to Jews â€“ a message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, rather than works.

These passages demonstrate that the Christian faith is not limited to Jewish people or those who have undergone specific rituals (like circumcision). Instead, they emphasize that anyone, regardless of their ethnic background or religious affiliation, can become a part of the Christian community by putting their faith in Jesus Christ.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student has shown a good understanding of the passages and their significance in relation to the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. However, there are a few doctrinal inaccuracies in the explanation. Specifically, in Galatians 2:16, the student's interpretation regarding "those who are of the Spirit will give birth to spirit" is misleading. The statement actually emphasizes that salvation is through faith in Christ, not by works of the flesh. Additionally, the explanation could benefit from a more explicit connection between Acts 9:13-16 and the inclusion of Gentiles, rather than focusing solely on Paul's commission. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in doctrinal precision.
