It effectively addresses the concern by exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion, emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus over adherence to the law for justification. The integration of these passages with the specified concern is well done, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the Christian perspective on the inclusion of Gentiles in the early church. Great job!"
