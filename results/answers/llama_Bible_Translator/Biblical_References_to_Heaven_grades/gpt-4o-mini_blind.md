What a wonderful question! The Bible has much to say about heaven, and I'd be happy to share some key passages that provide insight into this beautiful concept.

1. **Matthew 5:3**: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." This verse highlights the ultimate goal of every believer: to have a personal, direct relationship with God in heaven.
2. **John 14:2**: "In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. For I go to prepare a place for you." Jesus is promising his disciples (and ultimately, all believers) that he will prepare a special place for them in heaven.
3. **Luke 16:19-31**: The parable of Lazarus and the rich man provides valuable insights into the afterlife. It teaches that there is a great chasm between heaven and hell, and that those who have rejected God's love will suffer eternal punishment.
4. **1 Corinthians 15:50-54**: Paul writes about the resurrection and the hope of being transformed into spiritual bodies in heaven. He says, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does perishability inherit imperishability."
5. **Revelation 21:1-27**: The book of Revelation describes heaven as a new Jerusalem, where God dwells among his people. It's a place of eternal joy, peace, and harmony.
6. **Matthew 25:31-46**: Jesus teaches that the ultimate judgment will be based on how we treated others while on earth. Those who showed love and compassion to others will inherit eternal life in heaven.
7. **Hebrews 12:22-24**: The writer of Hebrews describes heaven as a place where we can worship God without distraction, free from sin and its effects.
8. **Ephesians 2:5-10**: This passage highlights the incredible gift of salvation, which grants us access to heaven. It says, "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ."
9. **Isaiah 65:17-25**: This Old Testament passage speaks about a new heaven and a new earth, where God will restore creation and dwell among his people.
10. **2 Corinthians 5:1-8**: Paul writes about the desire to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, which is not made with human hands. He says, "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him according to the things he has done while in the body, whether good or bad."

These verses provide a glimpse into the wonderful reality of heaven, where believers will experience eternal joy, peace, and fellowship with God.
