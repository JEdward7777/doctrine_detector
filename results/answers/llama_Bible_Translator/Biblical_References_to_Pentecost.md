The Festival of Weeks, also known as Pentecost (Greek: πεντηκοστή), is a significant event in the biblical narrative that is referenced in several books of the New Testament. The festival commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the early Christian church 50 days after Jesus' resurrection.

Here are some key references to the Festival of Weeks/Pentecost:

1. Acts 2:1-47 - This book provides the most detailed account of Pentecost, describing how the apostles were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, resulting in a massive outpouring of people from diverse linguistic backgrounds gathered around them.
2. Luke 24:49-53 - Jesus commissions His disciples to wait for the promise of the Father, which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit that they would receive after His ascension.
3. John 7:37-39 - This passage references the prophetic words spoken by Jesus at the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) during His earthly ministry, where He declared that those who believed in Him would have access to living water.
4. Leviticus 23:15-21 - This book provides the original instructions for the Festival of Weeks/Pentecost as given by God to Moses.

In these passages, Pentecost is seen as a fulfillment of Jesus' promise to send the Holy Spirit to guide and empower His followers after His resurrection. It marked a significant turning point in the early Christian church, as believers were empowered to spread the message of salvation to all nations.
