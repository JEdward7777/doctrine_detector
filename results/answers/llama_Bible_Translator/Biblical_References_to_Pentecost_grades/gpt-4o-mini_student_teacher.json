  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-executed response, accurately referencing key passages in the New Testament that relate to the Festival of Weeks/Pentecost and its significance. They have demonstrated a clear understanding of how Pentecost is connected to the descent of the Holy Spirit and its importance in the early Christian church. However, the student missed referencing the Old Testament books specifically mentioned in the teacher's answer, which could have enhanced the completeness of their response."
