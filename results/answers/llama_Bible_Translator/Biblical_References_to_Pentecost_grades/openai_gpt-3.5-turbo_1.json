It correctly highlighted the importance of Pentecost as a fulfillment of Jesus' promise to send the Holy Spirit. However, the response would have been stronger with a more accurate and specific reference to the scriptural basis for Pentecost. It missed out on key references from 2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, and Numbers, which are crucial in understanding the historical and scriptural significance of Pentecost."
