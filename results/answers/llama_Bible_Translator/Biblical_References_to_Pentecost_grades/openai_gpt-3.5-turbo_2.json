  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: This response provides a good summary of the Festival of Weeks/Pentecost, highlighting key references and the significance of the event in the biblical narrative. However, the given answer is incorrect in stating that references to the Festival of Weeks can be found in 2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts. The correct references are Acts 2, Luke 24, John 7, and Leviticus 23, as listed in the response. The student should pay closer attention to accurately citing biblical references in relation to the Festival of Weeks to strengthen their understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost."
