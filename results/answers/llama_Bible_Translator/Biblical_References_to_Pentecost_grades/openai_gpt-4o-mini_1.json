  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides an accurate explanation of the Festival of Weeks/Pentecost, referring to key passages such as Acts 2:1-47, Luke 24:49-53, John 7:37-39, and Leviticus 23:15-21. However, the student's initial answer that mentions 2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts as references to the Festival of Weeks is incorrect. This mistake shows a lack of understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost, as the Festival of Weeks is primarily described in the Book of Exodus and Leviticus in the Old Testament and in the Book of Acts in the New Testament. The student should deepen their understanding of the specific biblical references related to Pentecost to improve their response."
