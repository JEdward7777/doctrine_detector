What a great question!

In 1 Timothy 4:10, it says, "For to this end we both labor and suffer until Christ is revealed, whether living or dead. Now she who is willing to be made manifest as trustworthy in what I am saying is one thing; but he is faithful who appointed me to the vespers, he also will establish me." (NKJV)

In this passage, Paul is emphasizing his dedication to preaching the gospel and sharing the message of Christ until He returns. The phrase "whether living or dead" suggests that Christ's revelation is not limited to a physical appearance on earth, but can also be seen in the lives of believers who are willing to suffer for their faith. This shows that salvation through Christ is not just about a one-time event, but a ongoing process of growth and sanctification.

As for 2 Peter 2:20-22, it says, "For if they did not escape when they refused Him who warned the pads from on high, shall escape also those who neglected so great a salvationâ€”presently being punished? The promise which preceded was not kept nor will the one that follows be kept. Before them we were made a spectacle in this present hour, but he is faithful who promised, and he is able to perform it." (NKJV)

In this passage, Peter is warning his readers about the dangers of apostasy and the consequences of rejecting God's salvation. He reminds them that those who refused to escape from Sodom and Gomorrah were punished, and that those who neglect the great salvation offered through Jesus Christ will also be punished. This passage highlights the importance of holding onto faith in Jesus Christ, as it is the only way to receive eternal life.

What these passages reveal about the nature of Christ as Savior is that He is:

1. Faithful: Both passages emphasize God's faithfulness in appointing and establishing Paul (1 Timothy 4:10) and promising salvation through Jesus Christ (2 Peter 2:20-22).
2. Sufficient: The promise of salvation through Jesus Christ is described as "so great" (2 Peter 2:20), emphasizing its sufficiency to save believers from sin and its consequences.
3. Ongoing: Salvation through Christ is not just a one-time event, but an ongoing process of growth and sanctification (1 Timothy 4:10).
4. Powerful: God's salvation is described as being able to perform what He has promised (2 Peter 2:20-22).

Overall, these passages reveal that Jesus Christ is the only way to receive eternal life, and that His salvation is faithful, sufficient, ongoing, and powerful.

Comment: The response provides a solid analysis of the passages from 1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20 in relation to the nature of Christ as Savior. The student effectively highlights key aspects such as Christ's faithfulness, sufficiency, ongoing work, and power in salvation. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved, such as providing more direct interpretation of the verses themselves and connecting them explicitly to the nature of Christ as Savior. Additionally, some statements could be clearer and more focused. Overall, it's a well-written response demonstrating a good understanding of the passages.
