  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the passages from 1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20, highlighting key points about the nature of Christ as Savior such as faithfulness, sufficiency, ongoing work, and power. The explanation was well-structured and connected back to the nature of Christ as Savior. However, the student could have drawn a more direct connection between the passages and the foundational belief in Jesus as Savior as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response with room for a slightly deeper focus on the specific concern provided."
