  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of the concept of Jesus as the Cornerstone, supported by relevant biblical verses and theological implications. It effectively conveys the significance of Jesus' role as the foundation of God's new creation and His ability to bring salvation and unity to humanity. The student could improve by directly mentioning Ephesians 2:20 which strengthens the argument about the church being built on Jesus as the Cornerstone. Great job overall."
