  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 90.\n\nThe student effectively references Psalm 118:22-23 and its New Testament connections in Matthew, Mark, and Luke to explain Jesus as the Cornerstone. They correctly convey the themes of Jesus' rejection, God's faithfulness, His role in the new creation (the church), and how He brings salvation and unity. However, the student missed including Acts 4:11 and Ephesians 2:20 in their explanation, which are additional verses that highlight the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone. Encouraging them to deepen their exploration of scriptures would enhance their understanding in this case."
