  "grade": 92.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 92.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the concept of Jesus as the Cornerstone, referencing relevant Scripture passages and elaborating on their meaning. The writer provides a clear and concise explanation of the metaphor, highlighting its significance in understanding Jesus' mission and role in establishing the church. The inclusion of Scriptural references and biblical context adds depth and credibility to the response.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be more explicit in encouraging believers to explore Scripture as part of their faith. While the writer does reference relevant passages, they do not explicitly state how these passages can deepen one's understanding of Jesus' significance or provide a call to action for readers to engage with Scripture. Nevertheless, the overall response is well-written and effectively conveys the importance of Jesus' role as the Cornerstone.\n\nComment: This response is an excellent example of how to thoughtfully explore biblical concepts and their relevance to our faith. The writer's use of Scriptural references and biblical context adds depth and credibility to the response. To take it to the next level, consider explicitly encouraging believers to engage with Scripture and explore its depths in order to deepen their understanding of Jesus' significance."
