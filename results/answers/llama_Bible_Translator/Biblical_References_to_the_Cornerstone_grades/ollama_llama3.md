The concept of Jesus as the Cornerstone is rooted in Psalm 118:22-23, which says:

"The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This came about through the exceeding faithfulness of God; and marvelous are His doings."

This passage is often alluded to or referenced in the New Testament, particularly in Matthew 21:42, Mark 12:10, and Luke 20:17-18. These verses quote Psalm 118:22-23 and apply its message to Jesus Christ.

In these passages, Jesus is identified as the Cornerstone who has been rejected by human beings but has become the foundation of God's new creation. The Cornerstone was a crucial architectural element in ancient times, serving as the central support for a building. In this context, Jesus' role as the Cornerstone conveys several truths about His mission and significance:

1. Rejection by humanity: Just as builders rejected the original cornerstone, many people rejected Jesus during His earthly ministry.
2. God's faithfulness: Despite being rejected, Jesus became the Cornerstone through God's exceeding faithfulness, demonstrating God's sovereignty over human decisions.
3. Foundation for a new creation: As the Cornerstone, Jesus becomes the foundation of God's new creation, which is the church (Ephesians 2:20). This highlights His role in establishing a new community of believers.
4. Salvation and unity: The Cornerstone serves as a unifying force, bringing together people from various backgrounds to form a new whole. In this sense, Jesus' role as the Cornerstone represents His power to bring salvation and unity to humanity.

In summary, the Bible references Jesus as the Cornerstone through quotes of Psalm 118:22-23 in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. This metaphor conveys Jesus' rejection by humanity, God's faithfulness, His foundation for a new creation (the church), and His power to bring salvation and unity.

92.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 92.

This response thoroughly explores the concept of Jesus as the Cornerstone, referencing relevant Scripture passages and elaborating on their meaning. The writer provides a clear and concise explanation of the metaphor, highlighting its significance in understanding Jesus' mission and role in establishing the church. The inclusion of Scriptural references and biblical context adds depth and credibility to the response.

The only area for improvement is that the response could be more explicit in encouraging believers to explore Scripture as part of their faith. While the writer does reference relevant passages, they do not explicitly state how these passages can deepen one's understanding of Jesus' significance or provide a call to action for readers to engage with Scripture. Nevertheless, the overall response is well-written and effectively conveys the importance of Jesus' role as the Cornerstone.

Comment: This response is an excellent example of how to thoughtfully explore biblical concepts and their relevance to our faith. The writer's use of Scriptural references and biblical context adds depth and credibility to the response. To take it to the next level, consider explicitly encouraging believers to engage with Scripture and explore its depths in order to deepen their understanding of Jesus' significance.
