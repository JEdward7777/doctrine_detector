## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Cornerstone.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of Jesus as the Cornerstone is rooted in Psalm 118:22-23, which says:

"The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This came about through the exceeding faithfulness of God; and marvelous are His doings."

This passage is often alluded to or referenced in the New Testament, particularly in Matthew 21:42, Mark 12:10, and Luke 20:17-18. These verses quote Psalm 118:22-23 and apply its message to Jesus Christ.

In these passages, Jesus is identified as the Cornerstone who has been rejected by human beings but has become the foundation of God's new creation. The Cornerstone was a crucial architectural element in ancient times, serving as the central support for a building. In this context, Jesus' role as the Cornerstone conveys several truths about His mission and significance:

1. Rejection by humanity: Just as builders rejected the original cornerstone, many people rejected Jesus during His earthly ministry.
2. God's faithfulness: Despite being rejected, Jesus became the Cornerstone through God's exceeding faithfulness, demonstrating God's sovereignty over human decisions.
3. Foundation for a new creation: As the Cornerstone, Jesus becomes the foundation of God's new creation, which is the church (Ephesians 2:20). This highlights His role in establishing a new community of believers.
4. Salvation and unity: The Cornerstone serves as a unifying force, bringing together people from various backgrounds to form a new whole. In this sense, Jesus' role as the Cornerstone represents His power to bring salvation and unity to humanity.

In summary, the Bible references Jesus as the Cornerstone through quotes of Psalm 118:22-23 in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. This metaphor conveys Jesus' rejection by humanity, God's faithfulness, His foundation for a new creation (the church), and His power to bring salvation and unity.
