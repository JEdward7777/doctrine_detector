  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation and analysis of the concept of Jesus as the Cornerstone, rooted in Scripture and supported by relevant passages. It effectively conveys the significance of Jesus in the foundation of faith and the Church. It encourages believers to explore scripture, deepening their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith. The only slight improvement could be to expand further on the personal application of this understanding for believers in their daily lives. Overall, a strong response with a solid Christian worldview perspective."
