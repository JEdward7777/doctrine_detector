  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively explains the concept of Jesus as the Cornerstone, drawing from relevant biblical passages and highlighting key aspects of His role in the foundation of faith and the Church. The explanation is clear, thorough, and grounded in scriptural references. The response could have further encouraged believers to engage with Scripture for a deeper understanding, but overall, it provides a strong Christian perspective on the significance of Jesus as the Cornerstone."
