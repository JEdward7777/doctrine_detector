  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses reinforcing the idea of God as the 'Most High' and effectively explained what they reveal about His character. The student also touched on important aspects of God's sovereignty, power, wisdom, majesty, and love. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher highlighted verses that more directly address God's eternal nature and authority over all nations and rulers, which could have been integrated into the student's response for a more focused examination of God's sovereignty. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic but could have aligned more closely with the reference answer provided in terms of selecting key verses."
