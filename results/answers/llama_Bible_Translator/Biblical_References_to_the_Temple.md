1. 2 Chronicles 6:8 - This verse says, "Then have the priests, Zadok and his sons, take their stand before the entrance to the Tent of Meeting."

The phrase "Tent of Meeting" is often referred to as the "dwelling place" or "house" of God in the Old Testament. Later, this was replaced by the Temple.

2. 1 Chronicles 22:14 - This verse says, "You will have no fellow in my sight; you will govern all that your eyes see."

3. Isaiah 56:7 - This verse says, "And of foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh, to minister to him and love the name of Yahweh, to be his servants all shall eat at these tables..."

The phrase "these tables" is referring to the altar and other worship spaces within the Temple.

4. Ezekiel 11:20 - This verse says, "You will do as I have done for you, but they will not follow your statutes nor observe your judgments."

This passage is part of Ezekiel's vision of a restored Israelite temple.

5. Malachi 3:1 - This verse says, "See, I am going to send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. And then the Lord you are seeking will suddenly appear at His temple..."

In this passage, God is announcing His return and emphasizing that it will take place in the Temple.

These verses specifically refer to the Temple as the "house of Yahweh," highlighting its importance as a place where God dwelt among His people.
