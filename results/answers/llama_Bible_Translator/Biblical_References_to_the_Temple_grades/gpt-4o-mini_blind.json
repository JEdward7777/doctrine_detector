  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Scriptures and explanations supporting the idea that the Temple in Jerusalem was considered the \"house of Yahweh.\" The references given were appropriate, showcasing the significance of the Temple as God's dwelling place among His people. However, to improve the grade, the student could have included more direct references that explicitly use the phrase \"house of Yahweh\" rather than indirectly referring to the Temple as God's dwelling place. Additionally, a clearer connection between each Scripture and its implications regarding the Temple's identity as the \"house of Yahweh\" would have strengthened the answer."
