  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh,\" which aligns with the concern. However, the student missed referencing the key verses specifically mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. This indicates a partial understanding of the question and the importance of focusing on the specific Scriptures requested."
