  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of Scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh,\" supporting it with relevant verses including 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4. The additional verses provided also effectively demonstrate the importance of the Temple as God's dwelling place among His people. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern with appropriate scriptural references."
