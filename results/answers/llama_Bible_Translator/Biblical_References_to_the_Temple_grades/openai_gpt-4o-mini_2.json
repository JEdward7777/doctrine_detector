  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-explained interpretation of key Scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as God's house, citing relevant verses and explaining their significance. The inclusion of different passages from 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Malachi helps to reinforce the understanding of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh.\" The response successfully addresses the concern by offering a thorough explanation based on biblical references."
