## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "woe" (Greek: οὐαί, Hebrew: הַוּא) appears throughout the Bible, often serving as a warning or an expression of divine displeasure. I'll provide some examples from both Old and New Testaments to shed light on God's judgment.

**Old Testament:**

1. **Prophetic warnings**: In Isaiah 5:8-24, Jesus weeps over Jerusalem, pronouncing seven woes against the city for its idolatry and oppression of the poor (Isaiah 5:7). These woes reveal God's distress at their disobedience.
2. **Against Israel**: Micah 3:1-12 contains seven woes against corrupt leaders in Israel. The prophet denounces their greed, pride, and exploitation of the weak. This passage highlights God's condemnation of injustice within His own people.
3. **Against Nineveh**: Nahum 3:1-19 pronounces three woes against Nineveh, Assyria's capital, for its cruelty and idolatry. These woes serve as a warning to repent before judgment falls.

**New Testament:**

1. **The Sermon on the Mount**: In Matthew 5:13-16, Jesus warns that those who follow Him will be blessed, but those who reject His teachings will suffer seven woes, including being thrown into outer darkness (Matthew 5:22).
2. **Against scribes and Pharisees**: Jesus pronounces five woes against the Pharisees and scribes in Matthew 23:13-36. He condemns their hypocrisy, love of power, and neglect of justice and mercy.
3. **Against the rich**: Luke 6:24-26 records Jesus' teaching about woe to those who are rich, full, and laughing now, but will face God's judgment later.

**What do these examples reveal about God's judgment?**

1. **God is just and holy**: Woes serve as a reminder of God's justice and holiness, emphasizing the importance of living according to His standards.
2. **Condemnation for disobedience**: Woes are often pronounced against those who refuse to repent and follow God's commands, highlighting the consequences of disobedience.
3. **Warning and opportunity for repentance**: Many woes serve as a warning to turn away from sin and seek God's mercy, giving people an opportunity to change their ways before judgment falls.
4. **God is not pleased with injustice**: The Bible consistently portrays God as deeply concerned about injustice, oppression, and idolatry. Woes are a manifestation of His displeasure with these sins.

In conclusion, the term "woe" in the Bible serves as a reminder of God's justice, holiness, and displeasure with sin. It highlights the importance of repentance and living according to God's standards, while also emphasizing the consequences of disobedience and rejection of His teachings.
