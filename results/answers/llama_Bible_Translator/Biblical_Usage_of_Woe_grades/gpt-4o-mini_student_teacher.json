  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with relevant examples from both the Old and New Testaments to illustrate the concept of \"woe\" in relation to God's judgment. They highlighted the seriousness of divine judgment and the consequences of disobedience, as well as the opportunity for repentance. The analysis of the examples and their implications for understanding God's justice, holiness, and displeasure with sin was well done. The student effectively addressed the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment through scripture. However, the answer could have been strengthened by including additional examples such as Ezekiel 13:17-18, Habakkuk 2:12, and Matthew 23:23 to further solidify their argument."
