  "grade_comment": "Grade: 94\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-supported analysis of the term \"woe\" in the Bible, connecting it to examples from the Old and New Testaments to illustrate God's judgment. The incorporation of scriptural references and theological insights from a Christian worldview effectively addresses the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed in the Bible. This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively conveys the Christian perspective on God's justice and holiness."
