## Question [Building Materials](../../../questions/Building_Materials.md)
What materials were commonly used to construct altars during biblical times?

## Correct Answer
Altars were often made from packed dirt or large stones. Some special altars were constructed from wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze.

## Stated Concern
Knowing the materials and structure of altars can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship.

## [Answer](../Building_Materials.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the biblical period, altars were typically constructed using natural stone and wood. Here's a breakdown of the common materials used:

1. Stone: Granite, basalt, limestone, and other types of stone were widely used for building altars. The Israelites often used unhewn stones (Exodus 20:25), which meant that the stones weren't smoothed or polished.
2. Wood: Wooden altars were also common, particularly in the earliest periods of biblical history. Cedar, cypress, and acacia trees were popular choices due to their durability and resistance to rot.
3. Earth: In some cases, altars might have been constructed using earth or soil, such as the altar at Gilgal (Joshua 4:20) or the altar in Joshua's camp (Joshua 8:30-31). This material choice could symbolize a connection with the earth and God.
4. Earthware: In some instances, altars might have been built using earthen vessels or ceramics. For example, the prophet Jeremiah speaks of an "altar made of clay" (Jeremiah 19:13).
5. Metal: While not as common as stone or wood, metal was occasionally used for altar construction. The Israelites would sometimes use bronze or copper to create sacrificial vessels or altars.

It's worth noting that the primary focus during biblical times wasn't on creating elaborate or ornate structures but rather on providing a simple, functional space for worship and sacrifice.
