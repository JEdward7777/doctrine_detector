  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive breakdown of the common materials used in constructing biblical altars, along with scriptural references to support the content. The additional details on the significance of each material add depth to the understanding of the role and symbolism of altars in biblical practices. However, it could have further elaborated on the significance of wood overlaid with metals on special altars, as mentioned in the provided answer, to fully address the concern. Overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview by connecting the materials used in altar construction with biblical practices and reverence in worship."
