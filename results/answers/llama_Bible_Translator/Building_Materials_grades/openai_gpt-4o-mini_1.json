The mention of metal overlays like gold, brass, or bronze on wood altars adds to the understanding of the altar's significance in worship. While the focus on the simplicity and functionality of altars is mentioned, a deeper reflection on the spiritual symbolism and significance of altar materials could further enhance a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and reverence in worship."
