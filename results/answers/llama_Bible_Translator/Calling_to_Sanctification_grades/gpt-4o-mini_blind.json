The references to 2 Corinthians 7:1, 1 John 3:2-3, 1 Peter 1:13-16, and Romans 12:1-2 are relevant and help support the discussion. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of personal sanctification in the Christian walk. One suggestion for improvement would be to provide more explanation or application of the verses cited to further enhance the depth of the response."
