  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer citing relevant Bible verses and explaining the commands related to personal sanctification. However, the student's answer lacked direct specificity in addressing the concern of emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process. The student could have further highlighted the individual believer's role and accountability in actively pursuing sanctification through personal choices and actions."
