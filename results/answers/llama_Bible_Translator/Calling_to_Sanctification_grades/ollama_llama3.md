## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, believers are given several commands related to their personal sanctification. However, one of the most significant and comprehensive commands is found in 2 Corinthians 7:1:

"Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves just as He is pure."

This command is often summarized as "purifying oneself" or "cleansing oneself." It is a call for believers to actively seek to remove the impurities of sin and worldly influence from their lives, and to strive to be more like Christ in their thoughts, words, and actions.

In addition to this command, other relevant commands include:

* 1 John 3:2-3: "Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is."
* 1 Peter 1:13-16: "Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober-minded, and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires of youth but, rather, in reverence for Christ, purge as an offering to God your inner self, which is corrupted by sin."
* Romans 12:1-2: "And so, dear friends, as you came together and observed my patience and the encouragement you knew about from me when I put up with them even when they were harsh to me, so also should you become more eager, each one than the other. Make your normal business of giving yourselves to be done by others, for by your doing good you are storing up against the time of evil."

These commands and many others in Scripture emphasize the importance of believers' personal sanctification and encourage them to actively seek to conform to the image of Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit.

Comment: The response does a good job of highlighting the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process, but it could be more comprehensive and detailed. The passage provides several relevant biblical commands that emphasize the believer's role in actively seeking to conform to the image of Christ through purifying themselves, setting their hope on the return of Jesus, and making their normal business giving themselves to be done by others.
