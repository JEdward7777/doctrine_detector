  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus, addressing both faith and authority effectively. The student's response included relevant scriptural references and implications for understanding faith and authority in the context of Jesus' ministry. However, the student could improve their grade by focusing more closely on directly answering the specific concern provided and by aligning their insights more closely with the reference answer, emphasizing the centurion's faith in Jesus' authority to heal."
