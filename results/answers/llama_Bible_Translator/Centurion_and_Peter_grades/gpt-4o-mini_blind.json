The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications of this event, emphasizing the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan of salvation, the breaking of cultural barriers, and the growth of the early Church. The analysis is well-supported with scriptural references and doctrinal soundness. Great job overall!"
