  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of the centurion's declaration in recognizing Jesus' divinity and sovereignty. It accurately highlights the implications of Jesus' crucifixion, including the universality of his message, the validation of his claims, and the proof of his sacrifice. The writer also effectively shows how this event illustrates God's sovereignty over all things. The only area for improvement is that some of the points could be further developed or supported with biblical evidence. Overall, a well-written response that demonstrates a good grasp of the concern.\n\nNote: I deducted 8 points because the response could have been more detailed and supported with Scripture, but it still shows a strong understanding of the topic and addresses the concern effectively."
