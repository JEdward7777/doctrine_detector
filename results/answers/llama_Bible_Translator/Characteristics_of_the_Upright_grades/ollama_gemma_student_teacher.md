In the biblical context, an "upright" person (Hebrew: יָשָׁר, yāšār) is someone who lives a virtuous and morally good life. The term "upright" connotes integrity, honesty, fairness, and moral rectitude. Here are some key qualities that define an upright person in the biblical context:

1. Moral purity: An upright person is free from guilt, shame, and moral defilement (Proverbs 20:7; Job 28:28).
2. Righteousness: They live according to God's righteous standards, demonstrating justice, mercy, and compassion (Psalm 119:137; Isaiah 1:17).
3. Honesty: Upright people speak truthfully and are free from deception, flattery, or manipulation (Proverbs 12:22; Ephesians 4:25).
4. Integrity: They maintain a consistent moral character, unswayed by external pressures or temptations (Proverbs 11:3; Psalm 15:2).
5. Fairness: Upright individuals are just and fair in their dealings with others, treating all people equally under the law (Deuteronomy 16:20; Leviticus 19:15).
6. Humility: They recognize their limitations, depend on God, and avoid arrogance or pride (Proverbs 3:34; James 4:10).
7. Wisdom: Upright people seek wisdom from above and demonstrate prudence in their decisions and actions (Proverbs 9:10; James 1:5-8).
8. Love for others: They show compassion, kindness, and love to their neighbors and fellow human beings (Leviticus 19:18; Deuteronomy 6:18).

In the biblical context, being an upright person is not a natural or automatic state but rather a conscious choice that requires discipline, self-control, and dependence on God. As Jesus taught, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled" (Matthew 5:6).
