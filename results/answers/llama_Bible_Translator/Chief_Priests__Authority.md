## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the chief priests (Hebrew: כהנים הראשונים, kohanim haroshonim) held a higher level of authority and responsibility compared to the ordinary priests (Hebrew: כהנים, kohanim). The chief priests were part of the Sanhedrin, the highest Jewish council that governed Jerusalem and administered temple affairs.

The chief priests had several key responsibilities:

1. Oversight: They supervised the daily operations of the Temple, including the worship services, sacrifices, and offerings.
2. Priestly duties: As high-ranking priests, they performed specific priestly duties, such as offering sacrifices, handling sacred objects, and conducting rituals.
3. Spiritual guidance: They served as spiritual leaders, providing guidance on matters of faith and morality to the people.
4. Administrative roles: They managed the Temple's finances, staff, and facilities.

In contrast, ordinary priests (kohanim) were responsible for various tasks within the Temple complex:

1. Ritual duties: They performed specific priestly duties, such as offering sacrifices, handling sacred objects, and conducting rituals.
2. Temple maintenance: They maintained the cleanliness and upkeep of the Temple complex.
3. Spiritual support: They provided spiritual support to the people by officiating at worship services, performing blessings, and offering counsel.

While ordinary priests held important roles within the Temple, their authority was not on the same level as that of the chief priests. The chief priests served as the primary leaders and decision-makers in temple affairs, with the ordinary priests functioning under their guidance and supervision.

It's worth noting that this distinction is also reflected in Jesus' interactions with the two types of priests. In the New Testament, Jesus often confronts the chief priests and scribes (experts in Jewish law) for their spiritual and moral failures, whereas he seems to have a more nuanced relationship with ordinary priests like Zachariah (Luke 1:5-23).
