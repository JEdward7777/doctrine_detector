## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible provides clear instructions on how children should honor their parents. In the book of Ephesians, chapter 6, verse 1-3, it says:

"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise; That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth."

In this passage, children are instructed to "obey" their parents, which implies submission and obedience. Additionally, they are commanded to "honor" their father and mother.

The phrase "first commandment with promise" indicates that honoring one's parents is a vital part of living a life pleasing to God. In fact, it says that if children obey and honor their parents, "it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth." This suggests that honoring one's parents has positive consequences for one's life.

In other words, the Bible teaches that children should:

1. Obey their parents: Children are to submit to their parents' guidance and authority.
2. Honor their parents: Children are to show respect, gratitude, and deference towards their parents.

This instruction is not limited to biological parents; it also applies to those who have taken on a parental role in a child's life, such as foster parents or spiritual mentors.

It's worth noting that this commandment is often seen as the fifth of the Ten Commandments, which are summarized by Jesus Christ himself: "Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart; you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk about them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise." (Deuteronomy 6:4-7)

In this context, honoring one's parents is seen as an integral part of loving and serving God.
