What a great question!

The term "Christ" (Greek: Χριστός, Christos) has indeed undergone significant development and evolution throughout the New Testament. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Original Meaning**: In the Gospels, particularly in Matthew and Mark, Jesus is often referred to as "the Messiah" or "the Anointed One" (e.g., Matt 16:16; Mark 8:29). This term emphasizes Jesus' role as the long-awaited savior of Israel, foretold by Old Testament prophets like Isaiah and Daniel. The Greek word "Christos" (Christ) is simply a translation of the Hebrew title Messiah.
2. **Association with Joshua**: In the New Testament, particularly in Luke's Gospel, Jesus is sometimes referred to as "the Christ" or "the Son of David" (e.g., Luke 1:32; 3:15). This emphasis highlights Jesus' connection to the Old Testament figure of Joshua/Jesus, who led Israel into the Promised Land. This association underscores Jesus' role as a liberator and savior.
3. **Redemptive Focus**: As the apostles began to proclaim the good news about Jesus, they started using "Christ" (or "the Christ") more frequently to emphasize his redemptive work. For example, in 1 Corinthians 1:30-31, Paul writes that "Christ Jesus became for us wisdom from God... and he is our righteousness." Here, Christ refers to Jesus' role as the One who brings salvation and justification.
4. **Divine Title**: As the early Christian communities developed, "Christ" began to take on a more divine connotation. In Colossians 1:15-20, for instance, Paul affirms that Jesus is the image of God, the firstborn of all creation, and through whom all things were created. This passage highlights Christ's divinity and his role as the source of salvation.
5. **Theological Summarization**: Finally, in the later epistles (e.g., Ephesians, Colossians, and Philippians), "Christ" becomes a summary title that encompasses Jesus' entire salvific work. Paul uses this term to encapsulate Jesus' redemptive achievements: his life, death, resurrection, and exaltation.

Throughout the New Testament, then, the term "Christ" evolves from emphasizing Jesus' role as the Messiah (Old Testament expectation) to highlighting his divine nature and salvific work (early Christian proclamation). By the time of the later epistles, Christ has become a comprehensive title that summarizes the entire gospel message.
