The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively explains the development of the term. However, the student's answer could deepen the focus on recognizing the significance of the title 'Christ' in deepening understanding of Jesus's identity and purpose, as outlined in the specific concern. Therefore, there is room for improvement in relating the evolution of the term 'Christ' to the deeper understanding of Jesus's identity and purpose within a Christian worldview."
