  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the term \"Christ\" in the New Testament, demonstrating an understanding of its progression from a title to an expression of Jesus' divine nature and salvific work. The discussion effectively deepens the understanding of Jesus's identity and purpose by tracing the significance of the title 'Christ' throughout different stages in the New Testament. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the information presented in the overview to the significance of the title 'Christ' in clarifying Jesus's identity and purpose in a more direct manner."
