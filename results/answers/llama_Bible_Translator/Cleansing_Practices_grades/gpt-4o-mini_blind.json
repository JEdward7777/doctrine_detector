The student effectively links Old Testament principles to contemporary Christian living, emphasizing the importance of spiritual cleanliness, consecration, and separation from unclean practices. The strong connection to Jesus' ultimate sacrifice for purification is commendable. One area for improvement could be expounding more on the importance of Christ as the fulfillment of the Old Testament rituals, emphasizing His role in spiritual cleansing. Overall, a solid response that demonstrates a good understanding of integrating Old Testament principles into modern Christian practices."
