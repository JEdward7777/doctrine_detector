  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student effectively captured various ways modern Christians can reflect the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness in contemporary faith practice. They provided a comprehensive list of practices with clear explanations and connected them back to biblical principles. Additionally, the student emphasized the importance of not viewing these practices as a means to earn salvation but rather as expressions of devotion and dependence on Jesus Christ. While the student went beyond the given reference answer, their response demonstrated a strong understanding and application of biblical teachings."
