  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 70. \n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of what having a clear conscience means in the context of Christian teachings, they focus more on the process and elements of maintaining a clear conscience rather than emphasizing the core aspect of not hiding sin and being in obedience to God. The student could strengthen their response by clearly connecting each point back to the central idea of obedience to God and avoiding sin. Additionally, while the student references biblical teachings and provides practical suggestions, a deeper integration of Scripture and a more explicit emphasis on the importance of maintaining a clear conscience for spiritual health and alignment with God's will would enhance the response."
