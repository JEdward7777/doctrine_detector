  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and insightful exploration of the metaphor of humans as sheep in biblical teaching. The student effectively covers key aspects such as vulnerability, dependence, helplessness, flock mentality, protection, and restoration. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references enhances the explanation. The seamless integration of the role of Jesus Christ as the Good Shepherd and the ultimate fulfillment of this metaphor is doctrinally sound and reinforces the Christian worldview. Overall, a well-written and thorough analysis deserving of a high grade."
