  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the comparison between humans and sheep in the Bible, emphasizing vulnerability, dependence, and the need for divine guidance. They effectively connected key aspects of the analogy to humanity's relationship with God. However, the answer could have been strengthened by focusing more directly on the central theme of humans being easily led astray and in need of protection, as indicated in the reference answer from the teacher. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the biblical metaphor and its implications."
