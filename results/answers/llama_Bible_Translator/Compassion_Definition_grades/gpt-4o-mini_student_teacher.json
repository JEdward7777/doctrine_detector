  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer on the biblical definition of compassion and the associated actions. They covered various aspects such as empathy, sympathetic love, altruism, and specific actions like showing mercy, caring for the vulnerable, visiting the afflicted, helping those in need, and forgiving. The answer demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical perspective on compassion and how it should guide our actions towards others. However, the answer could have been more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
