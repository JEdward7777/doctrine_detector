  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided detailed examples of compassion from the Bible and discussed their significance well, they could have focused more on the practical applications of compassion in real-life situations, as the concern specified. The examples chosen, such as Jesus, Mary, the Good Samaritan, Rahab, and the Israelites during the Exodus, effectively showcase compassion, but the response could have tied these examples to real-life scenarios or offered insights on how individuals today can model similar behavior in their own lives. Emphasizing the practical aspects of compassion as demonstrated by biblical figures would have strengthened the response and better addressed the specified concern."
