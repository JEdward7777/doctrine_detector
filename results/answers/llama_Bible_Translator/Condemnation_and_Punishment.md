What a great question!

The teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 are crucial for understanding God's character and His approach to punishment. Let's dive into these passages:

Matthew 12:7 (quoting Hosea 11:9): "If you had learned to be pleased with reproof, your ear would not have been calloused. For the bed is too short by half a cubit, and the blanket too narrow for you."

This passage highlights God's desire for His people to respond positively to correction and rebuke. It emphasizes that true learning and growth come from embracing constructive criticism, rather than rejecting it. In this context, punishment or reproof is not intended as condemnation but as an opportunity for spiritual growth.

Psalm 34:22: "David says, 'Do not be far from me, for trouble has reached my bed.'" Here, King David is seeking God's presence and help in the midst of his troubles. This psalm highlights the importance of seeking God in times of need, rather than turning away from Him.

In both passages, we see that punishment or reproof is not about condemning others but about drawing them closer to God. These teachings shape our perspective on punishment as a form of:

1. Correction: Punishment is meant to correct and rebuke us, not condemn us. It's an opportunity for growth and spiritual maturity.
2. Confrontation with sin: Punishment can be seen as a means of confronting and dealing with our sinful nature, rather than condoning or ignoring it.
3. Invitation to seek God: Both passages emphasize the importance of seeking God in times of need, which encourages us to turn to Him for help and guidance.

In light of these teachings, we should view punishment not as a form of condemnation but as an opportunity to:

* Respond positively to correction and rebuke
* Seek God's presence and help in times of need
* Confront and deal with our sinful nature
* Experience spiritual growth and maturity

By considering these passages, we can gain a deeper understanding of God's character and His approach to punishment, which should lead us to a more compassionate and merciful attitude towards others.
