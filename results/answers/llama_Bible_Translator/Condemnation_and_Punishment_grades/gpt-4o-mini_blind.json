  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 and attempts to connect them to the perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation. The explanation of punishment as correction, confrontation with sin, and an invitation to seek God is well articulated. However, there are a few areas where the explanation could be strengthened with more scriptural analysis and a deeper exploration of the concept of condemnation in the context of these passages. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer link between the teachings and the overarching theme of punishment as a form of condemnation. Overall, a solid attempt but could be improved with more depth and clarity."
