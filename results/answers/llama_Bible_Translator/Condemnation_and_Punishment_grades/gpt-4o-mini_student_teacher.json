  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough examination of the passages in Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22, demonstrating a good understanding of how punishment is viewed in a Christian context. The connections made towards correction, growth, seeking God, and confronting sin are well articulated. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by directly tying in the concepts of divine justice and mercy as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. Emphasizing the importance of balancing divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment would have enhanced the overall response."
