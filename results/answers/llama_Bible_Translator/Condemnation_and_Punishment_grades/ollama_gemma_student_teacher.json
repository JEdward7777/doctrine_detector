  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 95/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical passages and their relevance to the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. The student clearly articulates the idea that punishment is not primarily about condemnation but about correction, confrontation of sin, and an invitation to seek God. The response also acknowledges the importance of mercy and forgiveness, which aligns with the Christian worldview."
