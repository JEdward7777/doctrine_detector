  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical passages provided, highlighting God's desire for correction, confrontation with sin, and invitation to seek Him in times of need. The writer effectively applies these teachings to our perspective on punishment, emphasizing its corrective and confrontational aspects.\n\nHowever, while the response touches on the theme of mercy, it could be more explicitly developed. The concern about balancing divine justice and mercy is somewhat addressed through the discussion of correction and rebuke, but a more direct exploration of how God's character reflects both justice and mercy would strengthen the argument.\n\nThe writer also presents a clear and logical structure, using biblical passages to support their claims. The inclusion of application points at the end adds practical value to the response, encouraging readers to view punishment in a more positive light.\n\nOverall, while the response could be improved by more explicitly exploring the theme of mercy, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical teachings and provides a clear and logical structure for discussing punishment."
