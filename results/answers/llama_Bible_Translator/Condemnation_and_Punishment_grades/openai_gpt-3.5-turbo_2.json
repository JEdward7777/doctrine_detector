  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively incorporates the teachings from Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 to address the concern about balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. The student accurately explains how punishment is intended for correction and spiritual growth rather than condemnation, aligning with the Christian worldview. The application of seeking God's presence in times of trouble and confronting sinful nature adds depth to the response. However, a more explicit connection to the concept of mercy over sacrifice in the provided answer would have strengthened the response further."
