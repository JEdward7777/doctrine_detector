It highlights the importance of viewing punishment as a means of spiritual growth and drawing closer to God. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the balance between divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment. More exploration of how God's justice and mercy intersect in the concept of punishment would enhance the depth of the response."
