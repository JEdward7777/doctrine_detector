  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the passages in Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22, demonstrating an understanding of how divine justice and mercy intersect in the context of punishment. The student effectively balances the importance of correction and rebuke with the need for seeking God's presence and guidance in times of trouble. The explanation of punishment as a means of confronting sin and promoting spiritual growth aligns well with a Christian worldview. The response could be further strengthened by incorporating specific examples of how God's mercy and justice are manifested in the context of punishment."
