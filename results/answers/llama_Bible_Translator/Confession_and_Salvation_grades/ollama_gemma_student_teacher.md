## [Answer](../Confession_and_Salvation.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In Paul's writings, particularly in Romans 10:9-13 and Philippians 2:9-11, the confession "Jesus is Lord" (Greek: ὁ Κύριος Ἰησοῦς, ho Kyrios Iēsous) is closely tied to salvation. According to Paul, confessing Jesus as Lord is a crucial aspect of being saved.

In Romans 10:9-13, Paul writes:

"If you declare with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with the heart that one believes resulting in righteousness, and it is with the mouth that one confesses resulting in salvation."

Here, Paul emphasizes that both believing in one's heart (πίστις, pistis) and confessing with one's mouth (ὁμολογία, homologia) are essential for being saved. The confession "Jesus is Lord" is not just a verbal formula, but an expression of genuine faith. When we confess Jesus as Lord, we acknowledge His divine authority over our lives, which is a fundamental aspect of Christian faith.

In Philippians 2:9-11, Paul writes:

"Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every other name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

Here, Paul highlights the universal recognition of Jesus' lordship, which will be manifested when all creation acknowledges His supreme authority. For Paul, this confession is not just a human declaration, but an acknowledgment of God's revelation of Jesus as the Messiah and Savior.

In both passages, Paul suggests that confessing Jesus as Lord is a fundamental expression of faith, which is closely tied to salvation. When we genuinely acknowledge Jesus' lordship, we demonstrate our trust in His divine authority and our surrender to His will. This confession, combined with genuine faith, leads to salvation (Romans 10:9-13) and acknowledges God's revelation of Jesus Christ as Lord (Philippians 2:9-11).

Therefore, according to Paul's writings, confessing that Jesus is Lord is an essential aspect of being saved, as it expresses our trust in His divine authority and surrender to His will.
