  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-articulated explanation of the biblical definition of conscience and how it functions according to Christian beliefs. They have effectively connected conscience to the concept of God's law written on our hearts and the role it plays in moral decision-making. The answer incorporates relevant biblical references and theological concepts, which demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. However, the response could have been improved by directly focusing on the given reference answer and presenting a more concise comparison or expansion upon it."
