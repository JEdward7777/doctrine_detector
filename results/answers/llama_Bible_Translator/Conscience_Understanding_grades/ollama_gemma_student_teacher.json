  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical definition and function of conscience within Christian beliefs. The response clearly articulates the theological concepts of \"levav\" and \"syneidesis,\" along with their relevance to the moral sense. The inclusion of references to Romans 2:14-15 and other relevant passages adds depth and credibility to the explanation. The student also acknowledges the potential for a seared conscience due to sin and emphasizes the importance of regeneration and the Holy Spirit in restoring it."
