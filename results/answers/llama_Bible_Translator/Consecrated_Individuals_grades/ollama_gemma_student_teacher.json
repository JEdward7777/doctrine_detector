  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of consecration to God in the Bible. They provide detailed examples of individuals who voluntarily consecrated themselves to serve and worship the Lord. The inclusion of the concept of God's \"call\" or \"consecration\" adds depth to the response. While the reference answer focuses on specific groups rather than individuals, the student's answer goes beyond the provided criteria and offers a more comprehensive analysis."
