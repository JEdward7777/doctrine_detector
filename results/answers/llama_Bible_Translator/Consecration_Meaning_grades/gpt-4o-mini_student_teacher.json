  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and insightful answer that demonstrates a strong understanding of consecration in a Christian context. They have incorporated relevant biblical references and examples to support their explanation. However, the student's response could be improved by aligning more closely with the reference answer, which succinctly states that consecration is about dedicating something or someone to serve God and make them holy and set apart for His service. The student's answer expands on this definition effectively but could benefit from being more concise in certain sections. Overall, a well-written and informed response."
