It also effectively connects these concepts to the process of preparing individuals or things for God's service. While it does not explicitly address the concern about the purification process, it provides sufficient context and biblical references (Leviticus 8:6-12) that demonstrate an understanding of this aspect of consecration.\n\nThe response could have received a perfect score if it had directly addressed the concern about the purification process or provided more explicit examples or illustrations to further clarify this concept. Nevertheless, its overall coverage and biblical grounding make it a strong response."
