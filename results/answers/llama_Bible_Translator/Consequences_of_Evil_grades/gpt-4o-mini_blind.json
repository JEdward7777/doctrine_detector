The student effectively highlights key passages from both the Old and New Testaments and connects them to the broader theme of God's justice and holiness. The inclusion of specific examples and contexts enhances the understanding of how evil leads to various repercussions at different levels. The emphasis on repentance and the necessity of a personal relationship with God for redemption is also appropriately emphasized. Great job overall!"
