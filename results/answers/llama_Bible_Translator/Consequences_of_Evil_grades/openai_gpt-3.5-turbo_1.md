# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The consequences of evil are a crucial theme throughout Scripture, serving as a warning to humanity and highlighting God's justice and holiness.

In various biblical passages, we see the consequences of evil unfold:

1. Genesis 3:16-19 - As a direct result of Adam and Eve's disobedience, sin enters the world, and humanity is cursed with hard labor, childbirth pain, and conflict between the sexes. This passage illustrates how sin's consequences affect not only individuals but also relationships and creation itself.

2. Exodus 20:5 - The Lord warns that if His people break their covenant with Him, they will be punished with a severe plague or even destruction (Exodus 32:9-10).

3. Leviticus 26:14-17, 30-33 - God threatens to punish Israel for disobedience by destroying their crops, livestock, and cities; He also promises exile if His people refuse to listen.

4. Isaiah 5:2-7 - Yahweh denounces Judah's wickedness and says that they will be punished with judgment, shame, and desolation (Isaiah 24:1-3).

5. Jeremiah 9:2-3, 15-16 - The prophet warns of the consequences of rejecting God: He will destroy Jerusalem and the Temple, scattering His people.

6. Matthew 25:31-46 - Jesus teaches that those who have not shown love to others (the least of these) will be punished with eternal separation from God, while those who have shown mercy will inherit eternal life (Matthew 25:34).

7. Revelation 20:11-15 - The book of Revelation portrays a future judgment where those who have rejected God's offer of salvation through Jesus Christ will suffer the consequences of their evil deeds, including death and destruction.

These biblical references illustrate the far-reaching consequences of evil, which can affect individuals, communities, nations, and even creation. Ultimately, they point to the need for repentance and a personal relationship with the one true God, who is just and holy but also loving and merciful towards those who turn away from their sin and seek Him.
