  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and well-supported explanation of what the Bible says about pride and humility. The student effectively references key verses and examples from scripture to illustrate the consequences of pride and the importance of humility. The inclusion of both Old Testament and New Testament passages enhances the depth of the answer. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to integrate more personal reflection or application to the reader's own life to make the message more relatable. Overall, well done."
