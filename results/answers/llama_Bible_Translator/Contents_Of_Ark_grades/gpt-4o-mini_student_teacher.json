They also effectively connected the items to the broader theme of God's covenant with the Israelites and the significance of the Ark in Israel's worship. The student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively conveys the spiritual importance of the Ark in relation to God's presence and provision. Great job!"
