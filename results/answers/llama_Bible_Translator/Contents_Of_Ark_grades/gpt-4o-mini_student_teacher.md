## [Answer](../Contents_Of_Ark.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the biblical account in Exodus 25-31 and Hebrews 9:1-5, the Ark of the Covenant contained three main items:

1. The Tablets of the Law (Exodus 25:16; Deuteronomy 10:2): These were two stone tablets written by God's own hand, containing the Ten Commandments given to Moses on Mount Sinai.
2. Aaron's Rod that Budded (Hebrews 9:4): This was a rod belonging to Aaron, the first high priest of Israel, which miraculously budded and produced almonds, signifying God's choice of Aaron as his appointed leader.
3. A Pot of Manna (Exodus 16:32-34; Hebrews 9:4): This was the same miraculous bread that had sustained the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings. The manna was stored in a pot and placed within the Ark to remind the people of God's provision and care.

These three items were placed inside the Ark, which was overlaid with gold (Exodus 25:11) and covered by the Mercy Seat (also called the Covering or Propitiatory), made of pure gold. The Ark itself was constructed from acacia wood and was approximately 3.5 feet long, 2.25 feet wide, and 1.75 feet high.

The Ark played a crucial role in Israel's worship and was considered the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. It served as a symbol of God's covenant with Israel and reminded them of their dependence on Him for provision, guidance, and redemption.
