  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided an elaborate and thorough answer with scriptural references and practical steps for Christians to identify corrupt influences in the world. However, the response may have focused more on specific manifestations of corrupt influences rather than centering on behaviors and attitudes that contradict biblical teachings and promote selfishness and sin, as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
