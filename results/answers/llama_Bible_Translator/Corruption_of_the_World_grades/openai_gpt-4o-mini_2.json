It aligns well with the concern of remaining vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living. The incorporation of relevant Bible verses adds depth and clarity to the response, offering a strong Christian worldview perspective. Great job in addressing the concern with a thorough and scripturally-based approach."
