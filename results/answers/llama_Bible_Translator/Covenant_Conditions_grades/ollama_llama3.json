  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nThis response demonstrates a clear understanding of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, providing specific examples from Genesis to the New Testament. The writer effectively highlights the differences between these two types of covenants, explaining that while some require human obedience (conditional), others are based on God's initiative and promise (unconditional).\n\nThe response is well-organized, with clear headings and bullet points that make it easy to follow along. The examples provided are relevant and accurate, showing a strong understanding of the biblical context.\n\nOne area for improvement could be the addition of more detail or analysis in certain sections. For instance, while the writer does a good job explaining the conditional nature of the Mosaic Covenant, they could delve deeper into why God established this covenant with Israel in the first place and how it relates to the broader story of redemption.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants, earning a grade of 90."
