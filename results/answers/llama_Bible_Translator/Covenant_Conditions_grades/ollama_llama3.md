## Question [Covenant Conditions](../../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)
What are some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible?

## Correct Answer
An example of an unconditional covenant is God's promise to never destroy the earth again with a flood. In contrast, conditional covenants require obedience from the people, such as the covenant at Sinai where God said, 'If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant...'

## Stated Concern
Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

## [Answer](../Covenant_Conditions.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, we see both conditional and unconditional covenants between God and humanity.

**Conditional Covenants:**

1. **The Covenant with Noah (Genesis 9:8-17)**: This covenant is conditional because it requires humans to refrain from shedding human blood or eating flesh with its life still in it. If they kept these commands, God would maintain the rainbow as a sign of His promise not to destroy the earth by flood again.
2. **The Covenant with Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3, 17:1-27)**: While this covenant is often seen as unconditional, it does contain conditional elements. For example, if Abraham and his descendants failed to obey God's commands, they would be cursed (Genesis 17:14). However, the overall tone of this covenant is one of promise and blessing.
3. **The Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19-24)**: This covenant is conditional because it requires Israel to obey God's laws and commandments in order to remain in the land and enjoy His blessings.

**Unconditional Covenants:**

1. **The Covenant with Noah (Genesis 9:8-17)**: While there are some conditional elements to this covenant, the overall promise of a rainbow and a preserved earth is unconditional.
2. **The Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7:4-17, Psalm 89:20-37)**: This covenant promises that God will establish a Messiah from David's lineage, regardless of Israel's obedience or disobedience. The Messiah would bring redemption to the world, and this promise is considered unconditional.
3. **The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34, Hebrews 8:6-13)**: This covenant is based on God's grace and mercy, rather than human works. It promises eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ, regardless of one's background or performance.

In summary, while some covenants in the Bible contain conditional elements, others are considered unconditional, meaning that they are based on God's initiative and promise, rather than human response.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 90

This response demonstrates a clear understanding of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, providing specific examples from Genesis to the New Testament. The writer effectively highlights the differences between these two types of covenants, explaining that while some require human obedience (conditional), others are based on God's initiative and promise (unconditional).

The response is well-organized, with clear headings and bullet points that make it easy to follow along. The examples provided are relevant and accurate, showing a strong understanding of the biblical context.

One area for improvement could be the addition of more detail or analysis in certain sections. For instance, while the writer does a good job explaining the conditional nature of the Mosaic Covenant, they could delve deeper into why God established this covenant with Israel in the first place and how it relates to the broader story of redemption.

Overall, however, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants, earning a grade of 90.
