  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, illustrating a strong understanding of the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants from a Christian worldview. The mention of specific Biblical examples and their conditions or lack thereof further supports the analysis. The only minor improvement would be to expand on how God's grace and mercy play a role in both types of covenants, linking it more explicitly to the Christian understanding of salvation."
