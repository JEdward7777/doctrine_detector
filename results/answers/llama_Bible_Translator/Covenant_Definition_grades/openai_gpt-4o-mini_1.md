## [Answer](../Covenant_Definition.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, a covenant is a sacred agreement or promise between two parties, typically God and humanity (or Israel). The concept of covenant appears throughout Scripture, but its core meaning can be summarized as follows:

A biblical covenant is a bilateral agreement where one party (usually God) makes a unilateral commitment to the other party. This means that God initiates the covenant and makes promises to perform specific actions, while the human party agrees to fulfill certain obligations.

In a covenant relationship, both parties are bound by their commitments. If one party fails to uphold their end of the agreement, it is considered a breach of the covenant. However, when both parties keep their promises, the covenant is said to be "fulfilled" or "confirmed."

Some key characteristics of biblical covenants include:

1. Unilateral initiation: God initiates the covenant, and the human party responds with trust and obedience.
2. Promises: The initiating party (usually God) makes specific promises to perform certain actions.
3. Obligations: The responding party agrees to fulfill certain obligations or duties.
4. Mutual commitment: Both parties are committed to upholding their end of the agreement.
5. Fulfillment/Confirmation: When both parties keep their promises, the covenant is considered fulfilled or confirmed.

The biblical covenants can be categorized into three main types:

1. Adamic Covenant (Genesis 2:17): A covenant between God and Adam, where God gives humanity the responsibility to care for creation and warns them of the consequences of disobedience.
2. Noahic Covenant (Genesis 9:8-17): A covenant between God and Noah after the flood, where God makes a promise never again to destroy all living creatures by a flood.
3. Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12:1-3, 15:1-21, 17:1-27): A covenant between God and Abraham, where God promises to make Abram's descendants a blessing to all nations and gives him the land of Canaan as an inheritance.

These covenants are significant because they establish the foundation for God's relationship with humanity and outline His plans for redemption.
