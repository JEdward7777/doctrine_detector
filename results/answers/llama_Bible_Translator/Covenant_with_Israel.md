## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The covenant between God and the people of Israel, also known as the Mosaic Covenant or the Old Covenant, is a crucial aspect of biblical theology.

In Exodus 19-24, Leviticus 26, and Deuteronomy 27-30, we see that this covenant was a conditional agreement between Yahweh, the God of Israel, and the Israelites. The covenant was based on a mutual promise: God would be their God, and they would be His people (Exodus 6:7).

The terms of the covenant can be summarized as follows:

1. God's promises: God promised to:
	* Deliver the Israelites from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 3:7-10).
	* Give them the land of Canaan as an inheritance (Exodus 19:5-6, Leviticus 25:38).
	* Be their God and provide for their needs (Leviticus 26:4-13).
2. Israel's responsibilities: The Israelites agreed to:
	* Obey God's laws and commands (Exodus 19:8, Deuteronomy 11:18).
	* Keep the Sabbath day holy (Exodus 20:8-11, Leviticus 23:3).
	* Set apart a tithe (10%) of their crops for the priests and Levites (Leviticus 27:30-33).

The covenant was conditional, meaning that if the Israelites kept God's commands and laws, He would fulfill His promises to them. However, if they disobeyed or broke the covenant, God would withdraw His blessings and even bring judgment upon them (Leviticus 26:14-39).

This Mosaic Covenant was not a new revelation of God's character or nature, but rather an expansion of God's relationship with His people. It built upon the covenant between Yahweh and Abram/Abraham in Genesis 12, 15, and 17.

In Jesus Christ, the New Testament reveals that this Old Covenant has been superseded by a new covenant (Hebrews 8:6-13, 9:15), characterized by faith in Christ's work on the cross. This new covenant is based on God's unconditional love and redemption through Jesus' sacrifice, rather than human obedience to laws.

I hope this helps clarify the nature of the covenant between God and the people of Israel!
