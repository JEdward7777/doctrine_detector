They also connected it to the covenant with Abraham and the New Covenant through Jesus Christ. However, the student missed emphasizing the central aspect of the covenant, which is that the Israelites were God's chosen people, as per the reference answer. This oversight hinders a full understanding of the covenant's significance in relation to the chosen status of Israel."
