What a wonderful question! The promises made in biblical covenants are a testament to God's unwavering commitment to His people, showcasing His character as a faithful and merciful God. Let me break it down for you:

1. **Covenant of Creation**: In Genesis 9:8-17, God establishes the covenant with Noah after the flood. This covenant is based on God's promise to never again destroy the earth by water. It highlights God's commitment to preserve human life and His creation. This covenant sets the stage for understanding God's covenantal relationships throughout Scripture.
2. **Covenant of Promise**: In Genesis 12:1-3, God makes a covenant with Abram (later renamed Abraham), promising to make him the father of many nations and giving him the land of Canaan. This covenant is characterized by God's promise to bless those who come from Abram's descendants (Abraham's family). This sets the stage for understanding God's plan of redemption through the coming Messiah.
3. **Covenant of Circumcision**: In Genesis 17:1-14, God establishes a covenant with Abraham and his descendants, commanding them to circumcise themselves as a sign of their commitment to God. This covenant is based on God's promise to make Abraham the father of many nations and to bless those who come from him.
4. **Mosaic Covenant**: In Exodus 19-24, God gives the Israelites the Mosaic Law through Moses, establishing a covenant with them at Mount Sinai. This covenant outlines God's laws and regulations for the Israelites' relationship with Him and with each other. It is characterized by God's promise to be their God and to deliver them from slavery in Egypt.
5. **New Covenant**: In Jeremiah 31:31-34, Jesus Christ establishes a new covenant with His people, promising to write His laws on their hearts and minds. This covenant is based on God's promise to forgive sinners who turn to Him through faith.

Throughout these covenants, we see God's commitment to His people:

* **Faithfulness**: God remains faithful to His promises, even when His people fail or disobey.
* **Mercy**: God shows mercy and kindness to His people, forgiving their sins and offering new opportunities for redemption.
* **Redemption**: God's covenants are always centered on redemption, promising salvation and restoration to His people.
* **Unity**: God's covenants unite His people with Himself and with each other, creating a sense of community and belonging.

In conclusion, the promises made in biblical covenants illustrate God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture. They demonstrate His faithfulness, mercy, redemption, and unity, showcasing His character as a loving and gracious God who desires a deep relationship with humanity.
