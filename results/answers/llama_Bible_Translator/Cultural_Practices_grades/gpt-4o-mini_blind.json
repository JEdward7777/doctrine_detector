It accurately portrays the dietary restrictions, ritual purity concerns, worship separation, and laws of separation that existed in Jewish culture. The student effectively connects these practices to early Christian controversies, the mission to the Gentiles, challenges to Jewish traditions, and the development of Christian ethics.
