  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the cultural norms surrounding Gentiles in Jewish tradition, providing specific examples from dietary restrictions to laws of separation. It also effectively discusses how early Christianity responded to these cultural practices, including the Jerusalem Council and the development of Christian ethics. The writer's analysis is well-organized and easy to follow, making it clear that they have thoroughly considered the question.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 15 points because the response could be more concise and focused on the specific concern about how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices. While the response does touch on this topic, it could be more explicitly tied to the question. Additionally, some of the supporting details could be condensed or omitted without losing the overall coherence of the response.\n\nComment: The writer demonstrates a strong understanding of the Jewish culture and its implications for early Christianity. To take this response to the next level, consider incorporating more direct connections between the cultural norms and their influence on faith communities and practices."
