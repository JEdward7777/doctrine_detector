It effectively illustrates how these practices shaped early Christianity's development and the subsequent challenges faced by the apostles. The integration of biblical references and historical events provides solid support for the argument. The only improvement could be a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview and the transformative power of Jesus Christ in breaking down cultural barriers, but overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
