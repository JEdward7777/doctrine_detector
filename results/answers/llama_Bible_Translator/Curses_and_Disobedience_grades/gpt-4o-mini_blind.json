  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the concept of curses in the context of God's judgment on disobedient people in Galatians 3:10. The student effectively connects the passage with its Old Testament reference in Deuteronomy, explains the nature of curses in relation to God's justice, and emphasizes the need for faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. The doctrinal accuracy is strong, but the response could be slightly improved by delving deeper into the theological significance of Christ's fulfillment of the law and the believer's identification with Him."
