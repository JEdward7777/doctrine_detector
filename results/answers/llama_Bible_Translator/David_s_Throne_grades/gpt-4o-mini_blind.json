  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This answer provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the significance of the promise of David's throne lasting forever in Christian theology. The student effectively connects the promise to key biblical passages, such as 2 Samuel 7:12-13, and articulates how it foreshadows the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. The analysis of the messianic hope, eternal kingdom, perpetual lineage, and the contrast between human and divine rule demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian doctrine. Overall, a well-reasoned and doctrinally sound response."
