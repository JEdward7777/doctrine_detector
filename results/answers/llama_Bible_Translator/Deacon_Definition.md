## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the biblical context, the primary role of a deacon (also referred to as "servants" or "ministering servants") is to serve and support the needs of the congregation, particularly those in need. In Acts 6:1-6, we see that the apostles appointed seven men, who were chosen for their honesty, compassion, and integrity, to assist with the daily distribution of food and other necessities among the believers. This was done so that the apostles could focus on prayer and the ministry of the Word.

In 1 Timothy 3:8-13, we see a description of the qualifications and responsibilities of deacons, which include:

* Being faithful in their duties
* Not being double-tongued (i.e., not speaking out of both sides of their mouth)
* Not drinking excessively or pursuing worldly interests
* Having a reputation for good deeds
* Managing their own households well

The main responsibility of a deacon is to serve the church and its members, particularly those who are poor, widowed, orphaned, or in need. This may involve tasks such as:

* Distributing funds to those in need
* Providing spiritual care and support
* Assisting with hospital visits, visitation, and other forms of pastoral care
* Overseeing the church's social services and outreach programs

In summary, the primary role of a deacon is to serve the congregation by meeting practical needs, showing compassion and kindness, and supporting the pastor and elders in their ministry. Deacons are not ordained for preaching or teaching, but rather for serving and ministering to the needs of others.
