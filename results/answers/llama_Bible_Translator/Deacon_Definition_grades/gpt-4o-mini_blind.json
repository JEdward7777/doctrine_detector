  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-researched explanation of the primary role of a deacon in the local church. They have accurately referenced biblical passages such as Acts 6:1-6 and 1 Timothy 3:8-13 to support their points. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the servant-hearted nature of deacons and their responsibilities within the church community. Further elaboration on the spiritual aspect of deacons' service could enhance the answer."
