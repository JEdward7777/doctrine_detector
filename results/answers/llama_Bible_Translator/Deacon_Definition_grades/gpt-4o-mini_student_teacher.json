  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-explained answer to the question, covering biblical references and qualifications of deacons, as well as specific responsibilities and examples of tasks deacons may undertake in serving the church. However, the primary role of a deacon, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher, is more focused on practical needs like food or money. While the student's response encompasses a broader understanding of deacons' roles in the church, it slightly deviates from the core emphasis on practical assistance highlighted in the reference answer."
