## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Christian context, the term "adultery" is defined by Scripture as sexual intercourse outside of a monogamous, God-ordained marriage between one man and one woman. This definition is rooted in biblical principles and teachings.

The Bible defines adultery in several passages:

1. Exodus 20:17 - The Ten Commandments declare, "You shall not commit adultery." (NKJV)
2. Leviticus 18:20 - The Lord commands, "You shall not lie with a male as with a female; it is an abomination. Neither shall you mate with any beast, to pollute yourself with it; neither shall any woman yield her seed unto any beast, to defile herself therewith beside uncleanly." (NKJV)
3. Leviticus 20:10-11 - The Lord states, "If there is a man who lies carnally with another man's wife, then they shall both die. Whether it is the man or the woman, you shall not leave them alive. They have committed adultery."
4. Matthew 5:27-28 - Jesus teaches, "You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust is already committed adultery with her in his heart."

In this context, adultery refers specifically to:

* Sexual intimacy between two people who are not married to each other.
* Sexual intimacy within a marriage that is not monogamous (i.e., having multiple sexual partners).
* Sexual intimacy between individuals of the same gender.

This definition is based on God's original design for human relationships and sexuality, as outlined in Genesis 2:24-25. The Bible presents marriage as a covenantal relationship between one man and one woman, which is intended to be lifelong, monogamous, and exclusive (Ephesians 5:31; Hebrews 13:4).

In conclusion, in the Christian context, adultery is defined as sexual intercourse outside of a monogamous, God-ordained marriage between one man and one woman. This definition is rooted in biblical principles and teachings, and is intended to reflect God's original design for human relationships and sexuality.
