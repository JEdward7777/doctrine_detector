  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the biblical definition of adultery, supported by relevant scripture references. They correctly highlighted that adultery involves sexual intimacy outside of a monogamous, God-ordained marriage between one man and one woman, in line with Christian teachings. The inclusion of verses from both the Old and New Testaments, as well as the explanation of God's original design for marriage, demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. The student could have aligned more closely with the teacher's reference answer by explicitly stating that adultery is a sin and emphasizing the aspect of infidelity within marriage."
