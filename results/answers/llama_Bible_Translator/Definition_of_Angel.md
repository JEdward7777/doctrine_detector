A great question!

In the Bible, angels (Hebrew: מלאך, mal'ak; Greek: ἄγγελος, aggelos) are spiritual beings created by God to serve as messengers or intermediaries between humans and God. The biblical definition of an angel is found in Hebrews 1:14, which states that angels are "ministering spirits sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation."

The primary role of angels is to carry out God's instructions (Luke 1:26-38) and serve as messengers or heralds of His divine will (Matthew 2:13, Luke 2:9). They are often referred to as "messengers" or "ambassadors" of God (Hebrews 1:14).

In the Old Testament, angels appeared as human-like beings (Genesis 18:2, Daniel 10:5-6), but they were not considered equal to God. They were created by God and were subject to His authority (Psalm 148:2, Psalm 103:20). Their primary role was to communicate God's word or will to humans, often in the context of salvation history.

In the New Testament, angels are depicted as worshiping God (Luke 2:13-14) and serving as messengers of Christ's message (Matthew 28:5-7). They play a significant role in the life of Jesus, announcing His birth (Luke 1:26-38), death and resurrection (Matthew 28:5-7), and providing encouragement to believers (Acts 12:11).

It's essential to note that angels are not to be worshiped or considered equal to God. As Hebrews 1:6 says, "But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says, 'And let all the angels of God worship Him.'"
