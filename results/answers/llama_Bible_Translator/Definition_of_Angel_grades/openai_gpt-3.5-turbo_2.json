It accurately reflects the given answer about angels being created by God to carry out His instructions. The explanation from a Christian worldview is clear and grounded in scriptural references. It addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding the role of angels can deepen faith and provide assurance of God's protection and guidance. Great job!"
