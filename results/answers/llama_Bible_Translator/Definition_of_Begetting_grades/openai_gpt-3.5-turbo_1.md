# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In a Biblical context, the verb "to beget" (Hebrew: ילד, yalad; Greek: γέννησῃ, gennēsai) implies the concept of origin or generation. In other words, it refers to the act of bringing someone into existence or causing them to come into being.

In the Old Testament, the word "to beget" is often used to describe the relationship between God as the Creator and humans as His creation (e.g., Psalm 100:3; Isaiah 45:12). In this context, it highlights God's role in bringing humanity into existence and sustaining their lives.

In a more specific sense, the verb "to beget" is also used to describe the biological act of procreation between men and women. For example, Genesis 4:17-18 describes Cain as the one who "begot Enoch," emphasizing the human father's role in bringing his child into the world.

In Jesus' genealogy in Matthew 1:3-6, we read that Abraham "beget" Isaac, indicating the biological act of procreation. Similarly, Luke 3:34 notes that Solomon "beget" Rehoboam, highlighting the royal lineage and succession.

When applied to God's relationship with His people, "to beget" can also imply spiritual regeneration or new birth (John 1:13; 3:3-5). In this sense, it suggests that God is the One who brings people into a right relationship with Himself through faith in Jesus Christ (Galatians 4:4-7).

In summary, in a Biblical context, "to beget" implies origin, generation, or creation, whether referring to God's role as Creator, human procreation, or spiritual rebirth.
