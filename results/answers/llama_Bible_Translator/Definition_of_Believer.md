In the Bible, a believer is typically referred to as a "believer" or a "Christian" (Greek: Χριστιανός, Christíanos). However, there are several other terms that describe someone who has placed their faith in Jesus Christ.

Here are some key definitions:

1. Believer (Greek: πιστός, pistós): In 1 Corinthians 6:2-3 and 1 Corinthians 7:12-13, Paul uses the term "believer" to refer to individuals who have trusted in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
2. Christian (Greek: Χριστιανός, Christíanos): The term "Christian" is first used in Acts 11:26 and Acts 26:28 to describe followers of Jesus Christ. It emphasizes their connection to the person and teachings of Jesus Christ.
3. Disciple (Greek: μαθητής, mathētēs): In the Gospels, a disciple refers to someone who follows Jesus as their teacher and Lord (Matthew 5:1-2, John 12:26).
4. Follower of Christ (Greek: ἀκολουθῶν τῷ Χριστῷ, akolouthōn tō Christē): This phrase appears in Matthew 8:9-10 and 9:38 to describe individuals who follow Jesus' teachings and example.
5. New Man (Greek: ἄνθρωπος νέος, anthrōpos neos): In Colossians 3:10, Paul uses this term to describe someone who has been transformed by their faith in Jesus Christ.

In general, the Bible defines a believer as someone who:

* Has placed their faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior (Acts 16:30-31)
* Has repented of their sins and turned to God (Luke 24:47, Acts 2:38)
* Lives according to the teachings and example of Jesus Christ (Matthew 5:1-2, John 12:26)
* Demonstrates love for God and others (John 14:15, 17:23)

These definitions emphasize the importance of faith, repentance, and obedience in becoming a believer.
