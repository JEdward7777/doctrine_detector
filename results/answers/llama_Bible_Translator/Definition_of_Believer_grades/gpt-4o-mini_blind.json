It effectively emphasizes the key components of faith, repentance, following Jesus, and demonstrating love. Well-done! The only minor area for improvement could be to incorporate a brief mention of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers as another defining characteristic, in line with the broader Biblical understanding of salvation and the Christian life (Romans 8:9, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20)."
