  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that includes various biblical terms and references to describe a believer in Christ.

However, the core essence of being a believer according to the provided reference answer - belief in and reliance on Jesus Christ as Savior - should have been the central focus of their response."
