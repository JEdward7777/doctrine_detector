## [Answer](../Definition_of_Beloved.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In a biblical context, the term "beloved" (Hebrew: חֶבֶר; Greek: ἀγαπητός) carries significant theological meaning. It is often used to describe individuals who have a special relationship with God or are deeply loved by Him.

In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word "chaver" (חֶבֶר) is translated as "beloved" and typically connotes a deep affection or intimacy between two parties. For example, in Psalm 119:76, the psalmist describes himself as God's "beloved" (Hebrew: חָבְרִי), indicating a personal connection with Yahweh.

In the New Testament, the Greek word "agapetos" (ἀγαπητός) is used to describe individuals who are deeply loved by God. This term is often translated as "beloved" and emphasizes a sense of deep affection or devotion. For instance, in Romans 9:25, Paul writes that God is willing to be merciful to those He loves (Greek: ἀγαπαῖς), using the term "agapetos" to describe those who are dear to Him.

In both Testaments, the term "beloved" can also imply a sense of adoption or sonship. For example, in Romans 8:29, Paul writes that God predestined believers to be conformed to the image of His Son, and that this conforming is done out of love (Greek: ἀγάπη), indicating that they are beloved by God.

Theologically, the term "beloved" speaks to the concept of divine election and redemption. It suggests that those who are beloved by God have been chosen for a special purpose and are deeply loved despite their sinfulness. This understanding is reinforced in passages like Ephesians 1:4-5, where believers are described as being chosen according to God's sovereign will and predestined to be adopted as His children.

In summary, the term "beloved" in a biblical context signifies a deep and intimate relationship between an individual and God. It implies adoption, redemption, and a special connection with Yahweh, emphasizing that those who are beloved by Him have been chosen for a divine purpose.
