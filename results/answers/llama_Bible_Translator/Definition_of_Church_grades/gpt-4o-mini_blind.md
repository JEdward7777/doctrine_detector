## [Answer](../Definition_of_Church.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the term "church" (Greek: ἐκκλησία, ekklēsia) refers to a gathering of believers who are united under Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.

The Greek word ἐκκλησία is derived from two words: ἔκ (ek), meaning "out of," and κλησία (klēsia), meaning "calling." So, the term ἐκκλησία can be literally translated to "called out ones" or "those who are called out."

In the New Testament, the church refers to a local community of believers who have been united by their faith in Jesus Christ. This community is characterized by its shared commitment to following Jesus and living according to His teachings.

The New Testament presents the church as a unified body of believers who are connected to each other and to Jesus through the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:13). The church is not just a social club or a gathering of like-minded individuals, but rather a spiritual entity that is indwelt by the Holy Spirit and united in its mission to spread the gospel and worship God.

In many passages, the term "church" refers specifically to local congregations, such as the churches at Ephesus (Ephesians 1:1), Galatia (Galatians 1:2), Corinth (1 Corinthians 1:2), and Rome (Romans 1:8). However, in other passages, the term "church" can refer to the universal body of believers throughout history, such as when Jesus says that He will build His church (Matthew 16:18).

Overall, the term "church" in the New Testament refers to a dynamic community of believers who are united under Jesus Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit to live out their faith in obedience to God's will.
