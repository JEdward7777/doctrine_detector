  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament, emphasizing the unity of believers under Jesus Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit within the church community. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the church as a dynamic community of believers rather than a mere physical structure. The only minor improvement would be to further elaborate on the distinction between the universal church and local assemblies, but overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the church's role beyond being just a building."
