  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of confession according to the Bible. The student effectively incorporates relevant biblical passages and theological concepts in their explanation. The emphasis on the recognition of sin, acknowledgment of Jesus' lordship, and trust in God's forgiveness aligns well with Christian teachings on confession. The response could be slightly improved by including more references to the Old Testament in relation to confession, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
