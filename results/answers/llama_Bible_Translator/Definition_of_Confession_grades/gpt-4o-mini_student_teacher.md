## [Answer](../Definition_of_Confession.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, to confess (Greek: homologeo or Gk: egontai) means to agree with God's assessment of one's situation and to acknowledge His sovereignty. It involves expressing regret for sin and turning away from it, while also affirming faith in God's redemption through Jesus Christ.

Confession is not just a matter of verbal agreement, but rather a deep-seated recognition of our spiritual state before God. It implies a willingness to surrender our old life and its patterns, and to submit to God's transforming power.

In the New Testament, confession is often linked with salvation and forgiveness. For example, when Peter preached on Pentecost, he said that Jesus is "the stone which was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the chief cornerstone" (Acts 4:11). Those who believed this message and responded in faith were said to have "confessed" or acknowledged Jesus as Lord (Acts 2:21).

The apostle Paul also emphasizes confession in his writings. In Romans 10:9-10, he says that if we confess Jesus as Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, we will be saved. Similarly, in 1 Corinthians 12:3, he notes that no one can say "Jesus is Lord" except by the Holy Spirit.

In Christian terminology, confession typically involves three elements:

1. Recognition of sin (Romans 3:23; 5:12).
2. Acknowledgment of Jesus' lordship and redemption (Philippians 2:9-11; Hebrews 13:15).
3. Trust in God's forgiveness and cleansing (1 John 1:9; Ephesians 4:32).

Throughout the Bible, confession is portrayed as a vital step towards spiritual renewal, peace with God, and effective prayer (Matthew 6:12; Mark 11:25). By confessing our sins to God and receiving His mercy and grace, we can experience the transformation that only He can bring.
