## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "evangelist" comes from the Greek word εὐαγγελιστής (euangelistēs), which is derived from εὖ αγγέλλω (eu angello), meaning "to bring good news" or "to announce good tidings."

In a literal sense, an evangelist is someone who brings or proclaims good news. In the context of the New Testament, an evangelist is one who preaches and proclaims the Gospel message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.

The term "evangelist" is used only twice in the New Testament: once to describe Philip (Acts 21:8) and once to describe Luke himself (Luke 1:3). However, the concept of evangelism is a central theme throughout the New Testament, as seen in the ministries of Jesus, the Twelve Apostles, and other early Christian leaders.

In modern usage, an evangelist is often understood as someone who shares the Gospel message with others, often through preaching, teaching, or personal witness. However, it's important to note that this understanding is rooted in the original meaning of the term, which emphasizes proclaiming good news about Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on behalf of humanity.
