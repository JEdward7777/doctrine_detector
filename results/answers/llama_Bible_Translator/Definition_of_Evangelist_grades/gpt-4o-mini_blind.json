  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 95. The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the literal meaning of the term \"evangelist\" from its Greek root, along with its significance in the context of the New Testament. The student effectively connects the term to its broader theological and historical implications, both in scripture and in modern usage. The only suggestion for improvement might be to include a brief mention of the Great Commission as a key aspect of evangelism in the New Testament."
