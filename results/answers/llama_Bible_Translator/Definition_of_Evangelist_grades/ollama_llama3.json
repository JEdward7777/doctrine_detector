  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response accurately conveys the literal meaning of the term \"evangelist\" as someone who brings or proclaims good news, which aligns with the provided answer. Additionally, it provides some contextual information about the role of an evangelist in the New Testament and its connection to sharing the Gospel message.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not fully engage with the concern of understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel. While it mentions the importance of proclaiming good news about Jesus Christ and His redemptive work, it could have delved deeper into the specifics of how evangelists carried out their ministry in the New Testament era.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the term \"evangelist\" but could benefit from further development on the role of an evangelist in sharing the Gospel."
