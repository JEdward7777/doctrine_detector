The student effectively explains the origin, nature, purpose, and power of these concepts, weaving in relevant biblical references to support their points. The response is well-structured, coherent, and reflects a solid understanding of Christian theology. The language used is reverent and thoughtful, making it a strong exploration of the topic within a Christian worldview. Great job!"
