  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provides a thorough and deeply insightful analysis of the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil', emphasizing their relational and ontological aspects rooted in God's character. They effectively contrast 'good' as aligning with God's will and nature, while 'evil' is portrayed as rebellion against God and characterized by negative qualities. The student also excellently addresses key differences between 'good' and 'evil' in terms of origin, nature, purpose, and power, revealing a strong grasp of the Christian worldview on morality.\n\nThe student's response is well-written, demonstrates a clear understanding of Biblical principles, and effectively connects these notions to daily decision-making. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the concern provided by linking the discussion of 'good' and 'evil' to practical moral implications in daily choices. Nonetheless, the student's profound theological insights and comprehensive analysis warrant a high grade."
