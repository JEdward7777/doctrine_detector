## [Answer](../Definition_of_Gospel.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "gospel" comes from the Old English word "gōdspell," which means "good news." In its biblical sense, the gospel refers to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. The Greek New Testament uses the word εὐαγγέλιον (euangelion), also meaning "good news" or "glad tidings."

In the Bible, the gospel is understood as the announcement of God's saving plan for humanity, centered on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It includes the message that God has reconciled us to Himself through faith in Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:19) and offers salvation from sin, its consequences, and eternal separation.

The gospel is not just a message about what happens, but also a declaration of what God has done for humanity through Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross. The apostle Paul wrote that "the gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes" (Romans 1:16). In this sense, the gospel is not just information or news, but a powerful, transformative message that brings about spiritual rebirth and redemption.

Throughout the New Testament, the gospel is closely tied to the person and work of Jesus Christ. The gospel is the announcement that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God (Matthew 1:21; John 1:14), who has come to save humanity from sin and its consequences. It emphasizes that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ alone, apart from human works or efforts (Ephesians 2:8-9).

In summary, the term "gospel" literally means "good news," but in the biblical context, it refers specifically to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ, emphasizing God's saving plan for humanity and the transformative power of faith in Him.
