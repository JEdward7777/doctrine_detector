  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible, including references from both the Old and New Testaments. They correctly highlighted the significance of God's holiness and the unique role of Jesus as the Holy One of God. However, there was an excess of additional information and interpretations beyond the specific concern of understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture. The answer could have been more focused on directly addressing the concern."
