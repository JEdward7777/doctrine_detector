## [Answer](../Definition_of_Holy_One.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

The term "Holy One" (Hebrew: קדוש, Qadosh) is a significant concept in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. It refers to God's essential nature and character as separate from all that is profane or common.

In the Old Testament, "Holy One" is used interchangeably with "Lord of Hosts" (Yahweh Tzevaot) and "God Most High" (Elohim Chai). These titles emphasize God's sovereignty, power, and absolute moral purity. The term "Holy One" is often associated with God's covenant relationship with Israel, emphasizing His commitment to keeping Himself apart from all that is impure or idolatrous.

In Psalm 16:10, David writes, "You will not let your Holy One see decay." This verse looks forward to the coming Messiah, who would be the Holy One of God. In Isaiah 57:15, we read, "For thus says the High and Lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy..." Here, the phrase refers to God's transcendent nature and His dwelling in the heavens.

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is often referred to as the "Holy One of God" (Matthew 1:20; Mark 1:24). This title highlights His unique relationship with God the Father and His messianic role. Jesus' sinless life, death on the cross, and resurrection demonstrate that He was indeed the Holy One sent by God to reconcile humanity to Himself.

Throughout Scripture, the concept of the "Holy One" underscores God's moral perfection, His separation from all that is impure, and His desire for a people who would worship Him in spirit and truth. As we read these passages, we are reminded of our need for personal holiness and our dependence on God's grace to make us like His Holy One.

As believers, we can draw encouragement and guidance from the character and works of the Holy One. May we strive to be more like Jesus, the embodiment of God's holy nature, as we seek to live according to His will and glorify Him in all we do.
