In the Old Testament, the "holy place" (Hebrew: הַקֹדֶשׁ) refers to the innermost sanctuary within the tabernacle or temple. It was a sacred space where God's presence dwelled among His people.

The holy place was separated from the outer courtyard and the priests' chambers by a series of curtains, screens, and pillars (Exodus 26:33-34; 27:9). This physical separation symbolized the spiritual divide between God's divine realm and the human world.

Significance:

1. **God's presence**: The holy place was where God's glory dwelled, as described in Exodus 25:8, "Let them construct an ark of acacia wood...and cover it with pure gold. Within, you shall put the Testimony, which I will give you." This passage emphasizes that God's presence was not just a spiritual reality but a physical manifestation.
2. **Divine-human interaction**: The holy place facilitated direct communication between God and His people. Priests would enter this sacred space to offer sacrifices, burn incense, and consult with God (Leviticus 16:16-18; Numbers 7:4).
3. **Consecration**: The holy place was where the priests were consecrated or set apart for God's service (Exodus 28:29-30). This physical act of consecration reflected the spiritual transformation that took place as they approached God.
4. **Sin and purification**: The holy place was also where sin offerings were made to purify the people and the priests themselves (Leviticus 16:15-19; Hebrews 9:11-14). This emphasis on purification and atonement prefigures Christ's ultimate sacrifice, which cleanses humanity from sin.
5. **Typology**: The holy place foreshadowed Jesus Christ, who is the true Temple of God (John 2:19-21). Jesus, as the Messiah, is the ultimate Holy Place where God dwells among His people, offering atonement and purification for all humanity.

In conclusion, the "holy place" in the context of the tabernacle or temple represents a sacred space where God's presence dwelled, facilitating divine-human interaction, consecration, sin purification, and typological foreshadowing of Christ.
