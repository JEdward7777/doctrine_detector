According to the Bible, to repent (Hebrew: שוב, shuv; Greek: μετANOIA) means to have a profound change of heart and mind that leads to a radical turning away from sin and towards God. This concept is deeply rooted in both Old and New Testaments.

In the Old Testament, repentance (Hebrew: שוב) often referred to Israel's return to God after periods of apostasy or rebellion. It was seen as a turning back to God, acknowledging one's sins, and seeking forgiveness. For example:

* Joel 2:12-13: "Yet even now," declares the Lord, "return to me with weeping, and with mourning like a fast. Tear your heart and not your garments." (This passage emphasizes the need for inner change rather than just external rituals.)
* Jonah 3:10: When God saw what they did and that they turned from their evil ways, God relented concerning the calamity He said He would bring upon them.

In the New Testament, Jesus taught that repentance is a necessary step towards salvation (Matthew 4:17; Mark 1:15). The Greek word for repentance, metanoia, carries a sense of "change of mind" or "conversion." It's not just about feeling sorry for one's sins but also about changing direction and pursuing a new path. For instance:

* Matthew 21:28-32: Jesus taught that true repentance involves more than just saying "I'm sorry"; it requires a fundamental change in behavior.
* Luke 15:11-32: The parable of the prodigal son illustrates the concept of repentance as a turning away from sin and back to God.

In Christian theology, repentance is often seen as a necessary precursor to faith (Acts 3:19; Hebrews 6:1). It involves:

1. Acknowledging one's sinfulness (Romans 3:23; 5:12-13).
2. Recognizing the need for forgiveness and salvation (Luke 24:46-47; John 3:16-17).
3. Turning away from sin and towards God, expressing sorrow for past mistakes, and seeking a new path of righteousness.

In this sense, repentance is not just a one-time event but rather an ongoing process of surrendering to God's will and conforming to His character (Romans 12:1-2; Ephesians 4:20-24).
