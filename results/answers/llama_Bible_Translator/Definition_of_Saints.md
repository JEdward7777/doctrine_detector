## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" (Greek: hagioi) refers to believers in Jesus Christ who have been sanctified by God and are set apart for His purposes. The word "hagioi" is often translated as "saints," but it's important to note that this translation can be misleading, as it may conjure up images of Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox saints, which is not the intention of the New Testament authors.

In the New Testament, the term "hagioi" specifically refers to believers who have been justified by faith in Jesus Christ and are now part of God's holy people. This is evident from passages such as Romans 1:7, where Paul writes to "all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people," or Ephesians 1:1, where he addresses the "saints" (hagioi) in Ephesus.

The term "saints" is often used interchangeably with "believers" or "the faithful," emphasizing that all believers are united as one body of Christ. This usage is consistent throughout the New Testament, including in letters like 1 Corinthians 1:2, 2 Corinthians 1:1, and Philippians 1:1.

In this sense, the term "saints" does not refer to a specific class of holy people who have achieved some sort of moral or spiritual level. Rather, it's an inclusive term that emphasizes the believers' common identity in Christ and their shared status as God's chosen people.

It's worth noting that the New Testament also uses other terms to describe believers, such as "brethren" (adelphoi), "believers," or simply "the church." However, when the term "saints" is used, it specifically highlights the believer's relationship with God and their status as part of His holy people.
