  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the concept of sanctification in both Old and New Testaments, providing clear examples from Scripture to illustrate its meaning. It also recognizes that sanctification is not just an instantaneous event but an ongoing process throughout one's life. The language used is precise and biblical, with references to specific Strong's numbers, making it evident that the writer has a strong understanding of the subject matter.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to further develop the application of sanctification in everyday Christian life. While the response does touch on the importance of cooperation with the Holy Spirit and deliberate effort to resist sin, it could benefit from more practical advice or examples of how believers can actively pursue sanctification in their daily walk with God.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical concept of sanctification."
