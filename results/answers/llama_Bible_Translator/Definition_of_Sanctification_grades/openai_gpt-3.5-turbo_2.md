## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Bible, to sanctify or to be sanctified means to set apart something (or someone) for God's purposes and use. This concept is central to Christian theology, particularly in regards to salvation and the life of a believer.

In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word "qadash" (Strong's #6942) is often translated as "to sanctify." When used in this sense, it means to consecrate or set apart something or someone for God's use. For example, Leviticus 8:30 says, "And when Moses had finished consecrating (or sanctifying) the tabernacle and all its furnishings, he anointed it and presented it to the Lord." In this context, the tabernacle was being set apart for God's glory and worship.

In the New Testament, the Greek word "hagiaz≈ç" (Strong's #38) is used to convey the idea of sanctification. Jesus Christ, as the ultimate High Priest, has offered himself as a sacrifice for our sins, thereby making us holy (or sanctified) in God's sight (Hebrews 10:10-14). This is often referred to as positional sanctity, meaning that every believer is considered holy because of their union with Christ.

However, this is not just a one-time event; it is also an ongoing process. As believers walk in obedience to God's will and put their faith into practice (James 2:14-26), they are progressively being sanctified or set apart for God's purposes. This sanctification is often referred to as progressive sanctity.

In this sense, sanctification is not just about being made holy at the moment of salvation but also about growing in holiness and becoming more like Christ throughout our lives (2 Corinthians 3:18). It involves a deliberate effort on our part to resist sin and its temptation, while trusting God's power and enabling us to become the people He created us to be.

As believers, we are called to cooperate with the Holy Spirit's work in our lives, allowing Him to conform us to the image of Christ (Romans 8:29-30). This process is not always easy or instantaneous, but it is an essential part of living out our faith and glorifying God.
