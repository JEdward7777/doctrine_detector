It effectively communicates the idea that sanctification is both a one-time event through Christ's sacrifice and an ongoing process of growth and transformation for believers. The incorporation of relevant Bible verses and theological insights demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical definition of sanctification from a Christian worldview."
