They correctly emphasized the importance of faith in Jesus Christ, membership in the body of believers, following Jesus' teachings, baptism, and receiving the Holy Spirit. However, they could have further expanded on the concept of repentance and transformation that accompanies becoming a Christian, as highlighted in passages like Acts 2:38. Additionally, reinforcing the uniqueness of Christ as the only way to salvation would have added doctrinal depth to the definition of a Christian."
