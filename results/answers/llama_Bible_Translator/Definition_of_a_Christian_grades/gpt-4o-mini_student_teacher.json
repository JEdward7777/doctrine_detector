  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer by referencing biblical passages and characteristics associated with being a Christian. However, the student's answer included additional details beyond the concise definition provided in the reference answer. The student's answer did not explicitly state the belief that Jesus is the Son of God and the aspect of trusting Jesus for salvation, which are core components of being a Christian from a biblical perspective. Therefore, the grade is slightly lower than full marks."
