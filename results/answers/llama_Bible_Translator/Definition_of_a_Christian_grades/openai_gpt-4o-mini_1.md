## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Christian.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Christian" is not explicitly defined in the New Testament, but we can infer its meaning by examining the way it is used and the characteristics that are associated with it.

In Acts 11:26, Luke writes that "the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch." This phrase suggests that the term "Christian" was a nickname or an epithet given to believers in Jesus Christ. In Acts 26:28, King Agrippa asks Paul if he's trying to persuade him and his household to become "such as are almost all Jews again; it is very little that thou hast found this way among them on the road, for it seems a thing most small among the people." This quote implies that being a Christian was seen as a distinct identity or movement within Judaism.

In terms of biblical characteristics, a Christian can be defined as someone who:

1. Has placed their faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior (Acts 16:31).
2. Belongs to the body of believers, which is often referred to as the "church" (Matthew 16:18; Ephesians 1:22-23).
3. Is committed to following Jesus' teachings and example (John 14:15; 1 John 2:6).
4. Has been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ (Acts 8:12, 36; Romans 6:3-4).
5. Has received the gift of the Holy Spirit, which is often referred to as being "born again" or having a new birth (John 3:3-7; Acts 2:38).

In summary, a Christian can be defined as someone who has placed their faith in Jesus Christ, belongs to the body of believers, follows Jesus' teachings and example, has been baptized in his name, and has received the gift of the Holy Spirit.
