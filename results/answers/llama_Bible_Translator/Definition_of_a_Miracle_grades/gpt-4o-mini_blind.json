  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a well-rounded and thorough explanation of miracles within the Christian worldview. They correctly highlight the various purposes of miracles and their relation to God's authority. The inclusion of relevant Scriptures strengthens the response. However, the response could be improved by deepening the theological analysis and expanding on the significance of miracles in terms of Jesus being the Messiah and Son of God. Additionally, a more explicit connection between miracles and God's authority could be made throughout the response for greater coherence."
