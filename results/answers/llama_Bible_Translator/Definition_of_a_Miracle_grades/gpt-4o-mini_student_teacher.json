They have effectively explained the concept of miracles in relation to God's authority, highlighted key biblical principles, and shown a good understanding of how miracles deepen faith and acknowledge God's power. The answer could be improved by incorporating more direct references to the concern provided and by enhancing the connection between miracles and deepening faith."
