  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThis response is excellent in its accuracy, depth, and biblical basis. It provides a clear definition of miracles and highlights their significance in demonstrating God's authority, power, wisdom, and love. The inclusion of various purposes and examples from Scripture adds strength to the response.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that it could be more concise in its presentation. Some of the points made are well-supported by Scripture, but they could be summarized more effectively. Additionally, while the response provides a clear biblical basis for the concept of miracles, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the concept and the concern about deepening faith and acknowledgment of God's power.\n\nOverall, however, this is an outstanding response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of miracles in a Christian context."
