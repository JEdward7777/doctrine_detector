The inclusion of references to biblical passages supports the points made. The transition to the New Testament and the role of Jesus Christ in fulfilling the covenant is well-stated. However, a higher grade could be achieved by further emphasizing the emphasis on God's holiness and the calling to holiness within the covenant relationship, and by integrating more references to foundational Old Testament texts like Leviticus and Psalms to depict the depth of the covenant relationship between God and His people."
