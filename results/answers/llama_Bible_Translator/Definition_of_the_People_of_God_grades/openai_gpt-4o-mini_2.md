## [Answer](../Definition_of_the_People_of_God.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Old Testament, being considered one of the "people of God" refers to Israel's special relationship with Yahweh, their God and Creator. This concept is rooted in God's covenant with Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3) and reiterated throughout the history of Israel.

To be considered part of the people of God means that an individual or a community has been chosen by Yahweh to be His treasured possession, set apart from other nations and cultures. This distinction is not based on human merit or achievement but rather on God's sovereign choice and grace.

As described in Deuteronomy 7:6-8, being one of the people of God means:

* Being a descendant of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ( Genesis 12:3; Exodus 2:24)
* Having received the law and commandments from Yahweh through Moses (Exodus 19:5-6; Deuteronomy 4:1-8)
* Living according to God's laws and statutes as revealed in the Torah (Deuteronomy 26:17-18)
* Being in a special covenant relationship with Yahweh, characterized by loyalty, obedience, and trust (Exodus 19:5-6; Jeremiah 7:23)

Throughout Israel's history, this people-of-God identity was marked by:

* Unique cultural practices, such as circumcision, dietary laws, and festivals (Genesis 17:9-14; Leviticus 23)
* Sacred institutions like the priesthood, tabernacle/tent of meeting, and temple in Jerusalem (Exodus 25-31; Numbers 1:50-51)
* Prophetic calls to repentance, justice, and faithfulness to Yahweh's covenant (Isaiah 40:1-11; Jeremiah 30:8-9)

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel. Through His death and resurrection, He offers salvation to all nations, including Gentiles (non-Jews), who can become part of the people of God by faith in Him (Galatians 3:26-29; Ephesians 2:11-22). This new covenant relationship is characterized by a personal connection with God through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.
