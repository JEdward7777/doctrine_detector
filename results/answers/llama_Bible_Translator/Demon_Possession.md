## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, demonic possession refers to a situation where an individual's spirit, or inner being, is controlled or dominated by one or more evil spirits (demons). This concept is rooted in Old Testament Jewish thought and is explicitly described in the New Testament.

The New Testament uses various terms to describe this phenomenon, including:

1. "Possessed" (Grk. ekpneustos): This term emphasizes the demon's control over the person's thoughts, emotions, or actions.
2. "Seized" or "taken with" (Grk. krateo): This phrase highlights the sudden and violent nature of the demonic influence.
3. "Demon-possessed" (Grk. daimonion enastos): This term explicitly links the person's condition to the presence and control of demons.

According to Scripture, demonic possession can manifest in various ways, including:

1. Unusual behavior or actions that are out of character for the individual.
2. A person's speech or voice being altered or controlled by the demon.
3. Physical manifestations, such as convulsions, contortions, or spasms.
4. A loss of cognitive control, leading to irrational decisions or behaviors.

The Bible also provides insight into the nature and motivations of demons:

1. Demons are fallen angels who rebelled against God (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 12:7-9).
2. They seek to oppress and deceive humans, often by exploiting their weaknesses and fears.
3. Demons can be cast out or resisted through faith in Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit (Mark 5:1-20; Luke 8:26-39).

In terms of the person's responsibility and culpability, the Bible teaches that:

1. The individual is not fully responsible for their actions while under demonic influence.
2. However, they can be held accountable for their actions if they resist or reject God's offer of salvation (Matthew 12:43-45).
3. Believers are called to pray for and deliver those afflicted by demons, as a demonstration of God's power and love (Mark 9:38-41).

It is essential to approach the topic of demonic possession with a balanced understanding of the biblical teachings on the subject. While recognizing the reality of demonic influence, we must also emphasize the importance of faith in Jesus Christ and the need for spiritual discernment and wisdom.
