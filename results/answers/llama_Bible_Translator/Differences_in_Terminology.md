## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I'm delighted to help clarify the nuances of these three related but distinct terms in biblical Greek.

In 1 Thessalonians 4:18, Paul writes: "Therefore encourage each other with these words" (NASB). In this context, the Greek word ἐγكومέω (egkomēo) is used, which is often translated as "encourage."

The term "encourage" typically carries a sense of urging or stimulating someone to take action, often with a positive and supportive tone. When Paul encourages the Thessalonians, he's motivating them to remain faithful and to live in a way that honors God.

In contrast, the Greek word παρακαλέω (parakaleō), which means "to call beside" or "to comfort," is used in many passages to convey a sense of comforting, reassuring, or strengthening someone. For example, Paul encourages Timothy with these words: "You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus" (2 Timothy 2:1).

Now, let's consider the term "admonish." The Greek word νουθετεῖν (nouthetein) carries a sense of warning or cautioning someone. When we admonish someone, we're pointing out potential dangers or negative consequences if they don't change their behavior. Admonition often involves a corrective or reproof aspect.

In biblical contexts, the term "admonish" is often used to convey a strong sense of moral urgency. For instance, Jesus warns his disciples: "But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea" (Matthew 18:6). In this passage, Jesus is admonishing his followers to take seriously their responsibility to care for the vulnerable.

In summary:

* "Encourage" typically involves urging or stimulating someone to take action with a positive tone.
* "Admonish" often carries a sense of warning or cautioning someone about potential dangers or negative consequences.
* While there can be some overlap between these terms, they generally convey different nuances.
