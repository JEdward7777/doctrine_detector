  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the differences between 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' from a biblical perspective, referencing specific Greek terms and biblical passages. The student effectively conveyed the nuances of each term and their implications for behavior. However, the student's response could have benefitted from more direct scriptural references to support their explanation and strengthen the Christian worldview perspective. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated, but the inclusion of additional scriptural examples would have further emphasized the importance of appropriate use according to scripture."
