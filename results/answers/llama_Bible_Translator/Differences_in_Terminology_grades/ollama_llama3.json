  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the nuances between \"encourage,\" \"admonish,\" and related terms in biblical Greek. The writer provides clear examples from Scripture to illustrate each term's meaning, which helps to clarify their differences. The response also acknowledges potential overlap between these terms while highlighting distinct connotations.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are minor, such as the need for more explicit connections between the biblical examples provided and the broader concern of clarifying appropriate forms of encouragement according to scripture. Additionally, a brief summary or conclusion that explicitly relates the terms back to the original concern would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, this response provides a thoughtful and well-organized exploration of these important terms in biblical Greek, making it a strong submission."
