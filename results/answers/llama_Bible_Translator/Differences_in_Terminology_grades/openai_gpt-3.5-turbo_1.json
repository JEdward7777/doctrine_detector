  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and well-supported explanation of the nuances of \"encourage,\" \"admonish,\" and \"exhort\" in biblical Greek, relating them to appropriate forms of encouragement according to scripture. The biblical references and explanations align well with Christian teachings on exhortation and admonition. The only minor critique is that the explanation could have included more explicit references to the term \"exhort\" as mentioned in the original answer, even though it was not part of the provided biblical examples. Overall, a strong and insightful analysis from a Christian perspective."
