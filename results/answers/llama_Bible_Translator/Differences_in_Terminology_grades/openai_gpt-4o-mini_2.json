  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the different forms of encouragement based on biblical Greek terms, covering their nuances and implications within a Christian worldview. The connection to relevant scripture passages further enhances the understanding of the distinctions between exhort, encourage, and admonish. The response aligns well with the concerns regarding clarifying the appropriate use of these forms of encouragement according to scripture. Great job in weaving together linguistic analysis with scriptural application."
