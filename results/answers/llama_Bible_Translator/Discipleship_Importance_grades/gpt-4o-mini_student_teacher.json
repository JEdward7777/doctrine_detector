However, the response lacked a clear focus on the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, as the reference answer emphasizes their mission to spread Jesus' teachings and establish the early Church. The student's answer could have been improved by explicitly connecting the characteristics of the apostles to their role in furthering Jesus' ministry and the foundation of the Church."
