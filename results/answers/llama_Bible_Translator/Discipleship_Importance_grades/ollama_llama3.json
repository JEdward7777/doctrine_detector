The writer mentions various connections between the apostles and John the Baptist, as well as their geographical diversity, which is relevant to understanding their roles in Jesus' ministry.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern of understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. While it touches on their roles in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church, it does not delve deeper into the biblical context or explore the theological implications of their selection.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could benefit from further analysis of the apostles' roles in the New Testament narrative, as well as consideration of the theological themes and motifs that surround their selection."
