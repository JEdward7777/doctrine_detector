  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-informed and thoughtful explanation of why Jesus chose the specific twelve apostles. It correctly highlights various aspects such as their familiarity with Jesus, geographical diversity, specific characteristics, and background diversity. The answer effectively addresses the concern about understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. However, it slightly deviates from the given answer by elaborating on additional details rather than explicitly tying the apostles' selection to their unique call to spread Jesus' teachings and establish the foundation of the early Church. Overall, a solid response with a comprehensive understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
