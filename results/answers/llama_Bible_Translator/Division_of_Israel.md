## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
After King Solomon's reign, one of the most significant events in Israel's history was the division of the kingdom into two parts: the Kingdom of Israel (also known as Samaria) and the Kingdom of Judah.

This event occurred around 931 BC, according to 1 Kings 12:16-24. The reason for the division was a dispute between the northern tribes (led by Jeroboam) and the southern tribes (led by Rehoboam, Solomon's son) over who would succeed Solomon as king. When Solomon died, his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king of Israel, but he ignored the counsel of the older advisors and listened instead to the young men who had grown up with him. This led to a rebellion in the north, which resulted in the division of the kingdom.

The Kingdom of Israel was ruled by Jeroboam's dynasty for 209 years until it was conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BC (2 Kings 17:1-23). The Kingdom of Judah continued to exist until its capital city, Jerusalem, was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BC, as recorded in 2 Kings 25:1-21.
