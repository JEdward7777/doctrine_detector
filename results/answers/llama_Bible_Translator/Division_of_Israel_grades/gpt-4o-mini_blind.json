  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of the division of the kingdom after King Solomon's reign, referencing the relevant biblical passages. It accurately details the events leading to the split between the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah and mentions the subsequent histories of both kingdoms. The historical and biblical context is well explained. However, to improve the grade, the student could have included a brief mention of the spiritual aspect, specifically how this division was a result of the disobedience of the kings and the people of Israel to God's commands, leading to the consequences outlined in Deuteronomy 28. Such a theological reflection would enhance the doctrinal depth of the response."
