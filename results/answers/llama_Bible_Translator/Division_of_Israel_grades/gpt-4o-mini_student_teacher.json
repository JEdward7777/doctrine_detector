  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the division of the Israelites after King Solomon's reign, discussing the reasons for the division, the leadership in both kingdoms, and the eventual fates of the two kingdoms. The biblical references cited support the response well. However, the level of detail provided slightly exceeds the simplicity of the reference answer, which is why it is not a perfect score."
