It accurately highlights the dispute between the northern and southern tribes, leading to the split into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah. The scriptural references add depth to the explanation within a Christian worldview perspective. However, there could have been additional mention of the spiritual implications of this division and how it reflected the Israelites' relationship with God, which would have further enriched the response."
