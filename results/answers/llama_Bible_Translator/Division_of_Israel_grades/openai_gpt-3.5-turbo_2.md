## [Answer](../Division_of_Israel.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
After King Solomon's reign, one of the most significant events in Israel's history was the division of the kingdom into two parts: the Kingdom of Israel (also known as Samaria) and the Kingdom of Judah.

This event occurred around 931 BC, according to 1 Kings 12:16-24. The reason for the division was a dispute between the northern tribes (led by Jeroboam) and the southern tribes (led by Rehoboam, Solomon's son) over who would succeed Solomon as king. When Solomon died, his son Rehoboam succeeded him as king of Israel, but he ignored the counsel of the older advisors and listened instead to the young men who had grown up with him. This led to a rebellion in the north, which resulted in the division of the kingdom.

The Kingdom of Israel was ruled by Jeroboam's dynasty for 209 years until it was conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BC (2 Kings 17:1-23). The Kingdom of Judah continued to exist until its capital city, Jerusalem, was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BC, as recorded in 2 Kings 25:1-21.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the division of the Kingdom of Israel following King Solomon's reign, including key figures and timelines. It accurately highlights the dispute between the northern and southern tribes, leading to the split into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah. The scriptural references add depth to the explanation within a Christian worldview perspective. However, there could have been additional mention of the spiritual implications of this division and how it reflected the Israelites' relationship with God, which would have further enriched the response.
