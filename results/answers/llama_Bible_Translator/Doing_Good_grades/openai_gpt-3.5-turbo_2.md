## [Answer](../Doing_Good.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The phrase "do good to" (Greek: ποιμαίνω, poimainō) in the New Testament typically carries a connotation of serving or guiding someone under God's authority, rather than simply performing charitable acts. This concept is rooted in Old Testament Hebrew language and culture.

In a Christian context, "doing good to" implies a responsibility to care for others as part of being a servant (or steward) of God. As believers, we are called to live out our faith by showing compassion, kindness, and love to those around us. This can involve acts of charity, but also goes beyond mere philanthropy.

In 1 Corinthians 4:2, the apostle Paul writes that he is accountable to God for how he "nourishes" (or guides) his churches, implying a sense of spiritual responsibility. Similarly, Jesus commands His followers in Matthew 25:31-46 to care for the hungry, thirsty, stranger, naked, sick, and imprisoned – not just as acts of charity, but as an expression of their love and obedience to Him.

When we "do good to" others within a Christian context, it means we are acting as God's instruments, serving them in ways that reflect His character. This service is not primarily about earning salvation or gaining favor with God, but rather about demonstrating our love for Him by loving our neighbors as ourselves (Mark 12:30-31).

In summary, "doing good to" within a Christian context implies a sense of spiritual responsibility and servanthood, where we care for others under God's authority as an expression of our love and obedience to Him.
