## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
A great question!

The Bible teaches that humanity was entrusted by God with a responsibility to exercise dominion over the earth, as recorded in Genesis 1:28-30:

"Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.' So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. And God blessed them and said to them, 'Be fruitful and increase; fill the water in the seas and the birds in the sky; and let the creatures that move along the ground increase. Be fruitful and increase; populate the earth abundantly.'"

This passage emphasizes humanity's unique responsibility as God's image-bearers (Genesis 1:26-27) to steward the creation, including the land, sea, air, and all living creatures. This dominion is not a license for humans to exploit or abuse the natural world, but rather a call to responsible care and management.

In biblical language, "dominion" (Hebrew: רָדָה, rādâ) means "to rule over" or "to exercise authority." This term is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe God's own dominion over the universe (e.g., Psalm 8:6; Matthew 28:18).

The concept of dominion is closely tied to humanity's role as God's image-bearers. As those created in God's likeness, humans are called to reflect His character and values, including responsible care for the creation.

Throughout the Bible, we see examples of humans exercising their dominion over the earth in a way that honors God:

* In Genesis 2:15, Adam is given responsibility to till and keep the Garden of Eden.
* In Psalm 104:25-26, David describes God's providence over all living creatures, including humans.
* In Matthew 6:26, Jesus teaches that humans are not more valuable than other creatures because they are all part of God's creation.

However, Scripture also warns against abusing this dominion. Examples include:

* The consequences of humanity's rebellion against God, resulting in environmental degradation and ecological imbalance (Genesis 3; Romans 8:19-22).
* The destruction of the earth through human greed, pride, and disobedience (Matthew 24:7; Revelation 18:1-4).

In conclusion, the Bible teaches that humanity has a sacred responsibility to exercise dominion over the earth in a way that honors God. This includes responsible care for the natural world, reflection of God's character and values, and a recognition of our place within the creation.
