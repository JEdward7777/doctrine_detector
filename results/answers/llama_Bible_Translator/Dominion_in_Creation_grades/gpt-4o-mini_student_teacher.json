  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough and detailed explanation of humanity's role in having dominion over the earth, drawing from relevant biblical passages and highlighting the importance of responsible stewardship. The inclusion of examples from both the Old and New Testaments demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The connection made between humanity's role as image-bearers and the concept of dominion is well articulated. The only minor improvement could be a more concise presentation without losing any key points. Overall, an excellent response."
