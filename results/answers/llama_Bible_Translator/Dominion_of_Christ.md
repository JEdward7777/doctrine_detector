What a wonderful question!

In the Bible, Jesus Christ's dominion is extensively described as universal and eternal. Here are some key passages that highlight His dominion:

1. Psalm 72:8-11 - This psalm prophesies about the Messiah's kingdom, stating that all nations will be blessed through Him and that His dominion will reach from sea to sea.

2. Daniel 7:13-14 - In this apocalyptic vision, Daniel sees a figure resembling a human being coming with the clouds of heaven and receiving dominion over all nations.

3. Luke 1:31-33 - The angel Gabriel announces Jesus' birth by saying that He will be given the throne of David and that His kingdom will never end.

4. John 12:31-32 - Jesus Himself says, "Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself."

5. Revelation 1:5,9; 11:15 - Jesus is described as the one who holds the seven stars and the seven golden lampstands (Rev. 1:12-20), indicating His authority over the entire universe.

6. Hebrews 2:8 - This passage states that Jesus, for a little while, was made lower than the angels, but now He has been crowned with glory and honor by God, having received a position of highest honor above all others.

7. Colossians 1:15-20 - Paul writes about Jesus being the firstborn of all creation, created everything, and holding everything together. This emphasizes His universal dominion over all things.

8. Revelation 11:17; 19:6 - The seven thunders announce that the kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and that He will reign forever and ever.

These passages illustrate Jesus' dominion as encompassing the entire universe, including heaven, earth, and all creation. His kingdom is not limited to a specific time or place but is eternal and universal.
