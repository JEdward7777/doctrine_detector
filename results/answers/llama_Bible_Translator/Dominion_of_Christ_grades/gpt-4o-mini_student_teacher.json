  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of Jesus Christ's dominion as described in the Bible through various key passages. They effectively highlighted His universal and eternal dominion over all aspects of creation. However, the student could improve their answer by linking these descriptions to the specific roles of prophet, priest, and king that Jesus fulfills in His dominion as indicated in the provided reference answer. Making this connection would have enhanced the understanding of how recognizing the authority of Christ in all aspects of life impacts our faith."
