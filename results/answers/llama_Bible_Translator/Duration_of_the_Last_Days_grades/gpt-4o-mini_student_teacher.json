However, while the student did highlight that the exact duration of \"the last days\" is unknown, there could have been more emphasis on the importance of this uncertainty in shaping Christians' anticipation and preparedness for Christ's return, as mentioned in the specified concern. The response could have been strengthened by tying the theological implications of uncertainty to the practical application in living out one's faith in readiness for Christ's return."
