  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive biblical explanation regarding the duration of \"the last days\" and addresses the concern about how this uncertainty can impact Christians' faith and readiness for Christ's return. The integration of relevant Bible verses and theological insights from a Christian worldview is thorough and insightful. The response could have been enhanced by further emphasizing the importance of faithfulness and obedience in light of the uncertain timeline, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
