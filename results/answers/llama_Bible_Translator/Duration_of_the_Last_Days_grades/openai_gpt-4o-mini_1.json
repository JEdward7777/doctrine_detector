The acknowledgment of the unknown duration, supported by scriptural evidence, is well articulated. The response appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of readiness and faithfulness in light of the uncertainty surrounding Christ's return. Overall, a strong Christian worldview perspective is evident in the response."
