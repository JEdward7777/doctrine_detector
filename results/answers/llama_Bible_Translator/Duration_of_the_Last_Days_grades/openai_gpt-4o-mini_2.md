What a great question!

In the Bible, the term "the last days" (or "the end times") refers to the period of time that begins with Jesus Christ's ascension and will continue until His return. The exact duration is not explicitly stated in Scripture.

However, we can glean some insights from various passages:

1. Peter writes that God has spoken once, but twice, and yet again (Acts 3:22-24). This suggests that the prophetic period, including the "last days," may be a prolonged period of time.
2. Jesus says that the end will come like a thief in the night (Matthew 24:43), implying suddenness rather than a specific duration.
3. The apostle Paul writes that the day of the Lord will be like a thief in the night, and we are to be prepared at all times (1 Thessalonians 5:2-4).
4. In 2 Peter 3:8-9, Peter mentions that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and yet it's as if one were falling short of another day. This could imply that time is not linear in God's perspective, making it difficult to pinpoint an exact duration.

While we can't determine the precise duration of "the last days," we can be assured that they are characterized by:

* Increased apostasy (2 Timothy 3:1-5)
* Persecution (Matthew 24:9-12)
* Wars and rumors of wars (Matthew 24:6-7)
* Earthquakes, famines, and pestilences (Luke 21:10-11)

As believers, we are called to be watchful and ready at all times, just as a servant is always prepared for their master's return (Luke 12:35-40).
