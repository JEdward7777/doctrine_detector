  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 85. The student provided a thorough analysis of the story of Gideon and the creation of the golden ephod, drawing out important lessons such as the dangers of idolatry, the importance of God's jealousy, the consequences of compromise, and the power of repentance. The student effectively tied these lessons to the overall theme of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith. However, the student could have more directly linked their analysis back to the specific concern about the importance of focusing on God rather than being distracted by material representations of faith. By doing so, the response could have been more explicitly aligned with the given answer from the teacher."
