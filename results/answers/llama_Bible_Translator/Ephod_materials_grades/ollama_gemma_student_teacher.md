According to Exodus 28:6-12, the high priest's ephod was constructed using various materials. The instructions given by God to Moses and Aaron are as follows:

* The foundation of the ephod was made of gold, twisted together with blue, purple, and scarlet yarns.
* It had two shoulder pieces attached at the two ends of the foundation, connected with a single piece of gold cord.
* These shoulder pieces were adorned with twelve precious stones, three rows of four stones each, representing the tribes of Israel. The stones were:
	+ Three rows of emeralds for Reuben, Simeon, and Levi
	+ Three rows of onyx stones for Judah, Dan, and Gad
	+ Three rows of jacinth stones for Asher, Naphtali, and Manasseh
* The ephod was further decorated with intricate gold work, including a golden rim around the hem and golden clasps in the form of cherubim.
* On the breastpiece (or apron) of the high priest's ephod, there were twelve more precious stones, arranged in four rows of three stones each. These stones represented the tribes of Israel again.

In summary, the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod included:

1. Gold
2. Blue yarn
3. Purple yarn
4. Scarlet yarn
5. Precious stones (emeralds, onyx, jacinth)
6. Gold cord

These materials were carefully chosen to reflect the glory and majesty of God, as well as the high priest's role as a mediator between God and humanity.
