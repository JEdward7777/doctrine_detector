The understanding of the significance behind each material chosen demonstrates a strong comprehension of the ephod's design and symbolism within the context of worship. The reference to the ephod's role in highlighting the mediatorship of the high priest between God and humanity aligns well with a Christian worldview. Great job in connecting the specific materials to the broader spiritual significance of the ephod."
