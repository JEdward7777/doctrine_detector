They highlighted key aspects such as the representation of God's presence, the priestly ministry, connection to God's glory, and unique identity. However, the student did not address the specific concern of how understanding the role of the ephod helps in comprehending the Old Testament priesthood and worship practices. Overall, a strong answer with comprehensive insights that align well with a Christian worldview."
