  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of the high priest's ephod in Old Testament worship. The student provides well-articulated explanations of the ephod's symbolic representation, priestly function, connection to God's glory, and unique identity. The inclusion of relevant references from Exodus and Leviticus further strengthens the student's arguments. However, the response could benefit from additional insight into the practical use of the Urim and Thummim attached to the breastpiece."
