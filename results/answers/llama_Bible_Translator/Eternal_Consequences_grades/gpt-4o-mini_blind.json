  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the concept of \"perishing\" in Scripture and provides appropriate references to support the explanation. It is doctrinally sound, emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for eternal life and contrasting it with the consequences of rejecting Him. The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian teachings on salvation and judgment. Great job overall."
