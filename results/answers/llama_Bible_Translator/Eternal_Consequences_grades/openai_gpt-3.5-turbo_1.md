## [Answer](../Eternal_Consequences.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I must emphasize that the concept of "perishing" in Scripture refers specifically to those who reject God's offer of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.

In John 3:16-18, Jesus clearly states that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life. The opposite is also true: whoever does not believe in Him will perish (Greek: apollymi). This phrase "perish" or "to perish" carries the sense of being separated from God, experiencing His righteous judgment, and ultimately facing eternal punishment.

In Matthew 10:28, Jesus says that those who do not receive Him are worthy of eternal destruction. Similarly, in Revelation 20:15, it is written that death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire, which is also the second death. This lake represents the eternal punishment reserved for those who reject God's offer of salvation.

The Bible teaches that those who perish will be separated from God forever, experiencing a state of spiritual darkness, isolation, and suffering. In Matthew 25:46, Jesus describes this state as "eternal fire" prepared for the devil and his angels. This eternal punishment is not a temporary or retributive justice but an eternal state of being, separate from God's presence and love.

It's essential to emphasize that this perishing is not because of who we are by nature (Ephesians 2:3), but rather because of our choice to reject God's offer of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The good news is that those who put their faith in Him will never perish, but have eternal life and dwell with God forever (John 17:3).
