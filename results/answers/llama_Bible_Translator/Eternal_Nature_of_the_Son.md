## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I'd like to emphasize that the term "Son of God" (Greek: υἱός τοῦ θεοῦ; Hebrew: בֶן-אֵל) is not just a title or a metaphorical description, but it carries profound implications for our understanding of Jesus Christ's nature and existence.

In contrast to human sons, who are finite beings born of human parents and subject to the limitations of time and mortality, the Son of God possesses an eternal and essential existence. This means that:

1. He has no beginning: The Bible teaches that Jesus is the "eternal Son" (Hebrews 13:8), implying that His existence is not bound by a starting point or a beginning. In other words, there was never a time when He did not exist.
2. He is co-eternal with God the Father: As the second person of the Trinity, Jesus shares an eternal relationship with God the Father, as testified in the Bible (John 1:1-3; Hebrews 1:2).
3. His existence is essential and necessary: The Son's existence is not contingent upon any other being or event, unlike human sons who come into existence through procreation. Instead, Jesus' existence is inherent to God's very nature.
4. He possesses an eternal consciousness: As the Son of God, Jesus has always been conscious of His divine identity and purpose, unlike human sons whose self-awareness develops over time.

These distinctions highlight the unique nature of the Son of God, which is distinct from humanity's finite and mortal existence. In Christian theology, this understanding of Jesus' eternal and essential existence forms the foundation for our comprehension of His role in salvation history and His identity as the only-begotten Son (John 1:14).
