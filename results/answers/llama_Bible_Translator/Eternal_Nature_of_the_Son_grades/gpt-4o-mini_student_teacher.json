  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the distinctions between the Son of God and human sons in terms of existence and eternal nature. The student effectively emphasizes the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God, grounding their response in biblical references and Christian theology. The only small improvement could be the direct mention of the Son of God's active role in creation, as highlighted in the reference answer."
