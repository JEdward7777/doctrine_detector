  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of how eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice in response to rebellion and rejection of salvation through Jesus Christ. The detailed analysis shows a clear understanding of the Christian perspective on divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. The integration of biblical references and theological principles strengthens the argument presented. A very strong response overall."
