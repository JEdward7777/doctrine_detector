It addresses the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy by emphasizing the consequences of sin, the accountability required by justice, God's perfect justice, the gravity of sin, the value of redemption through Jesus, the purpose of hell, and the hope of salvation. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively presents a nuanced understanding of eternal consequences in relation to divine justice and mercy."
