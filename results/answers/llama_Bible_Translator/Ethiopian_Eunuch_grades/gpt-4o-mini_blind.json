The student effectively highlights key theological implications, such as the expansion of Christianity beyond Jewish circles, the inclusivity of salvation, the empowerment of the Holy Spirit, the importance of Scripture in evangelism, the establishment of the Church among Gentiles, and the virtues of humility and obedience. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the passage and its broader implications within the early church. Great job!"
