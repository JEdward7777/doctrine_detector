  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-analyzed answer to the question, highlighting various important aspects of the encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch in the context of the early church. The response effectively addresses the significance of the encounter in terms of expanding Christianity beyond Jewish circles, emphasizing inclusivity, empowering the Holy Spirit, utilizing Scripture in evangelism, establishing the Church among Gentiles, and illustrating humility and obedience. While the answer is detailed and presents a strong Christian worldview, it goes beyond the reference answer by delving into additional insights and implications of the encounter. The student effectively connects the encounter to broader theological themes and implications for the early church's mission."
