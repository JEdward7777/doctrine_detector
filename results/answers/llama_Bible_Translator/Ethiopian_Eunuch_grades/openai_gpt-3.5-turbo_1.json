The focus on themes of inclusiveness, empowerment of the Holy Spirit, importance of Scripture, and establishment of the Church among Gentiles aligns well with the concern for recognizing the diverse backgrounds of individuals in the early church. The integration of relevant scripture references further strengthens the argument and offers a solid foundation for the importance of this event in shaping early Christian teachings and practices."
