The understanding of the expansion of the Gospel to Gentiles, the role of the Holy Spirit in evangelism, the importance of Scripture, and the themes of humility and obedience are all well-articulated and supported by relevant biblical references. The response effectively addresses the concern with a deep exploration of the theological implications of the event."
