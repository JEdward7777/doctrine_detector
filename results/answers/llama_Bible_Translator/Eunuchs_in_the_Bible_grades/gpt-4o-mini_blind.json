The explanation of the different types of eunuchs and the historical context is well done. The connection to celibacy as a form of devotion to God is effectively explained. However, the response could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of celibacy within the framework of Christian teachings on marriage, rather than presenting it as an individual choice without a stronger doctrinal basis. Additionally, reiterating the biblical teaching that celibacy is a gift and not a requirement for all would further align the response with Christian beliefs on this topic."
