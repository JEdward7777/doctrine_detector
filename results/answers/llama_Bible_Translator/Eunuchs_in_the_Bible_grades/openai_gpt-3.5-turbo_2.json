The explanation is nuanced and aligned with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the voluntary choice of celibacy for the kingdom of heaven's sake. The response appropriately highlights that celibacy is a valid but not mandatory path for Christians, encouraging careful discernment and consultation with spiritual authorities. Overall, the analysis is well-supported and addresses the concern effectively."
