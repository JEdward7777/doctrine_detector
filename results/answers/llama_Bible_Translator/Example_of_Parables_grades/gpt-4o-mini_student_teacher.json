  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed analysis of the Parable of the Sower, highlighting its significance in terms of hearing and responding to God's message, the dangers of spiritual superficiality, and the importance of avoiding distractions and worldly concerns. The explanation was thorough and incorporated relevant Bible verses to support their points. However, the student should have focused more on the assigned parable, the Good Samaritan, to fully address the question asked."
