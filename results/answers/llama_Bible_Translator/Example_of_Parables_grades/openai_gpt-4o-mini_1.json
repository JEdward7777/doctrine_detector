  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough analysis of the Parable of the Sower, highlighting key lessons on hearing and responding to God's message, the dangers of spiritual superficiality, the distractions of worldly concerns, and the sovereignty of God in salvation. The student effectively connects the parable to moral lessons that are relevant in today's context. The only improvement could be to link the Parable of the Sower to the Good Samaritan parable, showing how both emphasize love, compassion, and the importance of a genuine response to God's teachings."
