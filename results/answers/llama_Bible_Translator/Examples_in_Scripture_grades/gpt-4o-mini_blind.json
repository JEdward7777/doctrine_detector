However, the answer seems to lean more towards a metaphorical understanding of demon possession rather than acknowledging the reality of demonic influence. To improve, the student could delve deeper into the biblical teaching on spiritual warfare and the authority of Jesus over demons, balancing both metaphorical and literal interpretations of demon possession in Scripture."
