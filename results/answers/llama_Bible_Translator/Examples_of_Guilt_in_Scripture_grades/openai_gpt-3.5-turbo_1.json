It effectively connects these examples to the theme of guilt in the context of justice, innocence, and divine judgment. The additional example provided further supports the discussion on guilt and innocence. Overall, a solid analysis from a Christian worldview on the importance of recognizing guilt as a precursor to seeking forgiveness."
