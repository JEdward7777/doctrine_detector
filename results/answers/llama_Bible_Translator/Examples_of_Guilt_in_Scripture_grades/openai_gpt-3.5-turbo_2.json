It successfully addresses the concern about understanding guilt in the context of justice and innocence, emphasizing the need for divine judgment. The examples chosen and the connections made demonstrate a strong understanding of guilt from a Christian worldview. However, a more explicit reflection on the ultimate resolution of guilt through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ could further strengthen the response."
