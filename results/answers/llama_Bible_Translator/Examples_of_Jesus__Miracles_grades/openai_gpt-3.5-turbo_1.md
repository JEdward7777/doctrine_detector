3. **Raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-45)**: This dramatic demonstration of Jesus' power over death and life emphasized his divinity and foreshadowed his own resurrection.
4. **Healing the blind man, Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46-52; Luke 18:35-43)**: This miracle demonstrated Jesus' authority to overcome physical and spiritual blindness, symbolizing his role as the light of the world.
