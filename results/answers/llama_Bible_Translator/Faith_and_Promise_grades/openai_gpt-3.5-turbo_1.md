## [Answer](../Faith_and_Promise.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a wonderful question!

In Genesis 15:6, it says, "Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness." This passage highlights the importance of faith in receiving and trusting God's promises. In this context, faith is not just intellectual assent or acknowledgment of God's power but rather a personal trust in His character, wisdom, and goodness.

For Abram, faith meant believing God's promise that his descendants would be numerous despite his own physical limitations (Genesis 12:2-3). It meant trusting that God's blessing would come to him even when there was no visible evidence of it. Abram's faith didn't just acknowledge God's power; it surrendered control and relied on God's sovereignty.

This type of faith is not just about understanding or knowing God's promises but also about aligning one's will with His. It involves a deep trust that God's ways are good, even when they seem impossible to us (Romans 8:28). Abram's story teaches us that faith is not just about believing in God's power but also about partnering with Him to achieve what seems humanly impossible.

In Christian theology, this type of faith is often referred to as "justification by faith" or "righteousness through faith." It's the foundation upon which our salvation rests. Jesus Himself said that Abram was counted righteous because he believed God (John 6:29; Romans 4:3). This shows us that Abram's faith wasn't just a human endeavor but rather a response to God's initiative and promise.

So, what can we learn from Abram's example?

1. Faith is not just intellectual assent; it's a personal trust in God's character, wisdom, and goodness.
2. Trusting God's promises requires surrendering control and relying on His sovereignty.
3. Faith involves aligning one's will with God's, even when things seem impossible or uncertain.
4. Justification by faith is the foundation of our salvation, as seen in Abram's example.

May we, like Abram, trust God's promises and walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7).
