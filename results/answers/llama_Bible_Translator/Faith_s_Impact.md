What a wonderful question!

As a Christian Bible translator, I believe that true faith in Jesus manifests in a person's life in several ways. Here are some key characteristics:

1. **Repentance and Surrender**: A person who has truly put their faith in Jesus has repented of their sin and surrendered their lives to Him. This involves acknowledging their sinful nature, turning away from it, and putting their trust in Jesus as the only way to be saved.
2. **Fruitful Living**: A believer's life will exhibit the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23), such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, and humility. This is not a one-time experience but an ongoing process.
3. **Obedience to God's Word**: A person who has put their trust in Jesus will seek to obey His commands (John 14:15) and live according to Scripture (Deuteronomy 28:1-2). This obedience is not a legalistic requirement but a natural response to a deepening relationship with God.
4. **Worship and Praise**: A believer's heart will be filled with worship and praise for Jesus, the Creator of heaven and earth. They will express this through prayers, songs, and testimonies (Hebrews 13:15).
5. **Relationship with Others**: Those who have put their faith in Jesus will demonstrate a love for others that reflects His character (John 13:34-35). This may involve serving, helping, or evangelizing to spread the gospel.
6. **Maturity and Maturity-Seeking**: As believers grow in their faith, they will seek spiritual maturity through prayer, study, and submission to God's Word (2 Peter 3:18).
7. **Resilience and Perseverance**: A person who has put their trust in Jesus will demonstrate resilience and perseverance in the face of trials and tribulations (James 1:2-4), knowing that these experiences can strengthen their faith.
8. **Hope and Assurance**: Ultimately, a believer's life will be characterized by hope and assurance in eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 8:1-4). This confidence is not based on human works but on God's promise of salvation.

These manifestations are not a checklist for earning salvation, but rather natural consequences of having a genuine relationship with Jesus. As believers grow in their faith, they will exhibit these characteristics more consistently and profoundly.
