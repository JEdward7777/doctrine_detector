  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of characteristics that manifest in a person's life when they have true faith in Jesus, there is a concern that their answer might be overly focused on the individual's efforts rather than emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in producing good spiritual fruits or behaviors. The student should further emphasize the importance of the Holy Spirit's work in transforming and empowering believers, rather than solely attributing the manifestations to personal actions."
