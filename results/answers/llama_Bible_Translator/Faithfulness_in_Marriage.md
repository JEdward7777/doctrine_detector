## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
A vital question that gets to the heart of God's design for human relationships and His expectations for our behavior. The Bible teaches that faithfulness in marriage is a fundamental aspect of marital commitment, and adultery is considered a grave violation of this commitment.

In Scripture, God establishes the institution of marriage (Genesis 2:24) and defines its purpose as a lifelong union between one man and one woman (Matthew 19:4-6). He also sets boundaries for what is acceptable behavior within this institution. Specifically, God commands husbands to love their wives as Christ loves the church (Ephesians 5:25), and wives to submit to their husbands as unto the Lord (Ephesians 5:22).

Regarding adultery, Scripture is clear:

* The tenth commandment states, "You shall not commit adultery" (Exodus 20:17). This commandment reinforces the moral imperative to remain faithful in marriage.
* Jesus affirms this commandment and takes it a step further by teaching that lustful thinking towards someone other than one's spouse constitutes adultery (Matthew 5:27-28).
* The apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of sexual purity within marriage, warning against immorality and adultery (1 Corinthians 6:15-16; Ephesians 5:3).

In summary, the Bible teaches that faithfulness in marriage is a non-negotiable aspect of marital commitment. Adultery, whether physical or spiritual, is considered a grave betrayal of one's spouse and God, and is therefore morally wrong.

As Christians, we are called to prioritize our marriages and demonstrate Christ-like love and loyalty to our spouses. This involves not only abstaining from adultery but also cultivating a deep sense of commitment, trust, and respect for our partners.
