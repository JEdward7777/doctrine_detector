  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns closely with the Christian worldview on faithfulness in marriage and adultery. They effectively reference relevant scriptures and teachings to emphasize the importance of maintaining integrity and faithfulness in marriages. The only slight deviation is the use of \"physical or spiritual\" adultery, which is not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, an excellent response."
