  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid and comprehensive answer that delves into various aspects of faithfulness to God according to the biblical definition. They showed a good understanding of the concept in both the Old and New Testaments, supported their points with relevant scripture references, and emphasized key principles such as obedience, loyalty, trust, and reflecting God's character. The student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer but expounds on the topic in a more detailed manner."
