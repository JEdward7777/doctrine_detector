It accurately captures the idea that finding favor with someone reflects approval and a positive relationship. Additionally, it aligns well with the Christian concern of cultivating relationships characterized by mutual approval and blessing. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly tie in the importance of seeking God's favor above all else in relationships."
