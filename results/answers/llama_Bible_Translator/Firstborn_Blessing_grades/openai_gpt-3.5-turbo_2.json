It effectively expands on the given answer and addresses the concern by discussing various aspects such as primogeniture, spiritual inheritance, stewardship, family roles, spiritual DNA, equality in Christ, and submission and humility. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian principles and effectively relates them to family dynamics and spiritual responsibilities. Great job overall."
