  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concepts of predestination and foreordination within Christian theology, particularly in the Reformed tradition. The student effectively distinguishes between the two terms and articulates how they relate to each other, with clear and relevant examples. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of these theological concepts, albeit with minor room for improvement in clarity and conciseness. Overall, this is a solid explanation with a solid grade."
