  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and comprehensive explanation of the terms \"foreordination\" and \"predestination\" in Christian theology, highlighting the differences in scope and emphasizing God's sovereignty. The student effectively illustrated the relationship between the two terms and demonstrated a strong understanding of the theological concepts. However, the student's response could have been improved by aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer, which succinctly clarified the emphasis on God's authority in the plan of foreordination."
