## [Answer](../Foreordain_vs_Predestine.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The terms "foreordain" and "predestine" are closely related in Christian theology, particularly in the Reformed tradition. Both terms refer to God's sovereign plan or decree that determines the course of human history and the ultimate salvation of believers.

In Christian theology, predestination (or predestine) refers specifically to God's eternal and unchangeable decision to save certain individuals through faith in Jesus Christ. This doctrine is often linked to Calvinism and emphasizes that salvation is solely due to God's sovereign choice, without any consideration of human works or merits. Predestination is seen as a demonstration of God's sovereignty over all things, including human decisions and actions.

Foreordination, on the other hand, has a broader scope than predestination. It refers to God's general plan or decree that governs the entire universe, including both believers and non-believers. Foreordination encompasses not only salvation but also the creation of the world, the fall of humanity, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.

In this sense, foreordination is a more comprehensive term that includes predestination as a specific aspect of God's plan. While predestination focuses on the election of believers to eternal life, foreordination encompasses all of God's sovereign purposes and actions in human history.

To illustrate the relationship between the two terms:

* Predestination: God has predetermined which individuals will be saved through faith in Jesus Christ.
* Foreordination: God has decreed the overall course of human history, including the fall of humanity, the revelation of His plan of salvation, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.

In summary, foreordination is a broader concept that includes predestination as one aspect of God's sovereign plan. While both terms emphasize God's sovereignty, foreordination has a more comprehensive scope, encompassing all of God's actions in human history, including creation, the fall, redemption, and ultimate victory.
