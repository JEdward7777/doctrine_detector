The student effectively addresses the hindrances that sin causes in a Christian's relationship with God, and then offers a detailed and doctrinally sound approach to obtaining freedom through Christ. The integration of Scripture passages and key principles of the Christian faith enhances the credibility and depth of the answer. Great job!"
