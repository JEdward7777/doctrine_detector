  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that addresses the question thoroughly from a Christian perspective. They effectively discussed the ways in which sin can hinder a Christian's relationship with God and offered detailed steps for finding freedom from those bonds through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. The biblical references and principles used to support their points were appropriate and relevant. However, the student could have tied their conclusion back more closely to the reference answer provided by emphasizing the theme of fulfilling God's purposes for one's life through freedom and restoration."
