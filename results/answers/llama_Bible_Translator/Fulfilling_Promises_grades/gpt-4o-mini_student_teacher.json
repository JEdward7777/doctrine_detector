  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-reasoned answer that effectively addresses the significance of keeping promises and vows before God from a Christian perspective. They integrated relevant biblical verses and principles to support their points and highlighted the importance of reflecting God's character through integrity and obedience. The student's response aligns closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher, but their detailed explanation and in-depth exploration of the topic warrant a high grade."
