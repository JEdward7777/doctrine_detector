  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95/100\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of what it means for a prophecy to be fulfilled according to Biblical teaching. The student effectively outlines the types of prophecies, the elements involved in their fulfillment, and the theological significance of fulfilled prophecies. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the role of the Holy Spirit in inspiring and guiding the fulfillment of prophecies, as this is an important aspect within Christian theology."
