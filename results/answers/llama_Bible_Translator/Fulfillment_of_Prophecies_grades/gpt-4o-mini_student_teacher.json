  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer regarding the fulfillment of prophecies according to Biblical teaching. They accurately discussed the significance, types, elements, and purposes of fulfilled prophecies within a Christian worldview. However, the student's answer could have strengthened by emphasizing more prominently that the fulfillment of prophecies ultimately occurs through God's intervention and sovereignty, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
