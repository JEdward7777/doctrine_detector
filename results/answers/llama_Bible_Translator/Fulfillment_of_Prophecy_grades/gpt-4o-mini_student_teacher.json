  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the significance of fulfilled prophecies in the Christian faith. They effectively highlighted various reasons why fulfilled prophecies are essential, including validating Scripture, proving God's sovereignty, authenticating Messianic prophecies, and serving as a source of encouragement and comfort for believers. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the central theme of God's sovereignty and faithfulness in relation to fulfilled prophecies, as emphasized in the reference answer. Streamlining the response to center more on this core aspect would strengthen the alignment with a Christian worldview."
