  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out and comprehensive answer, demonstrating a good understanding of expanding the concept of \"holy place\" beyond physical locations. They effectively linked Biblical references to support their points and offered insightful interpretations. The student's response aligns with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the sacredness of different aspects of life dedicated to spiritual significance and divine encounter. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of setting apart these places for God and worship, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response."
