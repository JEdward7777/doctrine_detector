What a great question!

In the Hebrew Bible, the concept of "holy place" (Hebrew: מְקוֹדֶשׁ, mikdash) is often associated with the Tabernacle and Temple in Jerusalem. However, we can broaden our understanding of this term to include other sacred spaces and experiences that reflect God's presence and glory.

Here are some ways to understand "holy place" beyond the literal tabernacle or temple:

1. The Church as a holy place: In the New Testament, the early church is referred to as a "temple" (1 Corinthians 3:16-17; Ephesians 2:20-22) and a "holy place" (Hebrews 9:11-12). This emphasizes that believers' hearts are temples of God's Spirit.
2. The heart as a holy place: Jesus taught that the heart is where worship takes place, not just physical locations. In Mark 7:15-16, He says, "What goes into someone's mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth does... It is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts and wicked schemes originate."
3. The community as a holy place: When believers gather in Jesus' name, they become a sacred space for worship, fellowship, and ministry (Matthew 18:20). This understanding highlights the importance of community in experiencing God's presence.
4. Personal experiences as holy places: Conversion, baptism, or other significant spiritual experiences can be considered "holy places" where individuals encounter God's power and presence.
5. The world as a holy place (in a sense): As followers of Jesus, we are called to see the world as God's creation and a sacred space for mission and ministry. This perspective recognizes that all people are precious to God and deserving of love and respect.

In conclusion, while the original context of "holy place" refers to specific physical locations, we can broaden our understanding to include other spaces where God is present, such as the church, hearts, communities, personal experiences, and even the world itself. This expanded perspective encourages us to seek and honor God's presence in all aspects of life.
