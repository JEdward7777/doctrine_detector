  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of various ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily lives, rooted in biblical principles. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of living a life that honors God's greatness through practical examples and scriptural references. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie back each point to the overarching theme of reflecting God's glory to others, as mentioned in the provided answer. Overall, this response offers a strong biblical framework for glorifying God in daily living."
