  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the context and meaning behind Jesus' statement in Luke 18:19. The student accurately explains that Jesus' statement emphasizes the unique goodness of God and the fallen nature of humanity. The response also effectively ties in key principles of Christian theology, such as human sinfulness and the need for God's grace. The only area for improvement could be to potentially include a clearer distinction between the humanity and divinity of Jesus in relation to goodness, emphasizing the doctrinal implications of Christ's nature. Overall, a well-explained and doctrinally sound response."
