  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained analysis of the passage in Luke 18:19 and its implications for recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. The response accurately captures the context of Jesus' statement and its theological significance within a Christian worldview. However, the student's answer could be strengthened by more directly connecting Jesus' statement to the teacher's reference answer, which emphasizes God's moral perfection and righteousness as the ultimate standard of goodness. Overall, a solid interpretation with room for slight improvement in alignment with the specific concern addressed."
