## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In Luke 18:19, Jesus says, "Why do you call me good? No one is good—except God alone." This statement is often misunderstood to imply that Jesus is claiming to be God or that He is not good. However, a closer examination of the context and Jesus' statements elsewhere in Scripture reveals a different meaning.

In this passage, Jesus is being questioned by a scholar who wants to justify himself before God. The scholar asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus responds by quoting Deuteronomy 6:17 and Leviticus 19:18, emphasizing the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself. The scholar, feeling proud of his own righteous behavior, says that he has kept all these commandments since his youth.

Jesus' response is not a declaration of His own goodness, but rather an affirmation that only God is truly good and that humans are not capable of being good in the same way. Jesus is pointing out that human beings are prone to self-justification and pride, which stems from our sinful nature (Romans 3:12). As such, we cannot claim to be good in and of ourselves.

In this context, Jesus' statement "No one is good—except God alone" is not a declaration of His own goodness but rather an affirmation that only God, who is holy and just, can truly be considered good. This emphasis on the absolute goodness of God is central to Christian theology and serves as a reminder of our dependence on Him.

In other words, Jesus is saying that there is no human being who can claim to be good in the same way that God is good. Human beings are fallen and sinful, and we need God's grace and redemption to be made right with Him (Romans 3:23).

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 95.

The response accurately identifies the passage's emphasis on God's moral perfection and righteousness as the ultimate standard of goodness, which aligns well with the given answer. Additionally, it provides a clear explanation of Jesus' statement in Luke 18:19, highlighting its context and significance within Christian theology.

Regarding the concern about recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs, the response effectively shows how Jesus' statement points to God as the sole source of goodness, underscoring humanity's dependence on Him. This understanding is crucial for Christian discipleship, as it highlights the importance of submitting one's life to God's will and seeking His guidance.

The only area where this response could improve is in providing more explicit connections between Jesus' statement and its implications for everyday life or personal spirituality. However, overall, this response demonstrates a strong grasp of biblical theology and a thoughtful consideration of the passage's message.
