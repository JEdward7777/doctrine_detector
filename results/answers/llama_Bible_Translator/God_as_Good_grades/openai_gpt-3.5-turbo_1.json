The explanation is detailed, well-supported with references from Scripture, and aligns with Christian theological perspectives on God's ultimate goodness and human sinfulness. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the role of Jesus as the mediator between God's perfection and our fallen nature, underscoring the need for His redemptive work in our lives."
