  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a strong analysis of the passage in Luke 18:19 within a Christian worldview, emphasizing the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness. It effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs by highlighting the distinction between God's inherent goodness and human fallenness. The explanation is clear, well-supported with relevant biblical references, and aligns well with the Christian perspective."
