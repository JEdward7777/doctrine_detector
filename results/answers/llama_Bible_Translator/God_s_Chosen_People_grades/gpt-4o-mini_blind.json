  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a well-explained and detailed exploration of the concept of a \"remnant\" in biblical theology, highlighting various examples from both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively connects the idea of the remnant with God's selective grace, emphasizing God's sovereignty, faithfulness, and redemptive purpose. The response could have been strengthened by incorporating more direct scriptural references to support the points made and deepen the analysis further. Overall, a strong and insightful reflection on the topic."
