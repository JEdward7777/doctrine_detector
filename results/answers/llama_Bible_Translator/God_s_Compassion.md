The Bible reveals that God's nature is characterized by compassion, empathy, and tender-heartedness towards His people. Here are some key passages that demonstrate God's compassionate nature:

1. Psalm 136:23-25 says, "Praise the Lord, who forgives all your sins; who heals your diseases, who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with love and compassion." This passage highlights God's loving and compassionate character towards His people.

2. Isaiah 63:7-9 describes God as a compassionate Father who remembers His children and their sufferings. It says, "I will show you my faithfulness. I will be faithful to you and multiply your descendants. You shall rebuild the ancient ruins and restore those destroyed long ago. If you forget me or don't mention my name Jerusalem, how can it succeed? Can it not be saved? But if you acknowledge your guilt, confess your sin, and do what is right, then I will return your plundered inheritance. I will give justice to those who have been robbed." This passage emphasizes God's concern for His people's well-being and His desire to bring redemption and restoration.

3. Jeremiah 31:20 says, "Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he my beloved child? For as often as I speak against him, I also will remember him greatly; therefore I will not relent concerning him." This passage highlights God's deep affection for Israel and His desire to bring them back to Himself.

4. Matthew 9:36 says, "When Jesus saw the people crowding around him, he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless â€“ like sheep without a shepherd." This passage shows that even when Jesus was under pressure and surrounded by crowds, He still had time for those in need of compassion and care.

5. Hebrews 4:15-16 says, "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way that we are, yet remained without sin. Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need." This passage emphasizes Jesus' ability to understand and empathize with His people's struggles.

In summary, the Bible portrays God as a compassionate Father who cares deeply for His children, remembers their sufferings, and desires to bring redemption and restoration. Jesus, as the Son of God, is also characterized by compassion towards those in need.
