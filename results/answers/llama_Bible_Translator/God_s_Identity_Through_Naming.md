What a beautiful and profound question!

In biblical theology, the concept of being "called by your name" speaks to the intimate and personal nature of our relationship with God. It's a theme that appears in various forms throughout Scripture.

One of the most significant examples is found in Isaiah 45:4 (NIV), which states:

"Since you are precious and honored—
though not reproached, or your esteem has continued—
because you have been called by name;
you are not destroyed."

Here, God affirms Israel's uniqueness and significance, emphasizing that they were "called by name." This phrase conveys a sense of personal recognition, as if God has taken the time to get to know each individual personally.

This concept is also seen in Jeremiah 1:5 (NIV), where God says:

"Before I formed you in the womb,
I knew you;
and before you were born
I sanctified you.
And I appointed you a prophet
to the nations."

Here, God describes His knowledge and intentionality regarding Jeremiah's life even before his birth. The phrase "before I formed you in the womb" implies that God had a specific plan for Jeremiah's existence, and that he was known by name even before he took his first breath.

The idea of being "called by your name" reflects our relationship with God in several ways:

1. **Personal connection**: It highlights the personal nature of our relationship with God. He knows us intimately, down to our individual names and unique circumstances.
2. **Predestination**: The concept implies that God has a plan for each person's life, including those who are called by name. This understanding underscores the idea of predestination, where God has chosen us for a specific purpose.
3. **Sanctification**: When we're "called by name," it implies that we've been set apart (sanctified) for God's purposes. This sets us apart from the world and gives us a distinct identity as followers of Christ.
4. **Purpose**: Being "called by name" suggests that each person has a unique role to play in God's plan. We're not just generic individuals; we have specific gifts, talents, and responsibilities that are meant to be used for His glory.

In summary, the concept of being "called by your name" reflects our relationship with God as a deeply personal, predestined, sanctified, and purpose-filled connection. It's a beautiful reminder that each person is uniquely known and loved by their Creator.
