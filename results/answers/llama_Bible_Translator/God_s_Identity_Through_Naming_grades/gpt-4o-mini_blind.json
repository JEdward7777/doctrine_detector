The student effectively integrates relevant biblical references and theological insights to support their points. The explanation of the personal connection, predestination, sanctification, and purpose associated with being called by name is well articulated and aligns with Christian doctrine. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the role of God's sovereignty in this relationship, ensuring that His will and authority are central to the discussion."
