  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a deep and thorough analysis of God's intentional nature in calling individuals, drawing on biblical examples and theological insights to support the idea that God's call is deliberate and purposeful. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the intentionality of God's interaction with humanity and provides a comprehensive explanation of how this intentional nature reflects God's sovereign agency, specific plans for individuals, uniqueness of human experience, and the value of human agency. The integration of biblical references further strengthens the argument, making it a well-rounded and insightful response from a Christian worldview."
