The use of scriptural references, such as Exodus 20:5-6 and Deuteronomy 4:23-24, adds to the explanation's credibility. The answer effectively conveys that God's jealousy stems from His desire for His people to remain faithful to Him alone. Overall, a well-done response with doctrinal correctness and clarity."
