The student not only provides a clear explanation of God's jealousy in relation to His covenant people but also supports their points with relevant Biblical references. The response effectively conveys the deep love and commitment God has for His people, emphasizing the importance of remaining faithful to Him alone. Overall, this is a strong theological reflection on the concept of divine jealousy."
