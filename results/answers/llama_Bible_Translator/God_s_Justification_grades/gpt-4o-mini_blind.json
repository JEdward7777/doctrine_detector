It correctly outlines the theological concept based on Scripture and emphasizes the foundational role of faith in Jesus Christ for believers to be declared righteous. The student effectively highlights key aspects of justification, such as imputation, reconciliation, and sanctification, while also clarifying the distinction between justification and sanctification. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic with doctrinal correctness being paramount. Great job!"
