## [Answer](../God_s_Justification.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a crucial question!

In Christian theology, justification refers to the process by which God declares sinners righteous, not because of any good works or efforts on their part, but solely through faith in Jesus Christ. This concept is central to Christian doctrine and is rooted in Scripture.

The Bible teaches that all humans are born sinful (Romans 3:23) and separated from a holy God (Isaiah 59:2). As a result, we're under the wrath of God (John 3:36) and deserving of eternal punishment. However, God's love and mercy desire to reconcile us to Himself.

Justification occurs when an individual places their faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord (Acts 16:31). This faith is not just intellectual assent but a trust that involves surrendering one's life to Jesus' authority and will. Through this faith, the sinner is:

1. Declared righteous: God pronounces the believer "not guilty" and credits them with Christ's righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21).
2. Imputed sin: The believer's sins are imputed (credited) to Jesus, who bore their punishment on the cross (Romans 5:8-9).
3. Reconciled: God is no longer angry or opposed to the believer; instead, He becomes a loving Father (Matthew 6:32).
4. Given eternal life: The believer receives new life in Christ, which begins at conversion and continues into eternity (John 3:36).

Justification entails several key aspects:

1. Forensic justification: God renders a legal verdict of "not guilty" to the believer's account, declaring them righteous.
2. Imputation: The believer's sins are imputed to Jesus, while Christ's righteousness is imputed to the believer.
3. Reckoning: The believer is reckoned as having died and risen with Christ (Romans 6:4-5), which results in their old life being put to death and a new one being raised.
4. Sanctification: While justification is a one-time event, sanctification – the process of becoming more like Christ – is an ongoing work that follows justification.

In summary, justification is the means by which God declares sinners righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. It's a judicial act where God imputes sin to Jesus and credits righteousness to the believer, resulting in reconciliation, eternal life, and new life in Christ.
