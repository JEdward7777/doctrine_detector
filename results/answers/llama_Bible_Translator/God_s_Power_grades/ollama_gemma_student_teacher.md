## [Answer](../God_s_Power.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Almighty" (Hebrew: שדי, romanized: Shaddai; Greek: παντοκράτωρ, romanized: pantokrator) is a title ascribed to God in the Bible that conveys His absolute power and authority. When we say that God is Almighty, we're affirming that He has unlimited and unqualified power over all things.

In Hebrew, the term Shaddai is often used in conjunction with El Olam (the Everlasting God) to describe God's eternal nature and omnipotence (Genesis 17:1; 28:3). The phrase "Almighty God" or "God Almighty" (as it appears in some English translations of Psalm 83:18) underscores God's unmatched ability to do as He pleases, unhindered by any external constraints.

The concept of almightiness is closely tied to other attributes of God that are revealed throughout Scripture. For example:

1. Sovereignty: As the Almighty, God exercises absolute control over all creation (Psalm 135:6; Isaiah 46:9-10).
2. Omnipotence: His power is limitless and unbound by any external forces or limitations (Job 42:2; Revelation 19:6).
3. Faithfulness: Despite His almightiness, God remains faithful to His promises and covenant with humanity (Psalm 91:1; Isaiah 54:10).

In Christian theology, the concept of God's almightiness is often seen as a reflection of His sovereignty over all things, including human history and our individual lives. This understanding serves as a foundation for our trust in God's goodness, wisdom, and providence.

As the Bible declares, "The Lord has made everything for his purpose; even the wicked are kept for the evil day” (Proverbs 16:4). In this sense, God's almightiness is not only a demonstration of His power but also an affirmation of His wisdom and justice in allowing or preventing certain events to unfold.

In conclusion, when we acknowledge God as Almighty, we're acknowledging His absolute power and authority over all things. This understanding underscores the trustworthiness of God's character, His sovereignty over human history, and our dependence on Him for everything.
