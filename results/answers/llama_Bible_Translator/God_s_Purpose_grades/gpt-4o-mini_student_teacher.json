  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that incorporates key Christian principles and practices for discerning God's plan. They effectively integrated relevant Biblical references and emphasized the importance of prayer, scripture, wisdom from others, and openness to God's leading. The only suggestion for improvement would be to simplify the language in some parts to enhance clarity and conciseness. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of how believers can discern God's plan amidst spiritual uncertainty."
