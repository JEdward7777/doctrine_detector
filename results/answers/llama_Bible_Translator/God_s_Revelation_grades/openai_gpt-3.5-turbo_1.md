# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a wonderful question!

In the Bible, God introduces Himself using various names and titles that reveal His character, nature, and attributes. One of the most significant names is Yahweh (YHWH), which is considered the sacred name of God. The name Yahweh appears over 6,800 times in the Old Testament.

The name Yahweh is first introduced in Exodus 3:14-15:

"God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.' He said this as a response to Moses' question about who he should say sent him. God also said to Moses, 'Say this to those people: "I AM has sent me to you."'" (NIV)

This name Yahweh is significant because it signifies God's eternal nature and self-existent being. In other words, God is the One who always was and will be; He is the self-sufficient, all-powerful, and all-knowing Creator.

In addition to Yahweh, the Bible also uses other names and titles that reveal God's character:

1. Jehovah (Yahweh) - often used in poetry and prophetic writings.
2. Elohim (God) - a more general term for God as creator.
3. Adonai (Lord) - emphasizing God's sovereignty and authority.
4. El Shaddai (God Almighty) - highlighting God's power and strength.
5. Abba Father (Galatians 4:6) - a title that emphasizes God's paternal love and care.

These names and titles help us understand the nature of God, His relationship with humanity, and His purpose for our lives. As we read and study these names in Scripture, we can gain a deeper understanding of who God is and how He desires to interact with us as His children.
