## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a wonderful topic! The concept of being "born again" is a pivotal aspect of the Christian faith, and it's crucial to understand God's role in this process.

In John 3:3-8, Jesus teaches Nicodemus that becoming a follower of Christ requires a spiritual rebirth. This experience is often referred to as being born again or regenerated. In this context, God plays a primary role in the process.

Here's what Scripture reveals about God's involvement:

1. **Initiation**: God initiates the process of regeneration. It's not something we can earn or achieve on our own; rather, it's a sovereign work of God's Spirit (John 6:44, Ephesians 2:4-5).
2. **Conviction**: Before regenerating us, God often convicts us of our sin and need for salvation through the Holy Spirit (John 16:8). This conviction is meant to lead us to repentance and faith in Christ.
3. **Regeneration**: When we respond to God's convicting work with faith and repentance, He regenerates us – giving us new spiritual life (John 3:5-7, Ephesians 2:1-3). This is a miraculous transformation that occurs when the Holy Spirit takes up residence within us.
4. **Enabling**: Throughout the process, God enables us to respond to His call by giving us faith and the desire to follow Him (Philippians 1:6, 2 Peter 1:1).
5. **Sanctification**: As we are born again, God begins a lifelong process of sanctifying us – making us more like Christ as we learn to obey His commands (2 Corinthians 7:1, 1 Thessalonians 4:3-8).

In summary, God is the primary actor in the process of being born again. He initiates the process through conviction and regeneration, enabling us to respond with faith and repentance. As we are transformed by this new life in Christ, God continues to work in us, sanctifying us and guiding us toward a deeper relationship with Him.

Remember, our salvation is not just about what we do; it's primarily about what God has done for us through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9).
