  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and doctrinally sound explanation of God's role in the process of a person being born again. The student effectively uses relevant Scripture passages to support their points and articulates the sovereignty of God in initiation, conviction, regeneration, enabling, and sanctification in a clear and coherent manner. The emphasis on the work of God through the Holy Spirit aligns well with the Christian worldview. The only room for improvement would be a deeper exploration of how God's grace and election play a role in this process, but overall, this is an excellent answer."
