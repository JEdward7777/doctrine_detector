  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 95.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response that aligns closely with the Christian worldview concerning God's role in the process of a person being born again. The student accurately referenced key Bible verses and theological concepts to support their explanations. The student also emphasized the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation, as indicated in the concern.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could have been slightly improved by directly stating that new birth is solely a work of God's initiative, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. This emphasis would have further reinforced the understanding of God's sovereignty in the process of being born again."
