  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of God's punishment during the 'day of Yahweh' in the Hebrew Scriptures. They accurately highlighted the catastrophic nature of God's judgment and the consequences for disbelief, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses strengthens their response. However, the student could have directly connected the concept of God's wrath being poured out upon those who do not believe with the teacher's reference answer to fully address the concern provided."
