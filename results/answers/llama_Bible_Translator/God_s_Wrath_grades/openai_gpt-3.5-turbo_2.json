It effectively recognizes the nature of God's judgment as a pouring out of His wrath upon those who reject Him, aligning with a Christian worldview perspective on the consequences for disbelief. The response could be further enhanced by emphasizing the importance of repentance and turning towards God to avoid the impending judgment."
