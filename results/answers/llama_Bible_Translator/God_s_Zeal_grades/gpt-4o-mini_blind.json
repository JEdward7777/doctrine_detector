  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-explained answer that effectively conveys the concept of \"the zeal of the Lord\" in various Biblical contexts. The connections made between God's zeal, justice, righteousness, and love for His people are sound and align with Christian teachings. However, to improve the grade, the student could further strengthen the response by incorporating more direct Scriptural references to support their points and by emphasizing the primacy of God's glory in His zeal for His people. Overall, a solid effort with room for minor enhancements."
