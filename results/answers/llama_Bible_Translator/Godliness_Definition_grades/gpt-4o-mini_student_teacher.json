  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer by exploring various aspects of godliness as defined in different Bible passages. However, there is room for improvement in directly incorporating the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes acting in a way that pleases God, obeying Him, and living in a righteous manner. The student's response could be enhanced by aligning more closely with the reference answer while still drawing on the additional supporting Biblical passages."
