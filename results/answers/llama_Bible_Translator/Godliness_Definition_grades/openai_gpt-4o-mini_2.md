## [Answer](../Godliness_Definition.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

The Bible defines "godliness" as a way of life that is characterized by a deepening relationship with God and a conformity to His character. In other words, godliness is about becoming more like Jesus Christ, who is the very embodiment of God's character.

In 1 Timothy 2:8-10, Paul writes, "I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or arguing. I also want women to adorn themselves modestly and respectively apparel, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly raiment, but with good works, as befits women who profess reverence for God." Here, Paul says that godliness is about living a life of reverence for God, characterized by humility, simplicity, and a focus on spiritual things.

In Titus 2:11-12, Paul gives us a further definition of godliness when he writes, "For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to reject godless ways and its empty boasts, which from the ignorant arrogance of an unwise heart." Here, godliness is about rejecting the worldly values and behaviors that are contrary to God's will and instead seeking a life that is characterized by humility, gratitude, and obedience to God.

In 2 Peter 3:11, we read, "Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives while you await certain hope and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ." Here, Peter says that godliness is about living a life that is characterized by holiness – set apart for God's purposes.

So, to summarize, the Bible defines "godliness" as a way of life that is characterized by:

1. A deepening relationship with God
2. Conformity to God's character
3. Humility and simplicity
4. A focus on spiritual things
5. Rejection of worldly values and behaviors
6. Obedience to God's will
7. Holiness – set apart for God's purposes

May we all strive to live a life that is characterized by these godly qualities!
