  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of how Jesus approached the healing of demon-possessed individuals, drawing on key biblical references and principles. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' authority over evil spirits, the importance of prayer and faith in healing, and the broader spiritual context of demonic possession and deliverance. The application of a Christian worldview is robust and reflects a deep understanding of Christian beliefs and values. Great job overall."
