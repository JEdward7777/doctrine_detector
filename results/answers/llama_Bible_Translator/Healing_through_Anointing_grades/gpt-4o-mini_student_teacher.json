  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the practice of anointing in the New Testament and how it is related to healing, citing specific examples and connecting them to God's power and presence. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern provided, which is recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice. The student's answer touched on these aspects but could have been more explicit in tying the practice of anointing to seeking healing and God's intervention."
