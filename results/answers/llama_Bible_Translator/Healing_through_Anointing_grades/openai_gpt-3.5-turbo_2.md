## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The practice of anointing in the New Testament is closely tied to healing, as it is often associated with God's power and presence. In the Gospels, we see several instances where Jesus uses anointing oil to heal people.

One significant example is when a woman with a flow of blood touches Jesus' garment, which has been anointed with oil (Mark 5:25-34, Luke 8:42-48). This act of faith leads to her immediate healing. Jesus then says that the power had left Him because of her faith, implying that the anointing oil was a means by which she accessed God's power.

In another instance, Mary Magdalene anoints Jesus' feet with costly perfume and wipes them with her hair (John 12:1-8). This act is seen as a preparation for His burial, but it also foreshadows the way in which Jesus would be crucified and then resurrected. In this context, the anointing oil may symbolize God's anointing of Jesus for His mission.

In addition to these specific instances, the concept of anointing is closely related to healing throughout the New Testament. In Hebrews 1:9, we read that the Lord anointed Jesus with the Holy Spirit and "the power of eternal salvation." This act of anointing gave Jesus the authority to heal and save humanity.

In a broader sense, the anointing oil used in biblical times was seen as a symbol of God's presence and power. When applied to someone or something, it signified God's blessing and protection. In this light, when we read about anointing in the New Testament, we see it as a means by which people accessed God's healing power.

Today, the practice of anointing is often used in Christian worship services, particularly during times of prayer for healing or comfort. While it may not be possible to apply actual anointing oil, many Christians believe that the symbolic act of anointing with oil or other substances can serve as a powerful reminder of God's presence and power.

Ultimately, the practice of anointing in the New Testament is closely tied to healing because it represents God's power and presence. When we pray for healing or comfort, we are not simply asking for physical restoration; we are seeking to experience God's power and presence in our lives.
