  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of who was allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant and under what circumstances according to Scripture. The references to Exodus, Leviticus, and the significance of the Day of Atonement are well-supported. The mention of exceptional events involving other individuals like Moses or Samuel approaching the Ark adds depth to the answer. Overall, a strong and doctrinally correct explanation. Great job!"
