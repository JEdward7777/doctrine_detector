They demonstrated a good understanding of the scriptural references and the significance of the Day of Atonement in this context. However, they included additional information about prophets approaching the Ark under exceptional circumstances, which, while true, slightly deviates from the specific concern about the high priest's unique role. Overall, the answer effectively addresses the concern and provides a comprehensive explanation."
