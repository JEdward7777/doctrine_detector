## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Scripture, only certain individuals were allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant, and even then, it was under very specific circumstances.

In Exodus 26:33-34 and 40:20-21, we read that the Ark was placed in the Most Holy Place (also known as the Holy of Holies) within the Tabernacle. Only the High Priest, once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), could enter the Most Holy Place and approach the Ark.

This is because the High Priest had to offer a sacrifice for sin on behalf of himself and all the people of Israel (Leviticus 16:11-12). The blood of the sacrifice was applied to the Mercy Seat, which was the cover of the Ark (Exodus 25:17-18; Leviticus 16:14).

As the High Priest entered the Most Holy Place, he would sprinkle the blood on the Mercy Seat, signifying the atonement for sin. Only after this act could he approach the Ark and offer a prayer to God (Leviticus 16:12-13). This sacred ritual was a unique and solemn moment in Israel's worship.

It's worth noting that other individuals, such as prophets like Moses or Samuel, were also able to approach the Ark under extraordinary circumstances, but these instances are recorded as exceptional events rather than a regular practice.

In summary, only the High Priest was allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant, and even then, it was limited to once a year on the Day of Atonement when he would offer a sacrifice for sin.
