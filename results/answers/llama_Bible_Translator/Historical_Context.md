## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the prophetic books of Isaiah and Amos, the concept of "remnant" refers to a small group of God's people who remain faithful to Him amidst widespread apostasy. The remnant is often contrasted with the majority who turn away from God.

Some key biblical events that illustrate this concept include:

1. Israel's exodus from Egypt: In Isaiah 10:22-23, it is written, "A remnant will return." This verse alludes to the small group of Israelites who escaped slavery in Egypt and went on to inherit the Promised Land. Despite the majority of Israelites being trapped in slavery, God spared a remnant that remained faithful to Him.
2. The Assyrian invasion: Isaiah 1:8-9 describes how the majority of Judah's people turned away from God during the Assyrian invasion, but a remnant was preserved. This event is echoed in Amos 7:1-3, where God says He will spare a few people out of Israel and Judah.
3. The Babylonian exile: In Isaiah 6:9-13, God promises to preserve a remnant during the Babylonian exile. While many Jews were taken captive or assimilated into Babylonian culture, a small group remained faithful to God and returned to Jerusalem after the exile.
4. The post-exilic community: After the exile, a remnant of Israelites returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt the Temple (Haggai 1:12-15; Zechariah 8:19-23). This remnant was seen as a new beginning for God's people, with a focus on faithfulness rather than physical restoration.
5. The coming of Jesus Christ: In Matthew 24:13-14, Jesus says that those who endure to the end will be saved, implying that not all believers will survive persecution or tribulation. This event illustrates the concept of a remnant, where God preserves a small group of faithful people amidst greater apostasy.

These biblical events demonstrate that throughout Israel's history, God has preserved a remnant of faithful people, even when the majority has turned away from Him. This concept is also applicable to the Church today, as believers continue to face challenges and temptations, but remain committed to their faith in Jesus Christ.
