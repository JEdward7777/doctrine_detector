  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of recognizing the historical event that shapes the practice of eating unleavened bread during Passover, specifically highlighting God's instruction for the Israelites to flee quickly without waiting for their bread to rise. The explanation is concise and accurate, referencing relevant biblical passages (Exodus 12:17-20, Deuteronomy 16:3, Exodus 12:39).\n\nThe response also acknowledges Jesus' connection to this event during the Last Supper, which shows an understanding of how historical events shape religious practices. However, the response could have gone further in exploring the significance of unleavened bread as a symbol of Israel's redemption from slavery and its connection to Christ's sacrifice on the cross.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the historical event that shapes the practice of eating unleavened bread during Passover, but could be more developed in terms of exploring the deeper theological connections."
