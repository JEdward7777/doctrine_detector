## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Exodus 12:17-20 and Deuteronomy 16:3, the Israelites ate unleavened bread (matzah) during their escape from Egypt because God commanded them to do so as a part of the Passover celebration.

In preparation for their departure, God instructed Moses to tell the Israelites to mark their doorposts with blood, and then they were to eat the Passover meal, which included matzah and roasted lamb. The unleavened bread was a symbol of their hasty departure from Egypt, where there wasn't time for the dough to rise (Exodus 12:39).

This event has become known as the "First Fruits" of Israel's redemption from slavery in Egypt. Jesus later referred to this event when He instituted the Lord's Supper at the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26-30, Mark 14:22-25), using unleavened bread and saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19).

In summary, the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a part of God's instructions for the Passover celebration, symbolizing their hasty departure and looking forward to Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response does a good job of recognizing the historical event that shapes the practice of eating unleavened bread during Passover, specifically highlighting God's instruction for the Israelites to flee quickly without waiting for their bread to rise. The explanation is concise and accurate, referencing relevant biblical passages (Exodus 12:17-20, Deuteronomy 16:3, Exodus 12:39).

The response also acknowledges Jesus' connection to this event during the Last Supper, which shows an understanding of how historical events shape religious practices. However, the response could have gone further in exploring the significance of unleavened bread as a symbol of Israel's redemption from slavery and its connection to Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the historical event that shapes the practice of eating unleavened bread during Passover, but could be more developed in terms of exploring the deeper theological connections.
