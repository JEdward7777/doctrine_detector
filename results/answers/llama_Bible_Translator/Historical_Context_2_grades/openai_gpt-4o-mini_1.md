## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Exodus 12:17-20 and Deuteronomy 16:3, the Israelites ate unleavened bread (matzah) during their escape from Egypt because God commanded them to do so as a part of the Passover celebration.

In preparation for their departure, God instructed Moses to tell the Israelites to mark their doorposts with blood, and then they were to eat the Passover meal, which included matzah and roasted lamb. The unleavened bread was a symbol of their hasty departure from Egypt, where there wasn't time for the dough to rise (Exodus 12:39).

This event has become known as the "First Fruits" of Israel's redemption from slavery in Egypt. Jesus later referred to this event when He instituted the Lord's Supper at the Last Supper (Matthew 26:26-30, Mark 14:22-25), using unleavened bread and saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19).

In summary, the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt as a part of God's instructions for the Passover celebration, symbolizing their hasty departure and looking forward to Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.

Comment: This response demonstrates a deep understanding of the historical context and religious significance of the Israelites eating unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt. The student effectively connects the Old Testament events to Jesus' institution of the Lord's Supper, highlighting the parallelism between the Passover tradition and Christian beliefs. The only potential area for improvement could be further elaboration on the significance of the "First Fruits" aspect of Israel's redemption.
