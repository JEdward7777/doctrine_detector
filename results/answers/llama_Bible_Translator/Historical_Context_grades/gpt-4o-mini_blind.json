  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the concept of \"remnant\" as seen in Isaiah and Amos, supported by relevant biblical events. The student effectively connects the concept to historical events in Israel's history and relates it to the present-day Church. The response could be further strengthened by including more direct references to specific verses in Isaiah and Amos that explicitly mention the remnant concept. Overall, well done."
