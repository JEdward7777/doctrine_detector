  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of the concept of \"remnant\" in the context of Isaiah and Amos, connecting it to key biblical events. The student effectively demonstrates how the remnant is a small faithful group preserved by God amidst apostasy. However, the response could benefit from focusing more on the specific biblical events mentioned in the teacher's reference answer, aligning closer with the historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises. The student's answer, while detailed, could further highlight the themes of God's covenant and persistence throughout the chosen events."
