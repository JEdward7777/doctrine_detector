  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a strong and thorough analysis of how the Roman practice of crucifixion impacted the perception of the cross in early Christianity. The student effectively highlights the association with suffering, sacrifice, and redemption, as well as the unique significance of Christ's death on the cross. The explanation is clear and supported by relevant theological insights. However, there are minor areas where a deeper exploration of scriptural references or theological nuances could further enhance the response."
