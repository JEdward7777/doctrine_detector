It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating the transformation of the cross from a symbol of shame and suffering to one of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection. The incorporation of Christian theology and evangelistic significance shows a deep understanding of the Christian worldview and the significance of the cross within it. However, a more direct connection to the answer provided in terms of transformation could further strengthen the response."
