It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how the symbol of shame and suffering was transformed into one of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection, central to the Christian message. The connection between the Roman crucifixion practice and the Christian understanding of redemption, sacrifice, and evangelism is well articulated, demonstrating a strong Christian worldview perspective."
