  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of individuals from the Bible who built altars and the significance of those acts. The examples are well-detailed and supported with relevant biblical references. The student effectively explains the significance of each individual's altar-building in relation to worship, obedience, and commitment to God. The answer could be enhanced by further emphasizing the theological significance of altars as places of sacrifice and encounter with God, as well as linking the concept of altars to the atonement and sacrificial system in the Old Testament. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a good understanding of the topic."
