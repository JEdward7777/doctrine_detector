## [Answer](../Historical_Examples.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, building an altar is a significant act that symbolizes worship, obedience, and commitment to God. Here are some examples:

1. Abraham (Genesis 12:7-8, 13:18; 15:2-21; 22:1-14): Abraham builds several altars throughout his life, including one at Shechem ( Genesis 12:7-8) and another in the land of Moriah (Genesis 22:1-14). These altars represent Abraham's willingness to surrender his own desires and plans to God's will.

Significance: Abraham's altars demonstrate his faith and trust in God, as he commits to follow God's commandments and obey His instructions.

2. Jacob (Genesis 28:17-18; 33:20): Jacob builds an altar at Bethel after a dream in which he sees angels ascending and descending from heaven (Genesis 28:12-19). Later, he rebuilds the altar at Shechem, renaming it El-Bethel ("God of the House").

Significance: Jacob's altars represent his recognition of God's presence and sovereignty over all creation. By building an altar, Jacob is acknowledging God's goodness and provision in his life.

3. Moses (Exodus 17:1-7; Deuteronomy 27:4-8): During the Israelites' wilderness journey, Moses builds an altar after God delivers them from Pharaoh's army at the Red Sea. Later, Moses builds altars on Mount Ebal and Gerizim as part of the covenant ceremony (Deuteronomy 27:1-10).

Significance: Moses' altars symbolize God's deliverance and provision for His people. By building an altar, Moses is acknowledging God's faithfulness and commitment to Israel.

4. Gideon (Judges 6:11-24): After receiving a divine commission from the Angel of the Lord, Gideon builds an altar at Ophrah, naming it "The Lord Is Peace" (Judges 6:24).

Significance: Gideon's altar represents his faith and trust in God's sovereignty. By building an altar, Gideon is acknowledging God's power and provision in his life.

5. Joshua (Joshua 4:1-8): After the Israelites cross the Jordan River into the Promised Land, Joshua builds altars at Gilgal, naming them "Witnesses" (Joshua 4:20).

Significance: Joshua's altars symbolize the people's dedication to following God and their commitment to entering the land He promised. By building an altar, Joshua is acknowledging God's sovereignty over the land.

In each of these examples, building an altar represents a significant moment of worship, obedience, and commitment to God. The act of building an altar serves as a reminder of one's dependence on God and His faithfulness in their lives.
