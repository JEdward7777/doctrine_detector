  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer with practical suggestions on introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit to those unfamiliar with the Trinity. However, the answer lacks direct reference to the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity, as emphasized in the reference answer. While the student included valuable insights on the Holy Spirit's role and characteristics, emphasizing the foundational understanding of the Holy Spirit as part of the Triune God could have strengthened the answer from a Christian-specific worldview."
