  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of having no hope according to biblical references and how it reflects a state of spiritual darkness and separation from God. They referenced relevant Bible verses to support their points. However, the student could have tied their explanation back more directly to the concern provided and the reference answer from the teacher, which emphasized the importance of having no expectation of good and going against God's promises."
