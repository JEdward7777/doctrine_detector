What a great question!

The term "hosts" is used primarily in the Old Testament, particularly in the book of Psalms (e.g., Psalm 68:14; 80:7; 83:1-4). In this context, "hosts" refers to God's heavenly army or heavenly host. This term encompasses various types of spiritual beings that serve and worship God in heaven.

In biblical language, the phrase "hosts of heaven" (Hebrew: צְבָאי הַשָּׁמַי) is a figurative expression used to describe the multitude of angels, cherubim, seraphim, and other heavenly beings that are part of God's divine retinue. These hosts are often depicted as mighty warriors, carrying out God's will and maintaining the order of creation.

In Psalm 68:14, for example, we read: "When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" (ESV). Here, the "sons of God" likely refer to these heavenly hosts, rejoicing at some significant event in God's plan.

Similarly, Psalm 80:7 says: "For they got not the land in possession by their own sword—nor did their arm save them—but Thy right hand and Thine arm, and the light of the Hosts." (KJV). In this context, the "Hosts" are God's angelic army, which worked alongside Him to deliver Israel from oppression.

In Psalm 83:1-4, we find a description of these hosts as they prepare for battle:

"Do not keep silence, O God! Do not hold Your peace, nor be still, O God!
For behold, Your enemies make a tumult; And those who hate You have lifted up their head.
They have taken counsel against You; And the sons of God will have a meeting;
They will turn at noon to take advantage of the Hosts." (ESV)

Here, the "sons of God" are again likely referring to these heavenly hosts, who are poised to engage in battle on behalf of God.

In summary, when the Bible uses the term "hosts," it typically refers to God's heavenly army or spiritual beings that serve and worship Him in heaven. These hosts are often depicted as mighty warriors, carrying out God's will and maintaining the order of creation.
