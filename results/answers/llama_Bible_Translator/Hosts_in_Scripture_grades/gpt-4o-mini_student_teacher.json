  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as an 85.\n\nThe student demonstrates a strong understanding of the term \"hosts\" in Scripture, specifically focusing on the Old Testament references in Psalms and providing detailed explanations with relevant verses. The student accurately identifies the hosts as God's heavenly army or heavenly beings, showcasing a solid grasp of the topic. However, there is room for improvement in connecting the concept of hosts with the concern of spiritual warfare and divine authority. The student could have delved deeper into how understanding the hosts impacts a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles, which would have strengthened their response."
