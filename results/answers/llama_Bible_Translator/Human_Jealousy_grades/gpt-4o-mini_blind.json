The student effectively addresses the issue of jealousy within relationships from a Christian worldview. They provide practical and scripturally sound advice on how to respond to feelings of jealousy with humility, trust in God, communication, and repentance. The emphasis on seeking God's help, cultivating gratitude, and accountability is commendable. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally accurate response."
