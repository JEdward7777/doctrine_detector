  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer on how to respond to feelings of jealousy in relationships from a Christian perspective. They incorporate relevant biblical principles and offer practical steps for addressing jealousy. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on the concern of reflecting on personal relationships and the impact of jealousy on them, rather than solely providing general advice on dealing with jealousy. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of how jealousy can affect relationships and offers sound advice grounded in Christian principles."
