  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a strong explanation of how a person can be declared righteous according to the Christian faith through faith in Jesus Christ and His atonement. The biblical references are appropriately used to support the explanation. The concept of justification by faith is well articulated. The answer could be further enhanced by including the role of repentance in the process of being declared righteous before God."
