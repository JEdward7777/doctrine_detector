  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate explanation of how a person can be declared righteous according to the Christian faith through faith in Jesus Christ and His substitutionary atonement. They have incorporated relevant scripture references and explained the concept of justification by faith well. The answer aligns closely with the reference answer given by the teacher, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. However, the student could improve by providing more direct quotes or references to support their points and by ensuring a tighter alignment with the concise wording of the reference answer."
