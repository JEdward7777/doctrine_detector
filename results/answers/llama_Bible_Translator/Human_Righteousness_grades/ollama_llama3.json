  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response accurately and thoroughly explains the concept of justification by faith in Jesus Christ, citing relevant Scripture and providing a clear explanation of how it works. The writer correctly emphasizes that our righteousness before God is not based on anything good we've done, but rather on what Christ has done for us. The response also touches on the importance of acknowledging our sinfulness and trusting in Jesus to save us.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is in providing a more detailed explanation of why justification by faith is essential for understanding salvation. While the writer does mention that \"clarifying the basis for human righteousness\" is important, they could have elaborated further on how this concept is crucial for grasping the nature of salvation and our relationship with God.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a strong and clear explanation of justification by faith in Jesus Christ, making it a high-quality answer."
