## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Christian faith, a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ and His substitutionary atonement on the cross.

In Romans 3:21-26, Paul writes that all humans have sinned and fallen short of God's glory. However, this problem is solved when we put our faith in Jesus Christ, who was given as a gift to declare the righteousness of God (Romans 3:25-26). This is often referred to as "justification by faith."

Justification refers to the declaration that a person is righteous before God, despite their actual sinfulness. It's not that we're saying our sins don't exist or aren't serious. Rather, it's that God sees us as righteous because of what Jesus has done for us.

Here's how it works:

1. We recognize our sinfulness and acknowledge our need for a Savior.
2. We put our faith in Jesus Christ, trusting that He is the one who can save us from our sins.
3. Through His death on the cross, Jesus paid the price for our sins, taking the punishment we deserve.
4. When we believe in Him, God declares us righteous, not because of anything good we've done, but because of what Christ has done.

This is why Paul writes, "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him" (John 3:17). Jesus didn't come to punish us for our sins; He came to forgive and justify us by His blood.

In other words, when we trust in Jesus Christ, we're not trying to earn righteousness or prove ourselves worthy. Rather, we're acknowledging that we can never be good enough on our own and trusting that God has provided a way for us to be declared righteous through faith in Him.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

This response accurately and thoroughly explains the concept of justification by faith in Jesus Christ, citing relevant Scripture and providing a clear explanation of how it works. The writer correctly emphasizes that our righteousness before God is not based on anything good we've done, but rather on what Christ has done for us. The response also touches on the importance of acknowledging our sinfulness and trusting in Jesus to save us.

The only area where this response could improve is in providing a more detailed explanation of why justification by faith is essential for understanding salvation. While the writer does mention that "clarifying the basis for human righteousness" is important, they could have elaborated further on how this concept is crucial for grasping the nature of salvation and our relationship with God.

Overall, however, this response provides a strong and clear explanation of justification by faith in Jesus Christ, making it a high-quality answer.
