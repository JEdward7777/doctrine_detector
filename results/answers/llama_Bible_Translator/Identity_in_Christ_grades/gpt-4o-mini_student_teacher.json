  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 90.\n\nThe student provides a thorough and insightful explanation of what it means when God says, \"I have called you by name.\" They effectively tie in relevant biblical references and theological concepts to support their interpretation, demonstrating a strong understanding of the topic. The response also addresses the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ by highlighting the personal relationship and chosen status believers have with God. The addition of the concept of adoption in Christ further enriches the explanation.\n\nThe only minor point of improvement would be to include more direct reference to the personal and relational aspect of God calling individuals by name, which is the central theme of the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student's response shows depth of understanding and clarity in connecting the biblical concept to the concern provided."
