## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
When God says "I have called you by name" (e.g., Isaiah 45:4; Romans 8:30), He is making a profound declaration about His personal relationship with each individual believer. In this context, the phrase "called by name" carries significant implications.

In ancient times, when someone was "called by name," it meant that they had been given a specific identity or purpose. This terminology was often used in business and commerce, where merchants would call out the names of available goods or services to potential customers. When God says He has called us by name, He is asserting His intimate knowledge of each person and their unique destiny.

In this sense, being "called by name" implies that:

1. **God knows you intimately**: He is familiar with your individual circumstances, strengths, weaknesses, and purposes.
2. **You have a special purpose**: God has a specific plan or mission for your life, which is connected to His overall redemptive plan.
3. **You are chosen**: When God calls someone by name, it's an expression of His sovereignty and selection. He has chosen you for a particular task or role.

This phrase also alludes to the concept of adoption in Christ (Galatians 4:5-7; Ephesians 1:5). Just as a parent gives their child a unique identity, so too does God give each believer a new identity in Christ. This new identity is rooted in their relationship with Him and is characterized by faithfulness to His call.

In summary, when God says "I have called you by name," He is emphasizing His personal connection with us, affirming our individual purpose, and reminding us of our adoption into His family.
