The student correctly connects the name to its Hebrew and Greek origins, and effectively explains how the name reflects Jesus' mission of salvation, lordship, humanity's need for a Savior, and God's redemptive plan. The answer is well-supported with relevant scripture references and aligns well with Christian teachings on the identity and purpose of Jesus. Great job!"
