  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Jesus's name and its connection to His role as Savior. The answer references biblical passages and provides a detailed analysis of the implications of the name \"Jesus.\" However, the student's answer could be improved by directly stating that the name 'Jesus' means 'Yahweh saves,' as indicated in the reference answer. This direct connection would strengthen the clarity and conciseness of the response, aligning it more closely with a Christian worldview."
