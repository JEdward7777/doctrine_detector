## [Answer](../Identity_of_Jesus.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The name "Jesus" is of great significance in understanding His purpose and identity.

In Hebrew, Jesus' name is Yeshua (ישוע), which is a shortened form of Joshua (Yehoshua). In Greek, the New Testament language, it's rendered as Iesous (Ιησους). The name "Jesus" is derived from this Greek rendering.

The name "Jesus" carries significance because it means "the Lord saves" or "the Savior" (Matthew 1:21; Luke 1:31-33). This name underscores Jesus' mission and purpose: to save humanity from sin and its consequences. In other words, Jesus came to earth as the Messiah, the Anointed One, to rescue people from their sinful state and reconcile them to God.

This naming highlights several important aspects of Jesus' ministry:

1. Salvation: Jesus is the one who brings salvation to those who put their faith in Him (John 3:16).
2. Lordship: The name "Jesus" emphasizes His divine authority and lordship over all creation (Philippians 2:9-11).
3. Humanity's need for a Savior: The name "Jesus" reminds us that humanity is in dire need of salvation, and Jesus is the One who provides it.
4. God's redemptive plan: The name "Jesus" signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to send a Messiah to rescue His people (Isaiah 53; Luke 2:11).

In summary, the name "Jesus" is a declaration of His purpose: to save humanity from sin and its consequences, demonstrating God's love and redemption for all people.
