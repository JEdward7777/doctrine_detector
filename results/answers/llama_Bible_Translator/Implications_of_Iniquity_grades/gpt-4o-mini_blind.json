The student demonstrates a solid grasp of the deeper biblical concept of iniquity and its implications for Christian conduct. The answer effectively connects theological principles with practical applications, emphasizing compassion, love, humility, and redemption. The response could have been strengthened by citing specific Bible verses to support the points made and by incorporating a clearer distinction between the roles of justice and mercy in responding to iniquity. Overall, a well-developed and doctrinally sound response."
