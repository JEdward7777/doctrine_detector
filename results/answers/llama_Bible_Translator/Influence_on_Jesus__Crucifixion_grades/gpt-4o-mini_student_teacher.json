  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed explanation of the roles and characteristics of the Sadducees and Pharisees in the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion, the answer lacks a clear connection to the reference answer's focus on selfishness and hypocrisy as the driving factors behind their influence on crucifying Jesus. The student's answer delves into the theological and historical aspects of the Pharisees and Sadducees without emphasizing their selfish motives and hypocrisy as highlighted in the reference answer.\n\nTo improve the grade, the student should focus more on analyzing how the selfishness and hypocrisy of the religious leaders influenced their decisions regarding Jesus' crucifixion, and how this aligns with Jesus' teachings and condemnation of their actions."
