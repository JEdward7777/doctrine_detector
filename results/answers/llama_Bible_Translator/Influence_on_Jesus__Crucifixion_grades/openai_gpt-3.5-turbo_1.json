It effectively connects the biblical narrative to the broader theme of conflict between Jesus and religious leaders, highlighting the consequences of selfishness, hypocrisy, pride, and lack of spiritual insight. The response could benefit from more explicit references to the relevance of this conflict for contemporary faith and how Christians today can learn from these historical events."
