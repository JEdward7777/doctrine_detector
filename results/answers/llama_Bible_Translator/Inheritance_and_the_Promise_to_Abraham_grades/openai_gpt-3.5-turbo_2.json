The link to Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of this covenant is insightful and aligns well with the Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is for not directly addressing the concern of how this covenant impacts believers today, rather focusing more on the historical context. Overall, a strong and comprehensive understanding is demonstrated."
