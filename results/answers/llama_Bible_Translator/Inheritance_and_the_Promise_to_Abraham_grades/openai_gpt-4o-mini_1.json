The incorporation of specific verses from Genesis and the connection to the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ shows a deep insight into the Christian worldview. The response could have further expanded on how this covenant impacts believers today in terms of spiritual inheritance and promises, but overall it addresses the concern effectively."
