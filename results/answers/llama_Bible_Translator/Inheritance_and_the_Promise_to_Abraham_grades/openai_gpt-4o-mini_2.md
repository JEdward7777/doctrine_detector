According to Genesis 12:1-3, God made a covenant with Abram (later renamed Abraham), promising him and his descendants the land of Canaan. The specific promise is found in verse 7:

"And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, out of the land of the Chaldees, that bid thee, Go into my land, in a hurry. And thou shalt know for certain that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs; and they shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years. And also that nation, which they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they depart with great substance."

In this promise, God declared that Abram's descendants would inherit the land of Canaan. This promise was later reaffirmed to Abraham in Genesis 15:18-21:

"In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram; saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the flood of Euphrates; The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, The Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaim, And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."

This promise of land inheritance is a crucial aspect of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. It serves as a foreshadowing of the ultimate redemption of creation, which would come through the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who would inherit all nations (Psalm 72:8-11; Revelation 11:15).
