## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I can confidently say that according to Scripture, the gift of eternal life is offered to all people through faith in Jesus Christ. Here's how it works:

* Romans 3:23 says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." This verse highlights the reality that we're all sinful by nature.
* Romans 6:23 states, "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." Here, Paul makes it clear that our sin earns us spiritual death, not life.
* But then comes the good news! Ephesians 2:8-9 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not from yourselves, it is a gift of Godâ€”not by works, so that no one can boast." Here, we see that salvation (eternal life) is a free gift given to us through faith in Jesus Christ.
* John 3:16 puts it simply: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

So, what must one do to inherit eternal life? According to the Bible, we must:

1. Recognize our sinful state (Romans 3:23).
2. Place faith in Jesus Christ as the solution for our sin problem (Ephesians 2:8-9; John 3:16).
3. Receive the gift of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.

Remember, eternal life is not something we can earn or work for; it's a free gift given to us through faith in Jesus Christ!
