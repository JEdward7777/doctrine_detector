  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus in the Bible. They correctly cited relevant verses and highlighted the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for receiving the gift of eternal life. The only slight deduction is for not directly referencing the specific interaction with the expert in Jewish law as exemplified by the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a strong and well-supported response from a Christian worldview perspective."
