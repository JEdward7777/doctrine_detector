  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The response provided lacks important details and teachings about the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. It does not adequately address the specific concerns given, offering a vague and incomplete explanation compared to the detailed and scripturally supported response provided by the Christian Bible translator. Further elaboration and alignment with biblical teachings are needed to receive a higher grade."
