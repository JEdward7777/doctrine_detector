  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively expands on the examples of injustice provided in the initial answer, outlining specific forms of injustice such as racial inequalities, economic exploitation, gender-based violence, refugee crises, and environmental degradation. The response then offers practical ways for Christians to engage in activism against injustice, aligning with biblical principles of compassion, justice, and faithfulness. The incorporation of relevant Bible verses and the emphasis on prayer, education, advocacy, service, modeling just practices, support for marginalized communities, and engaging in respectful dialogue showcase a comprehensive and Christ-centered approach to addressing injustice."
