It addresses the concern effectively by demonstrating how obedience, prayer, heart posture, choices, attitudes, conformity to Christ, and stewardship play a role in shaping one's relationship with God and the outworking of His plans. The integration of Biblical references strengthens the perspective presented from a Christian worldview. The only slight room for improvement would be further elaboration on how God's sovereignty and human free will interact in the context of influencing His plans, but overall, this is an excellent response."
