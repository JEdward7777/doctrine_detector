It effectively expands upon the given answer by delving into various aspects such as obedience, prayer, heart posture, choices, attitudes, conforming to Christ, and stewardship, all viewed through a Christian-specific worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern raised and offers a solid theological foundation to support the assertions made. It could benefit from more direct references to specific Bible verses to strengthen the argument further. Great job overall!"
