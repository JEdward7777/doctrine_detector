What a rich and complex question!

In the context of worship, "divine glory" refers to the majesty, splendor, and beauty of God's character, nature, and actions. It is the manifestation of His divine attributes, such as holiness, righteousness, love, and power. When we speak of God's glory, we are acknowledging that He is a God worthy of worship, praise, and adoration.

In Scripture, God's glory is often associated with His presence (Exodus 33:18-23; Isaiah 6:1-5). Whenever God appears or reveals Himself to humanity, it is often accompanied by a manifestation of His glory. This can take many forms, such as light (Exodus 13:21), fire (Deuteronomy 4:24), or a voice that thunders (Psalm 29:3).

In worship, acknowledging God's glory means recognizing and affirming His supremacy, majesty, and beauty. It is an expression of our awe, reverence, and devotion to Him. When we say "God is glorious," we are not only acknowledging His power and wisdom but also His goodness, love, and justice.

There are several ways we can understand God's glory in the context of worship:

1. Holiness: God's glory is often linked with His holiness. This means that He is set apart from all else as a unique, righteous, and just God.
2. Beauty: Scripture describes God's glory as beautiful (Psalm 29:2; Isaiah 60:1). This beauty is not just a physical attractiveness but also a manifestation of His character, which is pleasing to us.
3. Majesty: When we speak of God's glory, we are acknowledging His majesty and power. This is the awe-inspiring nature of who He is and what He has done.
4. Love: Despite His holiness and majesty, God's love is a fundamental aspect of His glory. This is seen in His relationship with Israel (Isaiah 43:1-7) and ultimately in the redemption of humanity through Jesus Christ (John 17:5).
5. Revelation: God's glory is often revealed or manifested in various ways throughout Scripture, such as in the Tabernacle (Exodus 25:8), the Temple (Ezekiel 40:2-6), and the Person of Jesus Christ (John 1:14; 2 Corinthians 4:6).

In worship, acknowledging God's glory means recognizing His presence, power, love, and beauty. It is an expression of our gratitude, adoration, and submission to Him. As we worship, we are saying, "You are the magnificent, majestic, loving, and beautiful God, worthy of all praise and honor."
