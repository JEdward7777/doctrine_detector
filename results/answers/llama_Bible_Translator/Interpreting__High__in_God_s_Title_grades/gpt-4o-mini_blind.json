The student provides a thorough explanation supported by scriptural references and theological insights, highlighting key attributes of God such as sovereignty, omnipotence, eternalness, and holiness. The response is well-structured, clear, and effectively conveys the significance of the term \"high\" in describing God's exalted and supreme nature. Great job!"
