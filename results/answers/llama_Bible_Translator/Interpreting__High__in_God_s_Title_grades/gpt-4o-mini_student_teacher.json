They correctly emphasized that the term signifies God's greatness, authority, and supremacy over all things, aligning closely with the reference answer from a Christian worldview. The student effectively addressed the concern of avoiding misconceptions about God's nature by highlighting the metaphorical and symbolic use of descriptive titles when describing God."
