## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The name "Israel" has significant meaning and importance in the biblical context. In Genesis 32:28, God renames Jacob, who was previously known as a deceiver (Genesis 27:1-40), to Israel after wrestling with Him. This renaming is a profound moment in the biblical narrative.

In Hebrew, the name "Israel" is written as Yisra'el, which consists of two components: "Yisr" and "El." "Yisr" likely comes from the verb "sara," meaning "to strive" or "to wrestle," while "El" is a common divine epithet, meaning "God" or "the Almighty."

Therefore, the name "Israel" can be translated as "he who strives with God" or "the one who has striven with God." This new name reflects Jacob's transformed character and his newfound reliance on God after their intense struggle.

In the biblical context, the name "Israel" is not just a personal name but also becomes a collective identity for the descendants of Jacob. The term "Israelite" (Hebrew: Yiśra'élî) refers to those who are part of this larger family or nation, emphasizing their connection to God and their covenant relationship with Him.

Throughout the Old Testament, the name "Israel" is often used to describe the entire nation, while "Jacob" specifically refers to Jacob's descendants. The name "Israel" carries significant theological meaning, highlighting the covenantal relationship between God and His people, as well as their shared struggle against the forces of darkness and their ultimate triumph through faith in God.

In a broader sense, the name "Israel" can be seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the "Savior of Israel" (Luke 2:25-26). This highlights the connection between the Old Testament promises made to the nation of Israel and their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the Messiah.
