The offer of wine mixed with myrrh (also known as gall or posca) in Matthew 27:34, Mark 15:23, and John 19:28-30 is an interesting aspect of Jesus' crucifixion. In this situation, Roman soldiers are offering Jesus a bitter concoction to drink, which was often given to slaves and prisoners to sustain them during their hard labor.

From a Christian perspective, the offer of wine mixed with myrrh serves as a symbol of Jesus' humanity and his willingness to share in the suffering of humanity. By refusing the drink, Jesus is demonstrating that he is not seeking to escape or minimize his suffering, but rather, he is willingly embracing it for our salvation.

This act also highlights Jesus' commitment to fulfilling God's plan, even when faced with extreme physical and emotional pain. The Roman soldiers may have seen Jesus as a mere mortal who would be desperate to alleviate his suffering, but by refusing the drink, Jesus shows that he is not just a human being; he is the Son of God, who has come to give his life as an offering for our sins.

Furthermore, this incident underscores Jesus' solidarity with humanity. By choosing not to take the drink, Jesus is identifying himself with those who suffer and are marginalized, even in their darkest moments. This act of self-denial and sacrifice embodies Jesus' statement in John 12:24, "Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds."

In summary, the offer of wine mixed with myrrh emphasizes Jesus' humanity, his commitment to fulfilling God's plan, and his solidarity with those who suffer. By refusing this bitter drink, Jesus is demonstrating his willingness to bear our sins and become the ultimate sacrifice for our salvation.
