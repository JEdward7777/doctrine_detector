  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly addresses the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, providing biblical context and explanation for Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life.\" The writer demonstrates a good understanding of the Old Testament background and Jewish cultural context, which helps to clarify Jesus' claim. They also provide a clear explanation of what Jesus meant by being the Resurrection and the Life, highlighting His power to bring new life and restoration.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from more explicit connection to Christian theology and doctrine. While the writer does touch on the implications for salvation and eternity, they could further develop these ideas and explicitly tie them to Christian belief. Nevertheless, this response provides a strong foundation for understanding Jesus' statement and its significance in Christian faith.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a high level of biblical knowledge and theological understanding, but could benefit from more explicit connection to Christian doctrine and implications for the reader's faith."
