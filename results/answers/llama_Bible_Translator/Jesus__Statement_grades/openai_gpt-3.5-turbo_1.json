  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of Jesus' statement, \"I am the Resurrection and the Life,\" addressing the concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection accurately. The integration of Old Testament background, cultural context, and theological implications demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of Jesus' words. The response effectively highlights the deeper meaning behind Jesus' declaration and how it shapes our faith and understanding of salvation. The only minor improvement could be more direct references to specific verses or passages to further strengthen the argument. Overall, a very well-done interpretation from a Christian worldview perspective."
