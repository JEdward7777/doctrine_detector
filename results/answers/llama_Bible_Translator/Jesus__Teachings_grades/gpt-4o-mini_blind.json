  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings, covering the aspects of affirmation, confirmation, and emphasis effectively. It correctly explains the significance of the term in Jewish tradition and ties it back to Jesus' teachings in a meaningful way. The student's understanding and analysis showcase a solid grasp of the topic. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more references to specific Bible verses where Jesus used the term \"amen\" to further support the points made."
