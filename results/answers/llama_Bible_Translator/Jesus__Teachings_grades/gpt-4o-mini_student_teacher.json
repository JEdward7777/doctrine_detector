  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful explanation of how Jesus used the term \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings, drawing from various examples from Scripture. The student effectively highlighted the significance and importance of Jesus' use of \"amen\" in affirming, confirming, and emphasizing His teachings. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and effectively connects Jesus' use of \"amen\" to the authority of His words in Scripture. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly referencing the teacher's answer and explicitly connecting Jesus' use of \"amen\" to the truth of what He said, as indicated in the reference answer."
