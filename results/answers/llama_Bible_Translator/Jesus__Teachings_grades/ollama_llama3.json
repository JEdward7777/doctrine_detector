  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of Jesus' use of the term \"amen\" in Scripture, including its importance in Jewish tradition and its various functions (affirmation, confirmation, emphasis) in Jesus' teachings. The response also highlights how Jesus used \"amen\" to underscore the significance and authenticity of His teachings.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement. While the response mentions that Jesus often used \"amen\" to emphasize the truth of what He said, it does not fully develop this point or explore its implications for recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. The response also could have more explicitly emphasized how Jesus' use of \"amen\" reflects His divine authority and underscores the importance of believing and obeying His teachings.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response could have more thoroughly engaged with the concern about recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture."
