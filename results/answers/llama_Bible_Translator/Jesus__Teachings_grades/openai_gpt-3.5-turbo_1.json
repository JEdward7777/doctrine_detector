The inclusion of specific passages from the Bible and explanations of how \"Amen\" was used to affirm, confirm, and emphasize different teachings demonstrates a strong understanding of Jesus' authority. The response effectively shows how Jesus' use of \"Amen\" underscores the significance and authenticity of His teachings, aligning well with Christian beliefs about the authority of Jesus' words. Great job!"
