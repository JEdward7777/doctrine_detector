It effectively recognizes the authority of Jesus' teachings as coming from God Himself, aligning well with a Christian worldview perspective on the importance of Jesus' words in Scripture. Additionally, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of \"Amen\" in conveying the authenticity and weight of Jesus' statements. Great job!"
