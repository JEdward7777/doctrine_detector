## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In Scripture, Jesus used the Aramaic word "Amen" (Hebrew: אמן) to emphasize His teachings and statements of affirmation. The Greek New Testament translates this word as "amen" or "verily" (Greek: ἀμήν). This term held significant importance in Jewish tradition, where it was often used to express solemn agreement, confirmation, or even a sense of awe.

Jesus employed the term "Amen" in various ways:

1. **Affirmation**: Jesus would sometimes say "amen" at the beginning or end of a statement to emphasize its truthfulness. For example, Matthew 5:18 says, "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall disappear from the Law, until all is accomplished." Here, Jesus affirms His teaching about the permanence of God's law.

2. **Confirmation**: Jesus would also use "amen" to confirm what He was saying. For instance, in Matthew 8:12, Jesus says, "The healthy do not need a doctor, but the sick do need one. I tell you the truth (amen), the Son of Man came not to heal those already whole, but to call sinners to repentance." Here, Jesus emphasizes His mission and purpose.

3. **Emphasis**: Jesus would occasionally use "amen" to add emphasis to a statement. For example, in Matthew 6:2, He says, "So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do, but rather honor the Father in heaven. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. Amen I say to you." Here, Jesus emphasizes the importance of humility and sincerity in one's charitable actions.

In each instance, Jesus' use of "amen" served to underscore the significance and authenticity of His teachings. It was a way for Him to emphasize that what He said was not only true but also came from God Himself.

As we seek to follow Jesus' example in our own lives, let us remember His words: "Amen I say to you." May they serve as a reminder to speak truthfully and with conviction, just as our Lord did.
