Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is often referred to as our High Priest (Hebrews 2:17, 3:1, 4:14-15, 5:5-6, 7:26, 8:1-6, 9:11-12). This title highlights His unique role in relation to the Levitical priesthood, which was established by God through Moses (Exodus 28-29, Leviticus 8-10).

As our High Priest, Jesus has several key characteristics and responsibilities:

1. Intercessory priest: Jesus intercedes on behalf of humanity before God, offering prayers that are effective for us (Hebrews 5:7, Romans 8:34).
2. Sacrificial lamb: Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice for human sin, offered once and for all through His death on the cross (Hebrews 9:26-28, Romans 3:25, Ephesians 5:1-2). This sacrifice has taken the place of all other animal sacrifices, making them unnecessary (Hebrews 10:1-14).
3. Mediator: Jesus acts as a mediator between God and humanity, facilitating communication and reconciliation (1 Timothy 2:5, Hebrews 8:6-7, Romans 8:34).

The implications of Jesus being our High Priest are significant:

* Human priests' sacrifices are no longer necessary or effective. The Old Testament sacrificial system was temporary and incomplete, serving as a shadow of things to come (Hebrews 9:1-10, 23-28). With Jesus' sacrifice, the need for animal sacrifices has been fulfilled.
* Our relationship with God is now direct, through faith in Christ. We no longer need human priests or intermediaries; we can approach God's throne boldly and confidently (Ephesians 2:18, Hebrews 4:14-16).
* Jesus' sacrifice is complete and final, providing eternal redemption for those who put their trust in Him. There is no need for additional sacrifices or offerings, as all our sins are forgiven through Christ's once-and-for-all payment.

In summary, Jesus' role as our High Priest emphasizes His unique position as the ultimate Sacrifice and Mediator between God and humanity. This truth undermines the necessity of human priests and animal sacrifices, highlighting the sufficiency and completeness of Christ's sacrifice for our salvation.
