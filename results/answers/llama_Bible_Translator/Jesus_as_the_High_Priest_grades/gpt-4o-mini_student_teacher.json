  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively explores the theological implications of Jesus fulfilling the role of high priest by referencing key passages from the New Testament. The answer demonstrates a strong understanding of Jesus' unique role as the ultimate High Priest and Sacrifice. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly stating that Jesus is the Great High Priest who offered himself as the only sacrifice that could take away the sin of all people, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
