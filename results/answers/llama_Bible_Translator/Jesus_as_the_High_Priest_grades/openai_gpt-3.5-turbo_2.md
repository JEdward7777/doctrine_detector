What a great question!

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is often described in relation to the high priesthood, highlighting His unique role as both High Priest and Sacrifice. Here are some key passages:

1. **Hebrews 3:1**: The author of Hebrews calls Jesus "the apostle and high priest of our confession." This emphasizes His authority and mediation on behalf of humanity.
2. **Hebrews 5:1-6**: Jesus is described as a High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, who was a mysterious figure in Genesis 14:17-20. This passage highlights Jesus' divine appointment as High Priest, emphasizing His eternal and unchangeable priesthood (Hebrews 7:23-28).
3. **Hebrews 7:26**: Jesus is called "the guarantor of a better covenant" (NKJV) or "the mediator of a better covenant" (ESV). This phrase underscores His role as the one who makes possible a new and superior covenant between God and humanity.
4. **Hebrews 9:11-28**: In this passage, Jesus is described as the true Tabernacle and High Priest, offering Himself as the sacrifice for sins once and for all (Hebrews 9:12). This emphasizes His unique role in effecting redemption and reconciliation between God and humanity.
5. **John 17:1-26**: In Jesus' high priestly prayer to the Father, He asks that those who believe in Him may be brought into a unity with the Father, just as He is one with the Father (John 17:20-23). This passage highlights His role as Intercessor and Mediator between God and humanity.

Throughout these passages, Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate High Priest, offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice for sins, and mediating between God and humanity. His priesthood is characterized by its eternal nature, divine appointment, and unparalleled effectiveness in securing redemption and reconciliation.
