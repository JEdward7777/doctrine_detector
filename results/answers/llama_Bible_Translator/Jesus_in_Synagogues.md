## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the New Testament, Jesus engaged with the synagogue in several ways during his ministry:

1. Attendance: Jesus regularly attended synagogue services, as evidenced by Luke 4:16-21 and John 6:59. As a Jewish rabbi, he would have been familiar with the Jewish scriptures and traditions.
2. Reading and teaching: Jesus was known to read from the scroll of Isaiah (Luke 4:16-21) and teach in the synagogue on occasion. This was a common practice among rabbis at the time, as recorded in Luke 6:46 and Mark 1:21.
3. Controversy and confrontation: However, Jesus' teachings often led to controversy and confrontation with synagogue authorities. He challenged their traditions and interpretations of Scripture (Matthew 9:35-38; 12:2-8), which sometimes resulted in his being ostracized or expelled from the synagogue (John 9:22; 12:42).
4. Healing and miracles: Jesus also performed healings and miracles within the synagogue, as recorded in Mark 1:23-26 and Luke 13:10-17. These acts of power and compassion may have been seen as a challenge to the authority of the synagogue leaders.
5. Encouraging faith: Jesus' teachings and miracles were often aimed at encouraging faith among the people who attended the synagogue. He emphasized the importance of trusting God and having faith in his promises (Luke 7:1-10; John 4:13-14).

It's essential to note that Jesus' engagement with the synagogue was not without controversy or conflict. As the Messiah, he came to challenge the existing religious structures and bring a new message of salvation. His interactions with the synagogue reflect this tension between his teachings and those of the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders.

In light of these accounts, we can conclude that Jesus engaged with the synagogue in various ways, from attending services and teaching to challenging traditions and performing miracles. His ultimate goal was to bring people closer to God and reveal himself as the Messiah, rather than simply maintaining the status quo within the synagogue.
