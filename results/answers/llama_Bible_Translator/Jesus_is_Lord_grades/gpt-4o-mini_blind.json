  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85. The answer provides a well-thought-out and comprehensive approach to communicating the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also called 'lord'. The suggestions given are doctrinally sound and emphasize the unique significance of Jesus' lordship while addressing the cultural context and implications effectively. The use of biblical references (1 Corinthians 8:6) and analogies help clarify the distinction between human lords and Jesus' lordship. Some minor improvements could be adding more direct scriptural references to support the points made and ensuring even stronger emphasis on Jesus' divinity and unique role as Lord. Overall, a solid theological perspective is presented in this response."
