The suggestions offered are clear, biblically grounded, and provide a solid framework for communicating the significance of declaring \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders hold similar titles. The proposed rephrasing options are also helpful in conveying the message effectively. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern raised."
