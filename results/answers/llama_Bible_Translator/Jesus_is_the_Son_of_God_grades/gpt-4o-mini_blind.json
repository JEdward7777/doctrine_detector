The suggested alternative translations are thoughtful and considerate of Islamic beliefs. However, the response could have included a clearer emphasis on Jesus' unique and divine nature within the Christian faith, while still maintaining respect for the audience's beliefs. Additionally, there could have been a stronger affirmation of the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God despite the differences in Islamic theology."
