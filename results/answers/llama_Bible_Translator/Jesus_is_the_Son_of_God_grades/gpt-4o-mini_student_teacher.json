  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a thoughtful and respectful approach in addressing the challenge of translating \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context. They provided alternative phrases that convey similar meanings while respecting Islamic beliefs about Jesus. However, the suggested translations deviate from the reference answer of maintaining the original terminology. While the student's translation approach is sensitive, it may dilute the precise theological significance of the original text. A more direct and Biblically accurate translation, accompanied by clear teaching and contextual explanation, would have been ideal to ensure the message is faithfully conveyed without compromise."
