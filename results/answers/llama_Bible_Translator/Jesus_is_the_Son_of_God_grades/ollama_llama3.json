  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of addressing the concern about being Biblically accurate while also considering the cultural context of the Muslim audience. The writer provides three alternative translations that convey the same essence as \"Jesus is the Son of God\" without explicitly referencing sonship, which shows a good understanding of the Islamic perspective on Jesus. The use of words like \"rasul,\" \"abd,\" and \"hubbah\" in Arabic also demonstrates a willingness to adapt the translation to the target audience's language and culture.\n\nThe only area where this response falls short is in its initial suggestion that the translator should maintain the original terminology (\"Jesus is the Son of God\") without providing clear teaching or context. While it is important to be accurate, it is also important to consider how the Muslim audience might receive such a direct translation, especially given their rejection of the concept of Jesus as the Son of God.\n\nOverall, however, this response shows a good balance between accuracy and cultural sensitivity, making it a strong candidate for a high grade."
