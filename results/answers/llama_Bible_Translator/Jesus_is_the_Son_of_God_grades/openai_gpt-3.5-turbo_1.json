However, it could improve by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the Biblical accuracy of the translation and ensuring that the core message of \"Jesus is the Son of God\" is effectively communicated and explained within the cultural context of the target audience. It strikes a good balance between cultural sensitivity and Biblical accuracy, but could further enhance the focus on the latter aspect."
