The suggested translations are respectful and seek to convey the truth of Scripture in a way that is understandable to the target audience. However, there could be a potential concern that by avoiding directly stating \"Son of God,\" the full theological significance of Jesus' relationship with God may not be fully communicated. It is important to ensure that the translated text still accurately reflects the biblical truth and does not compromise essential theological concepts."
