  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-thought-out approach to translating \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context by offering alternative phrases that convey the essence of the statement without directly using the term \"Son of God.\" While the response appropriately addresses the concern of minimizing offense and considering cultural sensitivity, it could have incorporated more emphasis on maintaining the Biblical accuracy and significance of the original text. Overall, the response demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful approach to translation within a Christian-specific worldview."
