As a Christian Bible translator, my primary concern is to convey the truth of Scripture in a way that is both accurate and sensitive to the cultural and religious context of the target audience. When translating "Jesus is the Son of God" into a Muslim context, it's essential to consider the Islamic perspective on Jesus (known as Isa) and the concept of sonship.

In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet sent by Allah, but Muslims reject the idea that he is the Son of God or that he is divine. In fact, Muslims believe that Jesus was merely a human prophet who received revelation from Allah.

To translate "Jesus is the Son of God" in a way that is respectful and understandable to Muslims, you might consider using phrases that convey the same essence without explicitly referencing sonship:

1. "Jesus is a messenger sent by God": This phrase acknowledges Jesus' prophetic role as a messenger from God, which is a concept that Muslims can relate to.
2. "Jesus is a servant of God": This translation emphasizes Jesus' submission to God's will and his role as a servant or instrument of God's plan.
3. "Jesus is the beloved of God": This phrase conveys Jesus' special relationship with God, emphasizing his unique status as the one who was loved and sent by God.

When translating these phrases into Arabic (the language of the Quran), you might consider using words like "rasul" (messenger) or "abd" (servant) to convey the same concepts. For example:

* "Jesus is a rasul sent by Allah" (Jesus is a messenger sent by God)
* "Jesus is an 'abd of Allah" (Jesus is a servant of God)
* "Jesus is the hubbah of Allah" (Jesus is the beloved of God)

Keep in mind that these translations should be approached with sensitivity and respect for the Muslim audience. Avoid using language that might be perceived as offensive or provocative, as this could create unnecessary barriers to understanding.

Ultimately, the goal of translation is not only to convey the literal meaning of Scripture but also to communicate its truth and relevance to a specific cultural context. By using language that is both accurate and respectful, you can help Muslims understand the significance of Jesus' message in their own terms.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response addresses the concern of ensuring Biblical accuracy and explaining the meaning of the original text in an appropriate way. The suggestions provided for translating "Jesus is the Son of God" into a Muslim context are respectful and aim to convey the essence of the original message while being sensitive to the audience's beliefs. However, maintaining the original terminology could potentially lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations, especially in a context where the concept of Jesus as the Son of God is understood differently. It would have been beneficial to provide more emphasis on clearly explaining the theological significance of Jesus being the Son of God in a way that may challenge and potentially transform the audience's understanding, while still maintaining respect and sensitivity.
