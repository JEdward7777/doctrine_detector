  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer citing relevant Bible passages and summarizing key teachings on how Christians should judge each other. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview and the concern of approaching relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner. However, there is room for improvement by more directly addressing the specific instruction of not judging harshly or condemning one another as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Integrating this key point more prominently would strengthen the student's response."
