What a great question!

In the New Testament, we find several passages that address the topic of judging others. As Christians, it's essential for us to understand these instructions so that we can effectively love and serve one another.

Here are some key teachings:

1. **Don't judge:** Jesus taught us not to judge others (Matthew 7:1-2). He said, "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." This instruction is a call to humility and self-reflection, rather than trying to scrutinize others.

2. **Judge ourselves first:** Before judging others, we should examine our own lives and behaviors (1 Corinthians 4:3-5). Paul writes, "I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself. My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me." This passage emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and accountability.

3. **Leave judgment to God:** The Bible reminds us that only God can truly see into our hearts and know our motivations (Romans 2:16; John 12:47). As humans, we are not capable of accurately judging others' spiritual state or intentions. This instruction encourages humility and trust in God's sovereignty.

4. **Focus on your own life:** Instead of focusing on others, the Bible urges us to focus on our own lives and spiritual growth (Romans 14:12; 1 Corinthians 3:18). Paul writes, "So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God." This emphasis is on personal accountability and sanctification.

5. **Judge with love and mercy:** When we do need to address issues or behaviors in others, the Bible encourages us to do so with love, compassion, and a desire to restore (Matthew 18:15-20; Galatians 6:1). This approach is characterized by humility, empathy, and a willingness to forgive.

In summary, the Bible teaches Christians not to judge others, but rather to focus on their own lives, leaving judgment to God. When we do need to address issues or behaviors in others, we should do so with love, compassion, and a desire to restore.
