The response emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for salvation and the evaluation of works in light of God's grace. The student could further enhance the answer by emphasizing the centrality of Christ's atonement in the judgment process and the ultimate sovereignty of God in administering justice. Additionally, linking the concept of judgment to the broader narrative of redemption and restoration in Christian theology would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic."
