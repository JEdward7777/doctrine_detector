## [Answer](../Judgment_Criteria.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Day of Judgment! A solemn and profound topic in Christian theology.

According to Scripture, on the Day of Judgment, God will judge every individual who has ever lived based on their response to His revealed truth. Here's a brief overview of how this process will unfold:

**The Great White Throne Judgment (Revelation 20:4-6)**

1. **Separation**: The righteous (those who have trusted in Jesus Christ as their Savior) will be separated from the wicked (those who have rejected God's offer of salvation).
2. **Books opened**: The Book of Life, which contains the names of all believers throughout history, and the Books of Works, which contain a record of every individual's deeds, will be opened.
3. **Judgment**: Those whose names are not found in the Book of Life (the wicked) will be cast into the lake of fire, also known as hell or Gehenna.

**The Judgment Seat of Christ (Romans 14:10-12; 2 Corinthians 5:10)**

1. **Believers only**: Only those who have trusted in Jesus Christ as their Savior will stand before God's judgment seat.
2. **Works evaluated**: Every believer's works, which are the good deeds they've done in response to God's grace, will be evaluated.
3. **Reward or loss**: Based on their faithfulness and obedience, believers will either receive rewards (1 Corinthians 3:10-15; Matthew 25:14-30) or suffer loss of some kind.

**The Purpose of Judgment**

God's judgment is not to condemn humanity but to vindicate His justice and demonstrate His holy character. The Day of Judgment is a time when God, in His mercy and love, will separate the righteous from the wicked, reward believers for their faithfulness, and glorify those who have trusted in Him.

As Christians, we must take the message of judgment seriously, recognizing that our eternal destiny hangs in the balance. May we respond to God's offer of salvation with repentance and faith, trusting Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord.
