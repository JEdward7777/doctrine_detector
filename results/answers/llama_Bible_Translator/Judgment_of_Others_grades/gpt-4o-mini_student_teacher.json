  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer that accurately reflects Jesus' teaching on self-reflection, humility, and loving others. They demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical passage and effectively applied it to the concern regarding hypocrisy and our witness as Christians. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly reference the specific Bible passage mentioned in the reference answer (Luke 6:41-42) for a more precise connection. Overall, an excellent response."
