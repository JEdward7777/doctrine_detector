This is a great question that gets at the heart of Jesus' teaching on self-reflection, humility, and loving one another.

In Matthew 7:3-5, Jesus teaches us to examine ourselves before pointing out the flaws in others. He says:

"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye when you yourself are full of sawdust? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the sawdust out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly enough to remove the speck from your brother's eye."

Here, Jesus emphasizes the importance of self-examination before pointing out flaws in others. He encourages us to recognize our own shortcomings (the "plank" or major fault) before focusing on the minor faults ("specks") of someone else.

Jesus is teaching us that:

1. We should focus on our own spiritual growth and improvement rather than trying to correct others.
2. When we point out flaws in others, it's often a reflection of our own inner struggles and insecurities.
3. By dealing with our own faults first, we'll be more humble, loving, and merciful towards others.

In essence, Jesus is saying that we should practice self-reflection and humility before pointing out the shortcomings of others. This doesn't mean we avoid confronting sin or calling people to repentance altogether; rather, it means we approach these conversations with a sense of accountability and compassion, recognizing our own need for forgiveness and growth.

So, let's take Jesus' teaching to heart: Let us examine ourselves, remove the plank from our own eye, and then – with a clear conscience and a humble spirit – lovingly help others address their own flaws.
