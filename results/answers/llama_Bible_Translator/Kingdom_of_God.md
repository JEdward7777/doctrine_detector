## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In my opinion, as a Christian Bible translator, I believe that the term "Kingdom of God" should be translated in a way that conveys its essence and significance to the target culture. While it's true that the concept of a kingdom may not be familiar to some cultures, we must consider the broader biblical context and the central message of the gospel.

The Kingdom of God is not just a political entity but a spiritual reality that represents God's reign over all creation. It's the domain where God's will is done, and his people are invited to participate in it. In many cultures, the concept of "kingdom" may be unfamiliar, but they might have equivalent concepts like "reign," "rule," or "dominion." These can serve as a starting point for translation.

In Matthew 13:24-30, Jesus teaches about the Kingdom of God using parables that are not specific to Western cultural contexts. Similarly, in Mark 4:26-29 and Luke 17:20-21, Jesus emphasizes the importance of recognizing and participating in God's kingdom, rather than focusing on a particular political or territorial understanding.

When translating for cultures with no concept of kingdoms, we might consider using phrases that convey the idea of God's reign or rule over creation. For example:

* "Kingdom" could be translated as "Rule of God" or "Domain of God."
* "Come into my kingdom" (Matthew 5:3) might become "Enter into God's rule" or "Join God's domain."
* "The Kingdom is near" (Matthew 4:17, Mark 1:15) could be rendered as "God's reign is at hand" or "God's rule is near."

Ultimately, the goal of Bible translation is to convey the truth and message of Scripture in a way that is understandable and relevant to the target culture. While cultural nuances must be considered, we should strive to preserve the essential meaning and theological significance of the original text.

In conclusion, while it may not be advisable to directly translate "Kingdom of God" in all cultures without kingdoms, we can use equivalent concepts or phrases that convey the essence of God's reign and rule over creation. This will enable readers from diverse cultural backgrounds to grasp the core message of the gospel and respond to Jesus' invitation to enter into God's domain.
