  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The answer presents a thoughtful and well-reasoned approach to translating the concept of the \"Kingdom of God\" into cultures without a concept of kingdoms. The student effectively explains the spiritual significance of the Kingdom of God and offers appropriate alternatives for translation while maintaining the doctrinal integrity of the term. The response is well-supported with biblical references and cultural sensitivity, making it a strong and comprehensive argument. Great job!"
