  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-reasoned response that engages with the concern raised about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' through rephrasing. The student demonstrates an understanding of the importance of conveying the essence and significance of the term to the target culture while highlighting the spiritual reality and broader biblical context of the concept. However, the student's suggestion to use equivalent concepts like \"Rule of God\" or \"Domain of God\" may still fall short of fully retaining the specific theological and eschatological significance of the term 'Kingdom of God,' as recommended by the reference answer. The student could strengthen their response by emphasizing the need to provide explanations about the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term 'Kingdom of God' alongside translation efforts."
