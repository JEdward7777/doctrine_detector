The concern about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term is valid, and the response addresses this concern by emphasizing the importance of conveying the essence of God's reign and rule over creation. While the suggested rephrasing options are helpful in making the concept more accessible to cultures without a kingdom context, the response could have elaborated more on how to maintain the depth and biblical context of the term in translation. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the importance of preserving the theological significance of the term while making it relevant to diverse cultural contexts."
