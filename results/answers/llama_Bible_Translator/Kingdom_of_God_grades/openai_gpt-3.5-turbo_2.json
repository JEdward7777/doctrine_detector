  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned and thoughtful approach to translating the term \"Kingdom of God\" while considering cultural nuances. The suggestion to use equivalent concepts or phrases that convey the essence of God's reign is appropriate. However, there is a slight compromise on retaining the term itself, which could potentially impact the depth and biblical context associated with it. Overall, the response demonstrates a good balance between contextualization and preserving the essential meaning of the term."
