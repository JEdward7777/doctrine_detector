  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the term \"Kingdom of God\" and offers well-thought-out alternatives for translation while still emphasizing its spiritual and theological depth. It takes into consideration the biblical context and the importance of conveying the original meaning to the target culture. While the rephrasing suggestions are helpful, there is a slight risk that some depth and nuance could be lost in translation, hence a slightly lower grade."
