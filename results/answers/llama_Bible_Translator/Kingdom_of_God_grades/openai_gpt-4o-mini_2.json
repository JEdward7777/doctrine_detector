  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided a well-thought-out perspective on translating the term \"Kingdom of God\" for cultures without a concept of kingdoms. While the suggested rephrasing was sensitive to cultural differences, there was a risk of losing the deep spiritual and eschatological significance associated with the term. It is important to ensure that any translation retains the essence and theological depth of the original term. Further exploration or acknowledgment of this concern could improve the response."
