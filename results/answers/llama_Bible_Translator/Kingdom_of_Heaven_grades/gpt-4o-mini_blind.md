What a great question!

In the original Greek text of Matthew, the phrase "basileia tōn ouranōn" (βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν) is indeed translated as "kingdom of heaven." Retaining this term is important for several reasons:

1. **Heavenly focus**: The use of "heaven" instead of "earth" emphasizes the ultimate and eternal nature of God's kingdom. Heaven represents the realm where God dwells, whereas earth represents the temporary and imperfect world we live in. This distinction highlights that the Kingdom of God is not limited to this present age but transcends it.
2. **Connection to Israel's hope**: In Jewish tradition, heaven was often seen as the place where God's throne was located (Isaiah 6:1-5; Psalm 11:4). By using "heaven," Jesus likely drew on these associations, implying that his message was an extension of Israel's hope for a Messiah who would establish God's kingdom.
3. **Divine revelation**: The term "heaven" conveys the idea that the Kingdom of God is not just a human construct but a divine reality. It suggests that this kingdom is not something that can be achieved by human effort alone, but rather it is a gift from above, revealed and declared by God.
4. **Distinction from human kingdoms**: By using "heaven" instead of "earth," Jesus distinguishes his Kingdom from human kingdoms, which are characterized by power struggles, corruption, and impermanence. The Kingdom of Heaven represents a realm where God's will is done, and humanity can experience true peace, justice, and harmony.
5. **Eschatological significance**: The phrase "kingdom of heaven" has eschatological implications, hinting at the ultimate consummation of all things when Jesus returns to establish His eternal kingdom (Revelation 21:1-22:5). It anticipates a future time when God's will is fully realized on earth as it is in heaven.

In summary, retaining the term "heaven" in Matthew's Kingdom of Heaven emphasizes the eternal, divine, and eschatological nature of Jesus' message. It highlights that the Kingdom of God is not just a human achievement but a reality revealed by God Himself.
