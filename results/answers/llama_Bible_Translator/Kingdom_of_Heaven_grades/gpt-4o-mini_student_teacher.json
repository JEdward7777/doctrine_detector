  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student provides a detailed and well-structured response that thoroughly explores various reasons for the importance of retaining the term 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' in the book of Matthew. They offer clear connections to the text, theological implications, and the broader biblical context. The student effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating an understanding of the unique terminology used in the gospels and how it aids in grasping the intended messages of the biblical authors.\n\nThe student could have further strengthened their answer by directly referencing Matthew's gospel and its distinctive use of the term 'heaven' in relation to the Kingdom of God, as stated in the reference answer. Additionally, a more explicit incorporation of a Christian-specific worldview in their interpretation could have enhanced the depth of their response. Overall, a well-reasoned and insightful answer."
