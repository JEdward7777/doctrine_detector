  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern about understanding unique terminology in the gospels, particularly the use of \"heaven\" in Matthew's Kingdom of Heaven. The writer provides a thorough explanation of the significance of this term, drawing from biblical references and theological implications.\n\nWhile the answer does not directly match the provided one (e.g., it is distinctive to Matthew's gospel), the response still demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept and its relevance to understanding Jesus' message. The discussion of the eternal, divine, and eschatological nature of God's kingdom in Matthew adds depth and insight to the topic.\n\nTo receive a perfect score, the writer could have more explicitly connected their explanation to the concern about unique terminology used in the gospels. Nevertheless, this response is well-written, well-structured, and demonstrates a strong grasp of biblical theology, making it deserving of a high grade."
