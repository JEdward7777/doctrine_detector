It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theological implications and how this phrase is unique to Matthew's gospel. The Christian worldview is well-applied in explaining the divine, eschatological, and heavenly aspects of the Kingdom of God, aligning with the concern of understanding the terminology used in the gospels to grasp the authors' intended messages. Great job!"
