It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how understanding the unique terminology in the gospels can deepen our comprehension of biblical messages. The explanation is well-supported with theological insights, scriptural references, and implications for eschatology, emphasizing the eternal and divine nature of God's kingdom in Matthew."
