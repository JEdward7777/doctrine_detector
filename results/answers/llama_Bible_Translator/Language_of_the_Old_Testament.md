## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, specifically in Biblical Hebrew. This includes the Pentateuch (Genesis to Deuteronomy), the Historical Books (Joshua to Esther), the Wisdom Literature (Job to Song of Solomon), and the Prophetic Books (Isaiah to Malachi).

Some portions of the Old Testament were written in Aramaic, which was a common language spoken by Jews during the Babylonian exile. The books that contain Aramaic texts are:

1. Daniel 2:4b-7:28
2. Ezra 4:8-6:18
3. Jeremiah 10:11

However, even in these Aramaic passages, the underlying text is still Hebrew.
