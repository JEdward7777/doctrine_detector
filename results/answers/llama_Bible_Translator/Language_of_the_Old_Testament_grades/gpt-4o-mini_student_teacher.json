  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate answer, demonstrating a deep understanding of the language origins of the Old Testament. They correctly identified Hebrew as the primary language, and also acknowledged the presence of Aramaic sections in specific books. The additional detail on which books contain Aramaic texts shows a comprehensive knowledge of the subject matter. Overall, an excellent response that aligns well with the Christian worldview and the importance of understanding the original context of Scripture."
