  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately states that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is essential knowledge for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context. The additional information provided about the use of Aramaic during the Babylonian exile adds depth to the response. However, the response does not fully address the concern by failing to explicitly explain why this knowledge is crucial for understanding the Scriptures.\n\nThe response scores high marks because it correctly conveys the primary fact and provides some supporting details. To receive a perfect score, the response would need to explicitly demonstrate the significance of knowing the original language in which the Old Testament was written, such as explaining how it informs our interpretation of texts or allows us to better understand cultural references."
