## Correct Answer

## Stated Concern
This knowledge is essential for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context.

## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, specifically in Biblical Hebrew. This includes the Pentateuch (Genesis to Deuteronomy), the Historical Books (Joshua to Esther), the Wisdom Literature (Job to Song of Solomon), and the Prophetic Books (Isaiah to Malachi).

Some portions of the Old Testament were written in Aramaic, which was a common language spoken by Jews during the Babylonian exile. The books that contain Aramaic texts are:

1. Daniel 2:4b-7:28
2. Ezra 4:8-6:18
3. Jeremiah 10:11

However, even in these Aramaic passages, the underlying text is still Hebrew.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately states that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is essential knowledge for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context. The additional information provided about the use of Aramaic during the Babylonian exile adds depth to the response. However, the response does not fully address the concern by failing to explicitly explain why this knowledge is crucial for understanding the Scriptures.

The response scores high marks because it correctly conveys the primary fact and provides some supporting details. To receive a perfect score, the response would need to explicitly demonstrate the significance of knowing the original language in which the Old Testament was written, such as explaining how it informs our interpretation of texts or allows us to better understand cultural references.
