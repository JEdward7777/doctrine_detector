  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is essential for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context. Additionally, the mention of Aramaic sections in the Old Testament shows a deeper understanding of the languages used in the text. However, a slightly higher grade could have been achieved by providing more examples of Aramaic passages apart from Daniel, Ezra, and Jeremiah."
