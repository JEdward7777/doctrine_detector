## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the New Testament, particularly in Acts 2:42-47 and 1 Corinthians 11:17-34, it appears that early believers in a particular city would typically gather together for several types of meetings:

1. The Breaking of Bread (Acts 2:42): This was a regular meeting where believers would come together to share the Lord's Supper (Communion or Eucharist) and celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This meeting was often held in homes, as mentioned in Acts 14:26.
2. Prayer Meetings (Acts 12:5; 16:25): Believers would gather for prayer, praise, and worship, seeking God's guidance, provision, and protection.
3. Teaching and Discipleship (Acts 11:26; 1 Corinthians 15:31): Apostles and other leaders would teach and disciple new believers, helping them to grow in their faith and understanding of the gospel.
4. Corporate Worship (Ephesians 5:18-20; Colossians 3:16): Believers would gather for corporate worship, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, making melody in their hearts to God.

These meetings were often held in homes, as the early church did not have dedicated buildings. The frequency of these gatherings varied from place to place, but they seem to have been a regular part of the believers' lives (Acts 2:46; 5:42).
