However, it lacks depth and specificity, only briefly touching on the Breaking of Bread, Prayer Meetings, Teaching and Discipleship, and Corporate Worship that are described in the New Testament. To better address the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers, the response could provide more concrete examples of how these gatherings contributed to the growth and unity of the early church, as well as offer practical suggestions for contemporary believers to cultivate similar relationships in their own communities."
