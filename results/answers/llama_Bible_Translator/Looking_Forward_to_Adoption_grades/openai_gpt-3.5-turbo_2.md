## [Answer](../Looking_Forward_to_Adoption.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
Romans 8:23 says, "And not only that, but we also joy in sufferings, knowing that suffering produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not disappoint, because God's love has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover as we have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even so we also ourselves are in prison for his sake, and not our own." (NKJV)

The phrase "waiting for the adoption" is not explicitly mentioned in Romans 8:23, but it's related to the concept of being "predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son" (Rom. 8:29). This predestination implies that believers are waiting for the moment when they will be fully adopted as sons and daughters of God.

In Christian theology, adoption is a process where believers are united with Christ by faith and are given the status of being co-heirs with Christ (Gal. 3:26-29; Rom. 8:14-17). This adoption is a promise that is yet to be fully realized in this life but will be completely fulfilled in eternity when we see God face-to-face.

Romans 8:23 implies that believers should joyfully endure sufferings, knowing that these experiences are producing perseverance and character in them. This hope is not based on their own efforts or accomplishments but rather on the fact that God's love has been poured out into their hearts through the Holy Spirit (Rom. 5:5).

For believers, this means that they should:

1. Joyfully endure sufferings as a means of developing perseverance and character.
2. Trust in God's sovereignty and predestination, knowing that He has chosen them to become conformed to the image of His Son.
3. Rest in hope, knowing that their adoption as sons and daughters of God is a promise yet to be fulfilled in eternity.

In summary, Romans 8:23 implies that believers should trust in God's sovereignty and predestination, resting in hope as they wait for the full adoption as sons and daughters of God. This process of growth and transformation is accomplished through suffering, perseverance, character, and ultimately, hope in Jesus Christ.
