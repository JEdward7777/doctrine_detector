  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the Lord's Supper in Christian theology, highlighting its significance as a remembrance of Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross. The response also includes relevant biblical references to support their explanation. However, the answer did not specifically mention the connection to the Passover meal, as emphasized in the reference answer. Therefore, a slight deduction is made for not addressing this specific aspect of the significance of the Lord\u2019s Supper."
