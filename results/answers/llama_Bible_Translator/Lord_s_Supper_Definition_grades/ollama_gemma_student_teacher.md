## [Answer](../Lord_s_Supper_Definition.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Christian theology, the Lord's Supper (also known as Communion or the Eucharist) commemorates and remembers the death of Jesus Christ on the cross for our sins. In particular, it recalls his Last Supper with his disciples before he was betrayed and arrested, which is recorded in the New Testament.

Jesus took bread and wine, gave thanks, broke the bread, and shared it with his disciples, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me." (Luke 22:19) He also took a cup of wine and said, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is shed for you." (Luke 22:20)

By partaking in the Lord's Supper, Christians are reminded of Jesus' sacrifice on their behalf, which paid the price for their sin. It is a symbolic representation of Christ's body and blood, and an opportunity to express gratitude for his redemption and to participate in his sacrifice.

As Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 11:26-27, "For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."
