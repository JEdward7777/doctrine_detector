The biblical references are appropriate and the emphasis on sacrificial love, unity, respect, and God-centered focus is commendable. The answer could have elaborated more on the biblical roles and responsibilities of husbands and wives in marriage, as outlined in Ephesians 5, to further enhance doctrinal correctness. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
