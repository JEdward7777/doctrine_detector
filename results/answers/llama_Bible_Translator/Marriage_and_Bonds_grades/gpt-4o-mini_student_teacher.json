They reference relevant Scriptures and highlight key aspects such as lifelong commitment, submission, unity, respect, and God-centered focus. The response aligns well with promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships. The student effectively conveys the sacred nature of marriage and the responsibilities that come with it. Great job overall!"
