  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and solid explanation from a Christian perspective regarding the sacred nature of marriage as ordained by God. It emphasizes key principles such as lifelong commitment, sacrificial love, unity, respect, care, and keeping God at the center of the relationship. The response effectively promotes strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include specific Bible verses to support each point made, which would enhance the depth of the argument."
