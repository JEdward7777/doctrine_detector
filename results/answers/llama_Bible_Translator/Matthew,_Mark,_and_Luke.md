## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The names of the twelve apostles, also known as disciples, are listed in three books of the Bible:

1. Matthew 10:2-4 - Here, Jesus calls his twelve apostles and appoints them to minister throughout Israel.
2. Mark 3:16-19 - In this passage, Jesus chooses his twelve apostles, naming each one.
3. Luke 6:13-16 - Luke also provides a list of the twelve apostles, with their names.

The lists are not identical in all three books, but they do include most of the same individuals. The discrepancies likely arose from the different theological emphases and purposes of each Gospel writer.

Here's a comparison of the lists:

Matthew 10:2-4:

1. Simon (also called Peter)
2. James son of Zebedee
3. John son of Zebedee
4. Philip
5. Bartholomew
6. Thomas
7. Matthew
8. James son of Alphaeus
9. Simon the Zealot
10. Judas Iscariot
11. Andrew
12. Judas (not Judas Iscariot)

Mark 3:16-19:

1. Simon (Peter)
2. James son of Zebedee
3. John son of Zebedee
4. Andrew
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew
7. Thomas
8. Matthew
9. James son of Alphaeus
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot

Luke 6:13-16:

1. Simon (Peter)
2. James son of Zebedee
3. John son of Zebedee
4. Andrew
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew
7. Thomas
8. Matthew
9. James son of Alphaeus
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot
12. Matthias (replaced Judas)

It's worth noting that Judas Iscariot is omitted from Luke's list, as he had betrayed Jesus and been replaced by Matthias (Acts 1:21-26).
