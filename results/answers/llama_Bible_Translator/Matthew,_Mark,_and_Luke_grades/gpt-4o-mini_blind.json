It correctly highlights the differences in the lists found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, as well as the additional note about Matthias replacing Judas Iscariot. The use of Scripture to support the information given is commendable. However, the response could have been strengthened by emphasizing the significance of the twelve apostles in the broader context of Jesus' ministry and the early church, from a doctrinal perspective."
