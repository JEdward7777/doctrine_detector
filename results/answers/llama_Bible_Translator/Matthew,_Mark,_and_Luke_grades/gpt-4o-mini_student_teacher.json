  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate response, citing specific passages from the Gospels where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. They demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and included additional information about discrepancies in the lists and the replacement of Judas Iscariot. However, they could have directly answered the question by simply stating that the names of the twelve disciples are indeed listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke as per the reference answer provided."
