  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical accounts and provides specific examples from three different Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). The writer clearly explains that the lists of apostles are not identical in all three books but share most of the same individuals. Additionally, they provide context for the discrepancies by noting the different theological emphases and purposes of each Gospel writer.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not explicitly state what teachings or lessons can be learned from these accounts. While it provides a good overview of the lists of apostles, it does not directly address how this information contributes to our understanding of God's plan or the teachings of Jesus Christ. Therefore, while the response demonstrates a good grasp of biblical knowledge, it could be stronger in its connection to Christian theology and application.\n\nComment: This response is well-organized and provides clear explanations of the different lists of apostles found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. To take it to the next level, the writer could explicitly connect this information to Christian teachings or principles."
