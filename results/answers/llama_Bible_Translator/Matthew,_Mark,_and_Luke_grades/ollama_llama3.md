## Question [Matthew, Mark, and Luke](../../../questions/Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md)
In which books of the Bible are the names of the twelve disciples listed?

## Correct Answer
The names of the twelve disciples are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

## Stated Concern
Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings.

## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The names of the twelve apostles, also known as disciples, are listed in three books of the Bible:

1. Matthew 10:2-4 - Here, Jesus calls his twelve apostles and appoints them to minister throughout Israel.
2. Mark 3:16-19 - In this passage, Jesus chooses his twelve apostles, naming each one.
3. Luke 6:13-16 - Luke also provides a list of the twelve apostles, with their names.

The lists are not identical in all three books, but they do include most of the same individuals. The discrepancies likely arose from the different theological emphases and purposes of each Gospel writer.

Here's a comparison of the lists:

Matthew 10:2-4:

1. Simon (also called Peter)
2. James son of Zebedee
3. John son of Zebedee
4. Philip
5. Bartholomew
6. Thomas
7. Matthew
8. James son of Alphaeus
9. Simon the Zealot
10. Judas Iscariot
11. Andrew
12. Judas (not Judas Iscariot)

Mark 3:16-19:

1. Simon (Peter)
2. James son of Zebedee
3. John son of Zebedee
4. Andrew
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew
7. Thomas
8. Matthew
9. James son of Alphaeus
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot

Luke 6:13-16:

1. Simon (Peter)
2. James son of Zebedee
3. John son of Zebedee
4. Andrew
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew
7. Thomas
8. Matthew
9. James son of Alphaeus
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot
12. Matthias (replaced Judas)

It's worth noting that Judas Iscariot is omitted from Luke's list, as he had betrayed Jesus and been replaced by Matthias (Acts 1:21-26).

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 90.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical accounts and provides specific examples from three different Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). The writer clearly explains that the lists of apostles are not identical in all three books but share most of the same individuals. Additionally, they provide context for the discrepancies by noting the different theological emphases and purposes of each Gospel writer.

The only area for improvement is that the response does not explicitly state what teachings or lessons can be learned from these accounts. While it provides a good overview of the lists of apostles, it does not directly address how this information contributes to our understanding of God's plan or the teachings of Jesus Christ. Therefore, while the response demonstrates a good grasp of biblical knowledge, it could be stronger in its connection to Christian theology and application.

Comment: This response is well-organized and provides clear explanations of the different lists of apostles found in Matthew, Mark, and Luke. To take it to the next level, the writer could explicitly connect this information to Christian teachings or principles.
