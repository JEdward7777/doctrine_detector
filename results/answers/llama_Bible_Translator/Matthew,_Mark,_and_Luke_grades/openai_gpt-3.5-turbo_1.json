  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides an accurate and detailed comparison of the lists of the twelve apostles/disciples as presented in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, showing a strong understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings. The explanation of Judas Iscariot's omission from Luke's list and replacement by Matthias demonstrates a good grasp of the theological nuances in the texts. Great work overall!"
