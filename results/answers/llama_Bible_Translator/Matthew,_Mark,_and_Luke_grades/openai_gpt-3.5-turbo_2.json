  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the names of the twelve disciples as listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The comparison of the lists and the explanation for discrepancies show a good understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings. The only minor improvement would be to include a brief mention of the significance of the twelve apostles in relation to Jesus' ministry and the establishment of the early Church."
