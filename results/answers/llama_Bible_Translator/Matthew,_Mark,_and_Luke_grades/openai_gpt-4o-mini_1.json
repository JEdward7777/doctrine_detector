  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the names of the twelve apostles as listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It shows a good understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings. The additional comparison of the apostles' names across the three books and the mention of Judas Iscariot's replacement by Matthias further demonstrate a strong knowledge of the subject matter. This response aligns well with Christian teachings and is well-informed."
