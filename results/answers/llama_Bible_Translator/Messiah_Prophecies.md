## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Old Testament contains many prophecies about the Messiah that Jesus fulfilled. Here are a few examples:

1. The Messiah would be born of a virgin (Isaiah 7:14). Jesus was born to a virgin named Mary through the power of the Holy Spirit (Matthew 1:20-21).

2. The Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah and the house of David (Genesis 49:10; Jeremiah 23:5; Ezekiel 37:24-25; Luke 3:31). Jesus was a descendant of King David through his father Joseph, who was descended from David (Luke 3:31).

3. The Messiah would be a descendant of Abraham and have the same blessing as him (Genesis 12:1-3; Genesis 22:18; Galatians 3:8). Jesus is a direct descendant of Abraham (Matthew 1:1-17) and was blessed by God in many ways, including his life, teachings, and miracles.

4. The Messiah would be called Immanuel, which means "God with us" (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23). Jesus is often referred to as Immanuel in the New Testament, emphasizing his divine nature and presence among humans.

5. The Messiah would be a prophet like Moses, but even greater than him (Deuteronomy 18:15-19; Acts 3:22-26). Jesus performed many miracles and taught with authority, similar to how Moses led Israel out of slavery in Egypt (Matthew 11:20-24).

6. The Messiah would enter Jerusalem as a humble king, riding on a donkey or an ass (Zechariah 9:9; Matthew 21:1-7). Jesus entered Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, riding on a donkey and fulfilling this prophecy.

7. The Messiah would be betrayed by someone close to him (Psalm 41:9; Luke 22:47-48). Jesus was betrayed by Judas Iscariot, one of his twelve apostles.

8. The Messiah would suffer and die on behalf of others, forgiving those who crucified him (Isaiah 53:5-6; Mark 15:34). Jesus suffered and died on the cross to atone for humanity's sins, showing mercy and forgiveness to all who put their faith in him.

9. The Messiah would rise from the dead after three days (Psalm 16:10; Hosea 6:2; Acts 2:31-32). Jesus was raised from the dead on the third day, demonstrating his power over death and sin.

10. The Messiah would sit at God's right hand until he returned to establish a new heaven and earth (Isaiah 9:7; Daniel 7:13-14; Acts 2:33-36). Jesus ascended to heaven after his resurrection, where he sits at the right hand of God, waiting for the time when he will return to judge all humanity and establish a new creation.

These prophecies demonstrate Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament predictions about the Messiah.
