The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian beliefs. However, the response could be further enhanced by expanding on additional prophecies fulfilled by Jesus to provide a more comprehensive understanding of His role as the Messiah. Strengthening the argument with more examples would provide a stronger basis for faith in Jesus as the prophesied Savior."
