However, while the response acknowledges the differences in the Christian view of Jesus as the Messiah compared to other religious perspectives, it could have provided a more explicit and emphatic differentiation to clearly articulate Jesus' divinity and redemption role as the Son of God, fully in line with Christian scripture. Additional emphasis on Jesus as the exclusive savior and the importance of His sacrifice for humanity's salvation would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
