It effectively connects the Old Testament prophecies and messianic expectations with Jesus' fulfillment of these roles. The student demonstrates an understanding of the theological implications of this title, emphasizing Jesus' divine kingship, sacrificial love, and universal significance. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into the specific Messianic passages in the Old Testament and providing more Scriptural references to support each point. Overall, a strong and insightful answer."
