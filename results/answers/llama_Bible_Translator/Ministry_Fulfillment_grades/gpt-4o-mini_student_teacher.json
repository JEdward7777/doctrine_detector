  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and comprehensive answer that aligns with Christian beliefs about fulfilling one's ministry. They effectively referenced the Great Commission and highlighted important aspects of sharing the Gospel, making disciples, teaching, serving, and worshiping in ministry. However, the student's response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern of understanding and executing one's God-given purpose in serving others. The reference answer from the teacher provides a simple and clear definition of fulfilling ministry that the student's response could have incorporated more directly."
