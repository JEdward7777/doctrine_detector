  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately addresses the concern about understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith, and it provides biblical examples and insights to support its claims. The explanation of how miracles can serve as \"signposts\" pointing towards truth is particularly helpful in clarifying their purpose. Additionally, the response acknowledges that even miracles don't guarantee immediate or lasting faith, which adds nuance to its discussion.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are a few minor points:\n\n* While the response provides some biblical examples, it could have delved deeper into Scripture and explored more specific instances of miracles leading people to faith.\n* The language used is generally clear and concise, but there were a few places where the response could have been tightened up (e.g., the transition between discussing the purpose of miracles and explaining how they can prompt questions).\n* While the response does acknowledge that even miracles don't guarantee immediate or lasting faith, it could have more explicitly tied this idea back to its discussion of evangelism and personal faith.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that provides valuable insights into the role of miracles in leading others to faith."
