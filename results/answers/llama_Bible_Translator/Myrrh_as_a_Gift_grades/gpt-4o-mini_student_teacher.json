  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth. The response effectively connects the symbolism of myrrh to Jesus' ultimate sacrifice and role as the Savior, demonstrating a strong understanding of the deeper spiritual implications of the gift. A slight deduction in points is given due to the additional details provided beyond the reference answer, which while enriching, could have been more concise."
