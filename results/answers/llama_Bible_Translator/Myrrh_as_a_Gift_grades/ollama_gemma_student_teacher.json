  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 90\n\n**Comments:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the symbolic significance of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth. The student clearly articulates the connection between the use of myrrh in ancient burial practices and its prophetic foreshadowing of Jesus' sacrificial death. The inclusion of references to John 1:29 and Jesus' dual humanity further strengthens the argument. The overall clarity, depth of analysis, and well-articulated conclusion contribute to a high score."
