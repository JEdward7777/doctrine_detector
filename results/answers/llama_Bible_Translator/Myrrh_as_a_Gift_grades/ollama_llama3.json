  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response not only addresses the concern about understanding the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus but also provides a rich and detailed explanation of the significance of myrrh in Matthew 2:11. The author's analysis is thoughtful, well-organized, and grounded in biblical truth. They effectively demonstrate how the gift of myrrh foreshadows Jesus' ultimate sacrifice on the cross and highlights His role as the Lamb of God who would take away sin.\n\nThe only area for improvement could be to further connect the symbolism of myrrh to Jesus' purpose and mission, making it even clearer how this understanding can deepen one's appreciation of his purpose and mission. However, the response already does an excellent job of demonstrating this connection.\n\nComment: This response is a great example of thoughtful biblical exposition. The author has taken the time to thoroughly explore the symbolism of myrrh in Matthew 2:11 and has provided a compelling argument for its significance in relation to Jesus' purpose and mission."
