The gift of myrrh in Matthew 2:11, along with gold and frankincense, carries great symbolic significance in relation to the true nature and purpose of Jesus Christ. While gold often represents kingship and wealth, frankincense signifies worship and spiritual devotion. Myrrh, however, takes on a more profound meaning.

Myrrh was an expensive and rare spice used primarily for embalming and burial purposes. In ancient times, it was customary to anoint the deceased with myrrh to preserve their bodies. The use of myrrh in Jesus' birth gift is, therefore, a prophetic foreshadowing of His ultimate sacrifice on the cross.

In this context, the gift of myrrh can be seen as a symbolic recognition by the Magi (wise men) that Jesus was not just any ordinary king or prophet. The offering of myrrh implied an awareness of Jesus' future sufferings and death, which would ultimately lead to His resurrection and glorification.

The inclusion of myrrh in this gift emphasizes Jesus' true nature as the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world (John 1:29). It highlights His role as a sacrifice for humanity's redemption, foreshadowing the ultimate purpose of His life, death, and resurrection.

In addition to its symbolic significance, the gift of myrrh may also have been seen as a way to honor Jesus' humanity. As God in human flesh, Jesus would experience physical suffering and death just like humanity. The offering of myrrh acknowledged this aspect of His human nature while simultaneously pointing to His divine purpose.

In summary, the gift of myrrh at Jesus' birth represents the recognition of His sacrificial role in human redemption, foreshadowing His ultimate death and resurrection. It highlights His true nature as the Lamb of God who would take away sin, emphasizing the significance of His life, death, and glorification for humanity's salvation.
