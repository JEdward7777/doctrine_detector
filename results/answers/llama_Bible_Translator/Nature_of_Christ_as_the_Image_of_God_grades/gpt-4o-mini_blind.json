The student effectively references relevant Bible verses and articulates key aspects of Jesus' nature that reflect God. The explanation on the implications for Christian belief is well-developed and connects the concept of Jesus as the image of God to core theological truths such as the gospel message, salvation, Christian identity, and worship. However, to enhance the answer further, the student could delve deeper into the theological implications of Jesus being the image of God, perhaps by exploring the concept of the Trinity and how Jesus as the image of God relates to the Father and the Holy Spirit in the Godhead."
