  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how Jesus is described as the image of God in Christian belief, supported by relevant biblical verses and theological concepts. However, the concern specified that Jesus is the image of God because he is God himself and shares the same essence with God the Father, emphasizing his divinity. The student's response focused more on how Jesus reflects God's character and attributes rather than emphasizing his divine nature. While the student's answer is well-developed and presents a comprehensive understanding of the significance of Jesus as the image of God, it could have better aligned with the specific concern provided."
