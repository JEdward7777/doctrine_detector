What a great question!

According to the New Testament, Christians should approach exhortation (or encouragement) in a manner that is grounded in love, humility, and biblical truth. Here are some key principles:

1. **Love**: As Jesus said, "Love each other as I have loved you" (John 15:12). When we exhort or encourage others, we should do so out of a genuine concern for their well-being and spiritual growth. This means approaching them with kindness, compassion, and patience.
2. **Scripture**: Our primary authority is God's Word, not personal opinions or experiences. Therefore, when exhorting or encouraging others, we should ground our words in biblical truth (1 Peter 3:15-16). This means using Scripture to correct, rebuke, and encourage one another.
3. **Humility**: Exhortation should be done with humility and a willingness to listen (James 1:19-20). We should approach others with an attitude of teachability and a recognition that we are all learners and sinners in need of correction.
4. **Truth**: When exhorting or encouraging others, we should focus on the truth as revealed in Scripture, rather than our own opinions or feelings (John 17:17-18). We should speak the truth in love, even if it's difficult to hear (Ephesians 4:15).
5. **Wisdom**: Exhortation should be done with wisdom, considering the individual's spiritual maturity, circumstances, and context (1 Corinthians 3:1-3). We should not exhort others in a way that is harsh or unloving.
6. **Interdependence**: As believers, we are all part of the same body (1 Corinthians 12:21-22) and are called to encourage one another (Hebrews 10:23-25). Exhortation should be a two-way street, where we both give and receive encouragement.
7. **The Holy Spirit's guidance**: Ultimately, our words and actions should be guided by the Holy Spirit, who is the ultimate encourager (Acts 1:8; John 14:26).

In practice, this means that when we exhort or encourage others:

* We speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15)
* We focus on God's glory and the well-being of others rather than our own interests
* We approach others with humility and a willingness to listen
* We rely on Scripture as our primary authority
* We consider the individual's spiritual maturity, circumstances, and context

By following these principles, we can exhort or encourage others in a manner that is consistent with New Testament teachings and honors God.
