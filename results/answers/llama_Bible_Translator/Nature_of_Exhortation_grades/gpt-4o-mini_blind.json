  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response on how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament. They emphasized important principles such as love, Scripture, humility, truth, wisdom, interdependence, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The answer was doctrinally sound and provided relevant Bible verses to support their points. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included more direct references to specific exhortation passages in the New Testament and examples of how these principles could be practically applied in everyday situations."
