What a great question!

According to the New Testament, Christians should approach exhortation (or encouragement) in a manner that is grounded in love, humility, and biblical truth. Here are some key principles:

1. **Love**: As Jesus said, "Love each other as I have loved you" (John 15:12). When we exhort or encourage others, we should do so out of a genuine concern for their well-being and spiritual growth. This means approaching them with kindness, compassion, and patience.
2. **Scripture**: Our primary authority is God's Word, not personal opinions or experiences. Therefore, when exhorting or encouraging others, we should ground our words in biblical truth (1 Peter 3:15-16). This means using Scripture to correct, rebuke, and encourage one another.
3. **Humility**: Exhortation should be done with humility and a willingness to listen (James 1:19-20). We should approach others with an attitude of teachability and a recognition that we are all learners and sinners in need of correction.
4. **Truth**: When exhorting or encouraging others, we should focus on the truth as revealed in Scripture, rather than our own opinions or feelings (John 17:17-18). We should speak the truth in love, even if it's difficult to hear (Ephesians 4:15).
5. **Wisdom**: Exhortation should be done with wisdom, considering the individual's spiritual maturity, circumstances, and context (1 Corinthians 3:1-3). We should not exhort others in a way that is harsh or unloving.
6. **Interdependence**: As believers, we are all part of the same body (1 Corinthians 12:21-22) and are called to encourage one another (Hebrews 10:23-25). Exhortation should be a two-way street, where we both give and receive encouragement.
7. **The Holy Spirit's guidance**: Ultimately, our words and actions should be guided by the Holy Spirit, who is the ultimate encourager (Acts 1:8; John 14:26).

In practice, this means that when we exhort or encourage others:

* We speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15)
* We focus on God's glory and the well-being of others rather than our own interests
* We approach others with humility and a willingness to listen
* We rely on Scripture as our primary authority
* We consider the individual's spiritual maturity, circumstances, and context

By following these principles, we can exhort or encourage others in a manner that is consistent with New Testament teachings and honors God.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response on how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament. They emphasized important principles such as love, Scripture, humility, truth, wisdom, interdependence, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The answer was doctrinally sound and provided relevant Bible verses to support their points. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included more direct references to specific exhortation passages in the New Testament and examples of how these principles could be practically applied in everyday situations.
