  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nDespite the comprehensive and well-articulated explanation provided by the student, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes the importance of exhortation done in love without being harsh or abrupt. The student's response aligned closely with this foundational principle from the New Testament. However, the student's answer could have been improved by focusing more specifically on the aspect of delivering encouragement in a loving and supportive manner, which was the specified concern. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of biblical principles related to exhortation and provided detailed elaboration on how Christians should approach this practice."
