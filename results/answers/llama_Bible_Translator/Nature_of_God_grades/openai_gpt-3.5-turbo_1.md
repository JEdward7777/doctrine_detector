# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a profound question!

When Jesus says, "God is spirit" (John 4:24), He's not just making a philosophical statement; He's sharing essential truth about the nature of God. In Jewish tradition, people often believed in a deity who was separate from them, a physical entity that could be seen and touched. But Jesus' words challenge this understanding by emphasizing God's spiritual nature.

In this context, "spirit" (Hebrew: ruach) refers to the essence or being of God, which is immaterial, invisible, and eternal. This passage is often paired with John 4:23, where Jesus says, "Yet a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem...but in spirit and in truth." Here, Jesus clarifies that true worship isn't about physical location or rituals but rather about spiritual connection with God.

So, how should this understanding influence our worship?

1. **Spiritual focus**: Recognize that God is not just a powerful being but also a personal, relational Being who desires intimate connection with us. Our worship should be characterized by a deep sense of reverence and awe for His majesty.
2. **Heart-oriented**: True worship isn't about external rituals or performances; it's about the sincerity and authenticity of our hearts. We should come to God with humility, gratitude, and a willingness to listen to His Spirit.
3. **Intimacy over formalism**: Jesus' words encourage us to move beyond mere external forms of worship (e.g., rituals, ceremonies) and seek genuine connection with God's heart. This means prioritizing personal devotions, prayer, and meditation over external expressions of worship.
4. **Authenticity in worship**: Recognize that our worship is not a show or a performance but rather an honest expression of who we are in Christ. We should be free to express ourselves openly and honestly before God, without fear of judgment or pretension.

In summary, Jesus' statement about God being a spirit emphasizes the importance of spiritual connection with Him. This understanding should lead us to prioritize heart-oriented worship, intimacy over formalism, authenticity in our expressions of worship, and a deep reverence for His majesty.
