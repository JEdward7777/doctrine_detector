The explanation is clear and adheres well to Christian doctrine. However, it could be strengthened by further elaborating on the aspect of God's justice and holiness in relation to the existence of hell, as well as the concept of eternal punishment in light of God's mercy and love. Additionally, connecting the doctrine of hell to the broader biblical narrative of redemption and the character of God would enhance the theological depth of the response."
