  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and detailed explanation of the Christian view of hell, supporting it with relevant Scripture references. It accurately conveys the severity and purpose of hell in line with the concern given. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more specific references to Jesus' teachings on hell, but overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
