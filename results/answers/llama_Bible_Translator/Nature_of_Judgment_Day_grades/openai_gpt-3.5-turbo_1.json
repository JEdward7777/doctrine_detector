  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the Christian concept of Judgment Day, supported by relevant biblical references. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of Judgment Day in relation to personal faith and eternal consequences. The only minor point deduction is for the lack of direct incorporation of the phrasing from the provided answer, but overall, this is an excellent and thorough response."
