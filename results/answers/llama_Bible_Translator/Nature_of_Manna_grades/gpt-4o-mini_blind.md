## [Answer](../Nature_of_Manna.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Exodus 16:31, when Moses asked God for instructions on how to preserve the manna (the miraculous bread provided by God during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness), God replied that they should gather it every morning. The text states:

"He said to them, 'This is what the Lord has commanded: Gather as much of it as each person can eat and store for yourselves; you will need a sixth part of an ephah a day."'

As for its appearance and taste, Exodus 16:31-32 describes manna as "fine, flaky stuff, like dew on the ground." It also says that it was sweet and had the appearance of coriander seed.

Additionally, Numbers 11:7-8 provides more information about the appearance of manna. When Moses complained to God about the people's request for meat instead of bread, God responded by sending quail and providing an abundance of manna. The text states:

"And when the dew set in, behold, on the surface of the wilderness a fine, scale-like thing had formed, fine as frost on the ground."

So, based on these passages, we can infer that manna was a sweet-tasting, flaky or scale-like substance with the appearance of coriander seed and dew on the ground.
