  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-supported answer referencing relevant Bible passages from Exodus and Numbers to describe the appearance and taste of manna. They accurately described manna as sweet-tasting and likened its appearance to dew on the ground and coriander seed, which aligns with biblical accounts. However, the reference answer from the teacher slightly simplifies and clarifies the description as white flakes tasting sweet like honey, which could have been explicitly mentioned by the student for a more precise response."
