The miracles performed by Jesus in the New Testament are significant revelations of His identity and nature. In fact, they serve as evidence of His divinity and humanity, highlighting His unique role as the Son of God.

Here are some key things that the miracles reveal about Jesus' identity:

1. **Divine Power**: The miracles demonstrate Jesus' unparalleled power and authority over creation. His ability to heal the sick, raise the dead, and control nature (e.g., calming a storm) showcases His divine origin and connection to God.
2. **Messiahship**: The miracles fulfill Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's ministry. For example, Jesus' healing of the blind and lame (Isa. 35:5-6) and His feeding of the multitudes (Ex. 16:4-18) mirror the Messianic expectations found in the Hebrew Scriptures.
3. **Savior**: The miracles reveal Jesus as a Savior who comes to rescue humanity from sin, sickness, and spiritual death. His healing of lepers (Luke 17:11-19), for instance, illustrates His ability to cleanse people from their moral impurities and restore them to a right relationship with God.
4. **Tension between Human and Divine**: The miracles also highlight the tension between Jesus' humanity and divinity. His emotions, fatigue, and human limitations are juxtaposed with His divine power and authority. This tension underscores the mysterious nature of Jesus' person and mission.
5. **Pointing to Spiritual Reality**: While the miracles were physical manifestations, they often served as signs pointing to spiritual realities. For example, Jesus' feeding of the 4,000 (Matt. 15:32-39) was not just a physical provision but also a symbol of His ability to satisfy spiritual hunger and thirst.
6. **Revelation of God's Love**: The miracles consistently demonstrate God's love and care for humanity. Jesus' compassion, mercy, and willingness to heal and help the marginalized and oppressed showcase His character as one who embodies God's loving nature (John 3:16).
7. **Witness to His Message**: The miracles were not merely impressive displays of power but also served as a validation of Jesus' teachings and message. They authenticated His words about God's love, forgiveness, and redemption, inviting people to put their faith in Him.

In summary, the miracles performed by Jesus reveal His divinity, Messiahship, saviorhood, humanity, and spiritual nature. They highlight His power, authority, compassion, and willingness to help the marginalized, while pointing to spiritual realities and underscoring God's love for humanity.
