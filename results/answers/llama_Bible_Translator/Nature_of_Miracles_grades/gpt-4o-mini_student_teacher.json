  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful analysis of the miracles performed by Jesus and their significance in revealing His identity. They have effectively highlighted various aspects such as Jesus' divine power, Messiahship, saviorhood, tension between human and divine nature, pointing to spiritual realities, revelation of God's love, and authentication of His message. However, the student could have focused more on the direct and concise statement from the reference answer that the miracles reveal Jesus is God and the Christ. Emphasizing this central point more prominently would have strengthened their response."
