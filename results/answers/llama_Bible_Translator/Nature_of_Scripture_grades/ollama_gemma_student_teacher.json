  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 90\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the relationship between Scripture and the Word of God in the biblical context. They clearly articulate the distinction between the written revelation and God's spoken word throughout history, including the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate manifestation of the Word of God. The student's understanding of the trinitarian connection between Scripture, the Word incarnate, and the ultimate Word of God is commendable."
