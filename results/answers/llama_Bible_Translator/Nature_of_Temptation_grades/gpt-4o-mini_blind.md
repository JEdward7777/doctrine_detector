## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I can attest that the Scriptures provide insight into the roles of our sinful nature and external influences in temptation.

Firstly, regarding our sinful nature, Jesus teaches us that "the flesh is weak" (Matthew 26:41) and that we are all born with a natural inclination to sin (Ephesians 2:1-3). This sinful tendency within us can be the catalyst for temptation. Our fallen human nature has a propensity to pursue our own desires, interests, and ambitions, often at the expense of obeying God's will. In this sense, our sinful nature is an internal source of temptation.

Secondly, external influences also play a significant role in tempting us away from God's way. The world (1 John 2:15-17) and Satan (Matthew 4:3; Luke 22:31), as the ultimate tempter (John 8:44), can use various means to entice us into sin. This may include peer pressure, social media, tempting situations, or even our own emotions and desires.

In 1 Corinthians 10:13, Paul reminds us that God is faithful and will not allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear. However, He does allow external temptations as a testing ground for our faith (James 1:2-4). This means that while our sinful nature and external influences are real sources of temptation, they are also opportunities for us to choose obedience over disobedience and trust in God's sovereignty.

Ultimately, the Bible teaches that we have the power to resist temptation through prayer, reliance on the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:16-17), and submission to God's will (Romans 6:12-14). As believers, it is crucial to recognize both our internal sinful nature and external influences as potential temptations, while relying on Christ's help and guidance to navigate these challenges.
