  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that aligns with Christian teachings on the roles of sinful nature and external influences in temptation. They have effectively referenced relevant Bible verses and explained how both internal and external factors contribute to temptation. However, the grade is slightly lower as there is some unnecessary elaboration and repetition in the response, which could have been more concise. Additionally, the response could have directly linked back to the teacher's reference answer for a clearer comparison. Overall, a strong understanding of the topic is demonstrated in the student's answer."
