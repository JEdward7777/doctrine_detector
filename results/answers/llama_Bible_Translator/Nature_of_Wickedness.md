## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible describes individuals as "wicked" when they consistently act against God's will, ignore His commands, and reject His love. In various contexts, the Scriptures portray wickedness as a deliberate choice to disobey God and follow one's own sinful desires. Here are some ways the Bible suggests individuals can be "wicked" in their actions:

1. Ignoring God's laws (Romans 1:18-32): The Bible says that when people refuse to acknowledge God's existence, He gives them over to a debased mind and they become wicked. This is evident in the way they engage in vile and depraved behavior.
2. Pursuing evil desires (Galatians 5:19-21; Ephesians 4:17-19): The Bible warns that those who indulge in sin will become slaves to their sinful nature, leading them down a path of wickedness. This can manifest in various forms, such as immorality, idolatry, hatred, and strife.
3. Refusing God's guidance (Deuteronomy 28:15-68; Jeremiah 11:10): When people reject God's words and His guidance, they are said to be wicked. This is evident in their stubborn refusal to listen to Him and their desire to do things their own way.
4. Engaging in idolatry (Exodus 20:3-5; Deuteronomy 6:14-15): Idolatry is a form of wickedness, as it involves worshipping created things rather than the Creator. This can manifest in various forms, such as idolizing wealth, status, or power.
5. Oppressing others (Proverbs 10:3; Isaiah 1:17): The Bible says that those who oppress the poor, the widow, and the orphan are wicked. This is evident in their refusal to show compassion and love to those in need.

Regarding the state of such individuals, the Bible has the following to say:

1. They are separated from God (Isaiah 59:2; Ephesians 2:1-3): Those who are wicked are said to be far from God's presence. This separation is a result of their sin and rebellion against Him.
2. They are under His judgment (Romans 6:23; Hebrews 9:27): The Bible warns that those who continue in wickedness will face God's judgment, which results in eternal destruction (Matthew 25:31-46).
3. They can experience spiritual blindness (2 Corinthians 4:4; Ephesians 4:17-19): Wicked individuals are said to be spiritually blind, unable to see the truth and the consequences of their actions.
4. They need God's mercy and redemption (John 3:16-17; Romans 5:8-11): The Bible offers hope for those who are wicked through the message of salvation. Those who turn to God and repent of their sins can experience forgiveness, cleansing, and a new life in Him.

Ultimately, the Bible presents a clear distinction between good and evil, right and wrong, and encourages believers to seek after God's will and character.
