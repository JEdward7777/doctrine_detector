  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the concepts of \"soul\" and \"spirit\" in the Bible, demonstrating a good understanding of the distinctions between the two. The student effectively uses biblical references to support their explanations. However, the answer could be improved by acknowledging the potential interchangeability of these terms in the Bible, as highlighted in the reference answer. Emphasizing this aspect would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the topic."
