## [Answer](../Nazirite_Vow_Significance.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Nazirite vow, described in Numbers 6:1-4, imposes several key restrictions on those who take it:

1. Abstain from wine and strong drink (Numbers 6:3): A Nazirite must avoid consuming any fermented beverage, including wine, beer, and other intoxicating drinks.
2. Avoid any grape product or residue (Numbers 6:3-4): This includes grapes, raisins, grape juice, and even the fruit's residue on one's skin or clothes. Any contact with grapes or their products would render a Nazirite unclean.
3. Refrain from cutting hair (Numbers 6:5): As part of the vow, a Nazirite is not allowed to cut or shave their hair, either by cutting it close to the head or leaving it long.

These restrictions are intended to separate the Nazirite from worldly temptations and focus them on their spiritual commitment.
