It effectively highlights the universal access to God, spiritual empowerment, forgiveness of sins, indwelling of God, and the concept of becoming a new creation through the new covenant. The reference to Jesus' sacrifice completely atoning for people's sins forever aligns well with the Christian worldview of redemption and salvation through Christ."
