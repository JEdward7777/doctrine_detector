It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how Jesus' sacrifice completely atoned for people's sins forever, fulfilling God's promises of a new covenant. The aspects of universal access to God, spiritual empowerment, forgiveness of sins, indwelling of God, and new creation are discussed in relation to this central theme, presenting a comprehensive understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job in integrating the significance of Jesus' sacrifice within the broader context of God's promises and the transformative impact of the new covenant."
