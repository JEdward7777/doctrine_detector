  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This answer provides a thoughtful analysis of the New Testament's interaction with the Psalms, highlighting the importance of the Psalter in the teachings of Jesus and the apostles. The student effectively connects specific scriptural references to demonstrate the influence of Psalms on Christian thought and practice. However, to improve the response, the student could have emphasized the role of the Psalms in foreshadowing and pointing to Christ more explicitly, as well as mentioning the Psalms' continued relevance for believers in terms of prayer, worship, and encouragement."
