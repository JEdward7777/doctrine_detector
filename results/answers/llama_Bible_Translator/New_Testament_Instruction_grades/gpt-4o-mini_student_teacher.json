  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful response, showing a strong understanding of the connection between the Psalms and New Testament teachings. They effectively demonstrated how the Psalms are integrated into the teachings and practices of Jesus Christ and the apostles, highlighting their importance in Christian worship. However, the student did not directly address the concern of how biblical teachings on Psalms apply to contemporary Christian worship as specified in the question, which is why a slightly lower grade is given."
