The response clearly articulates the absence of explicit instructions regarding the application of the Psalms in the New Testament but suggests various ways in which they can be understood and utilized. The inclusion of relevant textual examples from the Gospels and Paul's Epistles strengthens the argument. The conclusion appropriately highlights the significance of the Psalms for understanding Jesus Christ and Christian practices."
