While it correctly notes that Jesus and the apostles quoted from the Psalms and alluded to Psalmic passages in their teachings, it does not explicitly show how these teachings apply to modern-day worship practices.\n\nThe response could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples or practical applications of Psalmic teachings in contemporary Christian worship, such as using Psalmic prayers in corporate worship services or incorporating Psalm-inspired music into one's personal devotions. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer connection between the biblical teachings and the concern of identifying how they apply to modern-day worship practices.\n\nOverall, while the response demonstrates some understanding of the role of the Psalms in Christian worship, it could be improved by providing more explicit connections to contemporary worship practices."
