  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85.\n\nWhile the student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament and includes relevant biblical references, there is some unnecessary repetition and elaboration that could have been condensed for clarity and conciseness. Additionally, the student could have focused more directly on addressing the concern of understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers without including extraneous information. However, overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and effectively communicated how every believer in Jesus is considered a priest."
