  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 95/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is an exceptional response that comprehensively explains the concept of the priesthood of all believers from a Christian perspective. The student clearly articulates the idea that every believer is empowered as a priest with direct access to God, the responsibility to offer worship and sacrifice, and the privilege of intercessory prayer. The student's understanding of the priestly ministry of Christ and its implications for believers is insightful and well-articulated."
