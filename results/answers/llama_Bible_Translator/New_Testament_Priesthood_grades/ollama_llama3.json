  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nThis response accurately conveys the concept of the priesthood of all believers, emphasizing that every believer in Jesus has direct access to God and can intercede for themselves and others. The supporting biblical references and explanations provide a clear understanding of this role.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the lack of explicit mention of the redefinition of this priestly ministry from Old Testament Israel to the New Testament church, as mentioned in the original response. However, the overall summary effectively captures the essence of being a priest in the New Testament context.\n\nWell-done!"
