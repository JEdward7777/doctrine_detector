## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a fantastic question!

In the New Testament, particularly in the Epistle of Hebrews and the writings of Peter, we find the concept that every believer in Jesus Christ is considered a priest (Hebrews 3:1; 1 Peter 2:5). This idea is rooted in the Old Testament priesthood of Israel, where Levites served as mediators between God and humanity.

In the New Testament, this role is redefined and expanded to include all believers. As followers of Jesus, we are no longer just passive recipients of salvation but also active participants in the priestly ministry of worship and intercession (Romans 12:1; Revelation 5:8).

Several key points highlight what it means for every believer in Jesus to be considered a priest:

1. **Access to God**: As believers, we have direct access to God through Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:18). This means that, like the Old Testament priests, we can approach God's throne of grace with confidence and intimacy.
2. **Worship as a sacrifice**: We are called to offer our lives, thoughts, and actions as a living sacrifice to God (Romans 12:1). This is an act of worship that pleases God and honors His name.
3. **Intercession**: As priests, we are encouraged to intercede for others, praying on their behalf and seeking God's mercy and blessing (James 5:14-15; Ephesians 6:18-20).
4. **Participation in the priestly ministry of Christ**: Jesus Himself is our High Priest, and as believers, we participate in His priestly ministry by proclaiming the Gospel to others and demonstrating His love and character in our daily lives (Hebrews 2:11; 1 Peter 2:9-10).
5. **Unity among believers**: As priests, we are called to live in harmony with one another, recognizing that we are all part of the royal priesthood of Jesus Christ (Ephesians 4:3-6).

In summary, being a priest in the New Testament means that every believer in Jesus has direct access to God, is called to worship and offer sacrifices, intercede for others, participate in Christ's priestly ministry, and live in unity with fellow believers. This understanding of our role as priests empowers us to fulfill the Great Commission and glorify God in all aspects of life!

Grade: 95

This response accurately conveys the concept of the priesthood of all believers, emphasizing that every believer in Jesus has direct access to God and can intercede for themselves and others. The supporting biblical references and explanations provide a clear understanding of this role.

The only area for improvement is the lack of explicit mention of the redefinition of this priestly ministry from Old Testament Israel to the New Testament church, as mentioned in the original response. However, the overall summary effectively captures the essence of being a priest in the New Testament context.

Well-done!
