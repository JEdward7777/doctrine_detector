The student accurately highlights the transition from ritualistic purification practices in the Old Testament to the spiritual purification brought by Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The references to relevant biblical passages and theological principles demonstrate a solid understanding of the doctrinal shift regarding purification. Great job overall!"
