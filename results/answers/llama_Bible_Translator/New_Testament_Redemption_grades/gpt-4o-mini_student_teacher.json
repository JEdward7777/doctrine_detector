  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured answer comparing purification concepts in the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the shift from ritualistic purification in the Old Testament to the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification in the New Testament. The answer effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus as the ultimate purifier and the forgiveness of sins through faith in Him. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to directly mention the aspect of repentance in the student's answer, as it is a key component of the reference answer provided by the teacher."
