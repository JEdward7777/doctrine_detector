  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of recognizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin. The author provides a clear explanation of how Jesus' atoning sacrifice and resurrection mark a significant shift in the concept of purification, and how it supplants traditional ritual purifications. The emphasis on internal holiness through faith in Jesus Christ is also well-articulated.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more explicit connections between the Old Testament concepts of purification and the New Testament reality of being permanently cleansed from sin through faith in Jesus. While the response does a good job of highlighting the differences between the two testaments, it could benefit from a more direct explanation of how Christ's sacrifice is the means by which believers are permanently purified.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that effectively communicates the concept of purification and its connection to the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice."
