  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and thoughtful analysis of the potential connections between John the Baptist and the Nazirites in the New Testament. They presented multiple relevant points and made insightful comparisons. However, they missed referencing the specific evidence from the teacher's answer, which directly linked John's behavior to the Nazirite vow. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of biblical continuity between the Old and New Testaments."
