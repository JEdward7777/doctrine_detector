The student effectively conveys the primary purpose of the ark as a means of saving a remnant of humanity and the animals from God's judgment through the flood. The response is well-supported with references to specific verses in Genesis and details about the construction and events surrounding the ark. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound explanation. Great job!"
