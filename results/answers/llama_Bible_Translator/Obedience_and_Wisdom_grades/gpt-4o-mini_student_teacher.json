  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful exploration of how listening to God connects to becoming wise, incorporating biblical references and discussing key aspects of developing wisdom in a Christian context. However, the student's answer could have more explicitly emphasized the direct link between obedience to God and wisdom, as highlighted in the reference answer. Strengthening this connection would have further enhanced the depth of the response."
