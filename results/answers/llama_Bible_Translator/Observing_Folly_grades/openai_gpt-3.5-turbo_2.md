## [Answer](../Observing_Folly.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In Scripture, foolishness (or folly) refers to behaviors and attitudes that contradict God's wisdom and are ultimately detrimental to one's spiritual well-being and relationships with others. Here are some examples of actions categorized as folly in the Bible:

1. Idolatry: Worshiping false gods or idols instead of the one true God (Deuteronomy 4:28-30, Isaiah 44:15-20).
2. Rebellion against authority: Disobeying God's commands, neglecting parental guidance, or resisting spiritual leaders (Deuteronomy 17:11-13, Hebrews 13:7-8).
3. Pride and arrogance: Elevating oneself above others, thinking one is better than everyone else, or having an inflated sense of self-importance (Proverbs 16:18, James 4:6-10).
4. Lack of wisdom: Ignoring God's Word, ignoring good counsel, or making decisions without seeking guidance from the Lord (Proverbs 1:7, 9:10).
5. Unforgiveness: Holding grudges and refusing to release others from past offenses, which can lead to spiritual stagnation and even sin (Matthew 6:15, Ephesians 4:32).
6. Gluttony and excess: Overindulging in food, drink, or other pleasures to the point of neglecting one's responsibilities or harming oneself and others (Deuteronomy 14:26-27, Luke 12:20).
7. Anger management issues: Allowing anger to control one's actions, leading to sin and harm towards others (James 1:19-21, Ephesians 4:26-27).
8. Fornication and sexual immorality: Engaging in sexual activities outside of God's ordained boundaries, such as premarital sex, adultery, or same-sex relationships (Hebrews 13:4, 1 Corinthians 6:18-20).
9. Envy and jealousy: Coveting what belongs to others, being discontent with one's own life, or resenting the blessings of others (Galatians 5:26, James 3:14-16).
10. Lack of gratitude: Neglecting to thank God for His blessings, provisions, and mercies, and instead focusing on one's own accomplishments or possessions (1 Thessalonians 5:18, Hebrews 13:5).

These examples illustrate the various forms of folly that Scripture condemns, emphasizing the importance of seeking wisdom from above and living in obedience to God's Word.
