The connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest is appropriately emphasized. The answer could be enhanced by including specific references to the instructions given in Leviticus 8-9 for carrying out the priests' consecration and initial ministry duties. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a good understanding of the topic."
