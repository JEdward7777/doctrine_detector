  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how the priests carried out their ministry in the temple in the Old Testament. They covered various aspects such as offerings, burning incense, cleansing rituals, bread and wine, intercession, and ritual purity, showing a solid understanding of the practices involved. The student also connected these practices to their significance in maintaining a connection with God and highlighted the foreshadowing of Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest.\n\nHowever, while the student's response was thorough and insightful, it was quite lengthy and could have been more concise. The answer could have been improved by focusing on summarizing the key points more effectively. Nonetheless, the depth of understanding displayed by the student deserves commendation, hence the high grade."
