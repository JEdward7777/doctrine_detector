The inclusion of specific references to biblical passages enhances the clarity and depth of the discussion. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how understanding the practices of the Old Testament priests can inform current ministry approaches and deepen our understanding of sacrificial service. The incorporation of Christian theology, such as the foreshadowing of Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest, further strengthens the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
