The writer effectively connects the practices of the Old Testament priesthood to the broader theme of sacrificial service and the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ. The response is well-written and demonstrates a deep understanding of how the Old Testament practices can inform current ministry approaches. Great job!"
