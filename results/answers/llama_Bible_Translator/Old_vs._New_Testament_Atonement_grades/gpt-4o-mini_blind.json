The student effectively highlights key points such as the shift from temporary to permanent atonement, the role of Jesus as the ultimate substitute, and the transition from the Mosaic Covenant to the New Covenant. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references enhances the theological depth of the answer. Well done!"
