  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized comparison between the Old Testament and New Testament understandings of atonement, demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic. The response effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The inclusion of key differences and supporting biblical references enhances the overall quality of the answer. The only minor deduction is due to the student's answer being more detailed than the reference answer, but it aligns well with a Christian worldview perspective."
