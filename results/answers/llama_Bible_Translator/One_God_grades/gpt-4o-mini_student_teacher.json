  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response on emphasizing the concept of 'One God' in translations for cultures with multiple deities. They made excellent points on using clear language, highlighting God's unity, contrasting with other gods, emphasizing sovereignty, using metaphors, and highlighting God's self-revelation. However, the student did not directly address the concept of the Trinity in emphasizing monotheism, as recommended in the reference answer from the teacher. Incorporating the unique nature of God as Trinity would further enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
