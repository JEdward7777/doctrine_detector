  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer that delves into the historical and religious significance of the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) before the events in the New Testament. They accurately covered the festival's origins, traditions, and connections to the harvest, Torah revelation, and Exodus story. The student effectively tied in the Jewish perspectives and also made a good attempt to connect the festival to the fulfillment in Christ by mentioning the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost in the New Testament. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on how Pentecost was fulfilled in Christ to better address the concern provided, which is connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ."
