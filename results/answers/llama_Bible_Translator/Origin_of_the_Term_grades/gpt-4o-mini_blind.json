The inclusion of relevant Bible passages and historical context adds depth to the answer. However, the explanation could be enhanced by emphasizing that the term \"Christian\" means \"follower of Christ,\" highlighting the significance of identifying with Jesus Christ. Additionally, connecting the use of the term \"Christian\" to believers' acknowledgment of following Christ's teachings and example would further strengthen the doctrinal perspective."
