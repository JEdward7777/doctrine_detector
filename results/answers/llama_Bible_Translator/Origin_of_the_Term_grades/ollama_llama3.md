## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the New Testament, the name "Christian" was first used by non-Christian outsiders, not by Jesus' followers themselves. The term "Christian" appears in three passages: Acts 11:26, Acts 26:28, and 1 Peter 4:16.

In Acts 11:26, we read that "the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch." This phrase is often interpreted to mean that the name "Christian" was first used by non-Christian outsiders (likely Jewish critics or Gentile pagans) to refer to Jesus' followers in the city of Antioch, around 40-42 AD.

In Acts 26:28, King Agrippa II says to Paul, "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." Here again, it is likely that the term was being used by non-Christian outsiders to refer to Jesus' followers.

Finally, in 1 Peter 4:16, Peter writes to his audience, "But if anyone suffers as a martyr, let him not be ashamed but account it glorious in witnessing concerning Christ. If anyone speaks, speaking truth; and if anyone judges, judging justly." The phrase "Christians the only ones" is sometimes added to this verse, although some manuscripts do not include it.

While these passages do not provide a precise answer to when Jesus' followers started calling themselves "Christian," they suggest that the term was initially used by outsiders to refer to Jesus' followers, and later adopted by believers as a badge of honor.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides some accurate information about the origins of the term "Christian" in the New Testament, citing three passages that mention the term. However, it oversimplifies the historical context and significance of the term by suggesting that Jesus' followers started calling themselves "Christians" only after outsiders used the term first. While this may be a possible interpretation of Acts 11:26, the response does not fully account for the complexity of the issue.

A more nuanced understanding of the historical context would recognize that the term "Christian" was likely used by both insiders and outsiders, with different connotations and implications. The response could have benefited from a deeper exploration of how the term was perceived and employed by early Christians, as well as its significance in the larger narrative of Acts and 1 Peter.

Overall, while the response demonstrates some understanding of the relevant biblical passages, it falls short of fully addressing the concern about recognizing historical context and significance.
