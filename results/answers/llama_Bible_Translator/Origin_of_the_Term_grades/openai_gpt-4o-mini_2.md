## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the New Testament, the name "Christian" was first used by non-Christian outsiders, not by Jesus' followers themselves. The term "Christian" appears in three passages: Acts 11:26, Acts 26:28, and 1 Peter 4:16.

In Acts 11:26, we read that "the disciples were called Christians first at Antioch." This phrase is often interpreted to mean that the name "Christian" was first used by non-Christian outsiders (likely Jewish critics or Gentile pagans) to refer to Jesus' followers in the city of Antioch, around 40-42 AD.

In Acts 26:28, King Agrippa II says to Paul, "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." Here again, it is likely that the term was being used by non-Christian outsiders to refer to Jesus' followers.

Finally, in 1 Peter 4:16, Peter writes to his audience, "But if anyone suffers as a martyr, let him not be ashamed but account it glorious in witnessing concerning Christ. If anyone speaks, speaking truth; and if anyone judges, judging justly." The phrase "Christians the only ones" is sometimes added to this verse, although some manuscripts do not include it.

While these passages do not provide a precise answer to when Jesus' followers started calling themselves "Christian," they suggest that the term was initially used by outsiders to refer to Jesus' followers, and later adopted by believers as a badge of honor.
