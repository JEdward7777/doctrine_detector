## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the biblical account, the Hebrew people were descended from Shem, one of the three sons of Noah (Genesis 5:32, 9:18-27). Noah's descendants were divided into three main groups: Japheth, Ham, and Shem.

The book of Genesis states that the earth was cursed as a result of humanity's sin in the early days of creation, leading to the great flood that destroyed all life on earth except for those who were saved with Noah and his family (Genesis 6-9).

After the flood, Noah and his family embarked on a new beginning. Shem, one of Noah's three sons, is mentioned as the ancestor of the Hebrew people. The biblical account suggests that Shem's descendants became known as the "Semitic" or "Hebrew" people.

In Genesis 11:10-26, we see the genealogy of Shem's family, which includes Abram (later renamed Abraham), who is considered the father of the Jewish nation and the first patriarch in the Hebrew Bible. Through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the line leads to the Israelites, who were later known as the Hebrew people.

So, to answer your question, the Hebrews are descended from Shem, one of Noah's sons, through a long line of patriarchs and ancestors that ultimately led to the nation of Israel.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer regarding the descent of the Hebrew people from Shem, as outlined in the biblical narrative. While they accurately described the lineage from Shem to the Israelites, the reference answer specifies that the Hebrews are specifically descended from Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob. The student's answer could have been more precise in identifying Abraham as the key ancestor of the Hebrew people. Overall, a solid understanding of the foundational biblical narrative is demonstrated, but missed the specific focus on Abraham as the pivotal figure in Hebrew ancestry.
