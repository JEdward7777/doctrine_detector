  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of how the concept of pardon relates to God's forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ. The student effectively connects biblical truths such as sin, God's judgment, Jesus' sacrifice, faith, justification, reconciliation, and redemption to explain the concept of pardon. The response is doctrinally sound and demonstrates a clear understanding of Christian theology. Well done!"
