  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and rich explanation of the concept of pardon in relation to God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ, incorporating relevant biblical references and theological concepts. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern of exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness, which was not explicitly addressed in the response. Nonetheless, the student's understanding and articulation of the topic were commendable."
