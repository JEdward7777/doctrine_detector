They effectively connect Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection with the symbolism of the Passover lamb and the redemption of humanity from sin. The use of biblical references enhances the explanation and demonstrates a solid understanding of the doctrinal implications. The student accurately distinguishes between adopting Jewish customs and the core Christian beliefs associated with Passover. Overall, a strong and well-supported response."
