## [Answer](../Passover_Significance.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I'd like to shed light on the significance of Passover in relation to Jesus.

In the New Testament, Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection are deeply connected to the Jewish festival of Passover. As described in John 18:28-32, Jesus was arrested and brought before Pontius Pilate during the evening hours of Nisan 14, which is the day before Passover. This timing is crucial, as it marks the beginning of Passover.

In a sense, Jesus' crucifixion can be seen as a fulfillment of the Passover sacrifice. In Exodus 12:1-30, God instructed the Israelites to slaughter and eat the Passover lamb, symbolizing their freedom from slavery in Egypt. Jesus, being the Lamb of God (John 1:29), became the ultimate Passover sacrifice. His death on the cross represents the redemption of humanity from sin, just as the original Passover lamb signified the redemption of Israel from physical slavery.

Furthermore, Jesus' resurrection on the third day (Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-12) is often seen as a fulfillment of the symbolism surrounding the Paschal Lamb. In Numbers 9:15, God commanded the Israelites to observe Passover for seven days, with the final celebration on the seventh day. Jesus' resurrection can be viewed as the ultimate "eighth day" of Passover, where He rises from the dead, just as the Paschal Lamb was spared and allowed to live.

In this sense, Christians celebrate Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection during Holy Week, which includes Good Friday (the commemoration of His death) and Easter Sunday (the celebration of His resurrection). This period is often seen as a time of remembrance and reflection on the significance of Passover in relation to Jesus Christ.

It's worth noting that while Christians have adopted many Jewish customs and traditions related to Passover, such as eating matzo or holding Seder meals during Holy Week, these practices are not meant to be observed as part of Christian worship. Rather, they serve as a reminder of the deep connections between Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, and the rich theological heritage of the Old Testament.
