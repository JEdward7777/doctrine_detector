According to Scripture, faith in Jesus' sacrifice plays a crucial role in achieving peace with God.

In Romans 5:1-2, it is written, "Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand." Here, the apostle Paul emphasizes that justification (being declared righteous) comes through faith in Jesus' sacrifice. This justification is what allows us to have "peace with God."

In Ephesians 2:13-18, Paul explains that Jesus' sacrifice has broken down the dividing wall between humanity and God, making it possible for us to approach Him through faith. He writes, "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have become near by the blood of Christ." This blood sacrifice is what reconciles us to God (Ephesians 5:2), and our response to this reconciliation is faith.

In Hebrews 10:14-18, the author of Hebrews highlights the power of Jesus' sacrifice, saying that it has obtained eternal redemption for us. He writes, "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God." Here, the author emphasizes that faith in this sacrifice is what leads us into a right relationship with God.

In 1 Peter 3:18, Peter writes, "For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit." Here, Peter emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice as the means by which we are brought into a right relationship with God.

In all these passages, Scripture is clear: faith in Jesus' sacrifice is essential for achieving peace with God. It is through this sacrifice that our sins are forgiven (Romans 5:9), and it is through this sacrifice that we have access to God's grace (Ephesians 2:18). Ultimately, it is only by trusting in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ that we can experience true peace with God.

So, according to Scripture, faith in Jesus' sacrifice plays a crucial role in achieving peace with God.
