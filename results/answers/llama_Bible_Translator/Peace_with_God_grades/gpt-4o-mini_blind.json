The references to Romans, Ephesians, Hebrews, and 1 Peter are well-explained and demonstrate a clear understanding of the doctrinal importance of Jesus' sacrifice in the Christian faith. The student effectively connects these passages to emphasize the central role of faith in Jesus' sacrifice for reconciliation with God. Great job!"
