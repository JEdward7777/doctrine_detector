The explanation effectively ties in biblical truth and offers a Christian perspective on the topic. The response highlights the Pharisees' misunderstanding of Jesus' teachings and the conflicts that arose due to their rigid focus on the external aspects of the law. The role of the Pharisees in Jesus' ministry is clearly elucidated, providing valuable insight into the challenges faced by Jesus. The only minor improvement could be further emphasizing how Jesus' teachings contrasted with the Pharisees' approach to the law."
