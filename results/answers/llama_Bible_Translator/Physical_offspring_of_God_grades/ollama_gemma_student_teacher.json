  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 95/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical and theological context of the term \"Son of God.\" They effectively address the concern about physical offspring by clarifying that Jesus is not considered the biological son of God but rather the divine Son who became human through the Incarnation. The analogies and illustrations used to explain the concept are clear and helpful. The response is well-written and comprehensive, providing a thorough clarification of the term for someone who believes it implies physical offspring."
