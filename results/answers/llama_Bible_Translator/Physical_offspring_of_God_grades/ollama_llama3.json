  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response provides a thorough and accurate clarification of the term \"Son of God\" in a Christian context. It effectively addresses potential misunderstandings by highlighting the biblical usage, contextual understanding, Jesus' unique nature, and theological framework surrounding this phrase. The response also offers practical advice on how to clarify the concept for others who may be misunderstanding it.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in its presentation. While the information provided is excellent, some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make the text difficult to follow. Additionally, the use of multiple supporting scriptures throughout the response would strengthen its biblical foundation.\n\nOverall, this response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"Son of God\" and is well-suited for addressing the concern about proper teaching preventing doctrinal errors."
