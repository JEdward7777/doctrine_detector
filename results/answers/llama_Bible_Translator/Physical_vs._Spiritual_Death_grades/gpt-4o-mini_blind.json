  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation differentiating between physical death and the spiritual meaning of \"perish\" in biblical context. It is doctrinally sound and effectively uses scriptural references to support the points made. The answer could be further enhanced by including additional Old Testament references for the concept of \"perishing\" and perhaps addressing the aspect of resurrection in the Christian worldview to provide a more holistic view on the topic. Overall, a solid and insightful response."
