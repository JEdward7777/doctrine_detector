## Question [Physical vs. Spiritual Death](../../../questions/Physical_vs._Spiritual_Death.md)
How should we differentiate between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish'?

While everyone will die physically, 'perish' in a spiritual context highlights eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus, and should be expressed as such in translation.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding.

## [Answer](../Physical_vs._Spiritual_Death.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In the Bible, the word "perish" (Greek: ἀπολλύω, apollyō) can have different connotations depending on the context. When Jesus says that those who do not believe will "perish" (John 3:16), He is speaking spiritually.

To distinguish between physical death and the spiritual meaning of "perish," let's consider a few key points:

1. Spiritual judgment: In many cases, when Scripture says someone will "perish," it means they will be separated from God and face eternal judgment (e.g., Matthew 10:28; Revelation 20:15). This is not referring to physical death, but rather the spiritual consequences of rejecting Jesus.
2. Eternal destruction: When Jesus warns that those who reject Him will "perish" in hell (Matthew 25:46), He's speaking about eternal separation from God and the subsequent destruction of their souls. This is not a reference to physical annihilation, but rather eternal torment.
3. Loss of salvation: In some cases, "perishing" might mean losing one's opportunity for salvation or experiencing spiritual death due to sin (Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:1-5). This too is a spiritual reality, not physical death.

On the other hand, when Scripture speaks of physical death, it typically uses different terms and phrases. For example:

* "Die" (Greek: θνησείς, thaneis) or "be dead" (Greek: νεκρός, nekros)
* "Pass away" (Greek: ἀφίημι, aphieimi; Hebrew: מָת, mâth)
* "Cease to be" (Hebrew: יִגְוַע, yiqwa‘)

In these cases, the focus is on the end of one's physical life, not spiritual judgment or separation from God.

To summarize:

* When Scripture says someone will "perish," it often refers to spiritual judgment, eternal destruction, or loss of salvation, rather than physical death.
* Use context and vocabulary differences to distinguish between physical death and the spiritual meaning of "perish."

May this help clarify the nuances in your study of God's Word!

95.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

This response thoroughly addresses the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death, providing several examples from Scripture to support its claims. The discussion is clear and concise, making it easy for readers to follow along and understand the nuances of the word "perish" in different contexts.

The only area for improvement would be to more explicitly state how this understanding affects one's understanding of salvation or eternal consequences. While the response does touch on this, it could be further developed to provide a more comprehensive treatment of the topic.

Comment: This response provides an excellent explanation of the biblical concept of "perish" and its different connotations depending on the context. The examples from Scripture are well-chosen and help to drive home the point that "perish" often refers to spiritual judgment, eternal destruction, or loss of salvation rather than physical death. With a bit more attention to the implications for understanding salvation, this response could be considered virtually flawless.
