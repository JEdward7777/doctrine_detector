## [Answer](../Physical_vs._Spiritual_Death.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In the Bible, the word "perish" (Greek: ἀπολλύω, apollyō) can have different connotations depending on the context. When Jesus says that those who do not believe will "perish" (John 3:16), He is speaking spiritually.

To distinguish between physical death and the spiritual meaning of "perish," let's consider a few key points:

1. Spiritual judgment: In many cases, when Scripture says someone will "perish," it means they will be separated from God and face eternal judgment (e.g., Matthew 10:28; Revelation 20:15). This is not referring to physical death, but rather the spiritual consequences of rejecting Jesus.
2. Eternal destruction: When Jesus warns that those who reject Him will "perish" in hell (Matthew 25:46), He's speaking about eternal separation from God and the subsequent destruction of their souls. This is not a reference to physical annihilation, but rather eternal torment.
3. Loss of salvation: In some cases, "perishing" might mean losing one's opportunity for salvation or experiencing spiritual death due to sin (Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:1-5). This too is a spiritual reality, not physical death.

On the other hand, when Scripture speaks of physical death, it typically uses different terms and phrases. For example:

* "Die" (Greek: θνησείς, thaneis) or "be dead" (Greek: νεκρός, nekros)
* "Pass away" (Greek: ἀφίημι, aphieimi; Hebrew: מָת, mâth)
* "Cease to be" (Hebrew: יִגְוַע, yiqwa‘)

In these cases, the focus is on the end of one's physical life, not spiritual judgment or separation from God.

To summarize:

* When Scripture says someone will "perish," it often refers to spiritual judgment, eternal destruction, or loss of salvation, rather than physical death.
* Use context and vocabulary differences to distinguish between physical death and the spiritual meaning of "perish."

May this help clarify the nuances in your study of God's Word!

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the distinction between physical and spiritual death in relation to the term "perish" in a Biblical context. It effectively addresses the concern raised by emphasizing the eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus. The incorporation of relevant scriptural references and linguistic analysis enhances the clarity and depth of the explanation. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of understanding the spiritual implications of "perish." The only minor improvement could be adding a brief theological reflection on the significance of trusting in Jesus for salvation.
