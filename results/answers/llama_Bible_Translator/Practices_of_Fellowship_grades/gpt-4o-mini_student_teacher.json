  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of how early Christians expressed their fellowship, touching on various important aspects such as shared meals, house churches, prayer and worship, resource sharing, and mutual support. The student effectively references Biblical passages to support their points and demonstrates a clear understanding of the practices of fellowship among early Christians. However, the answer could be improved by directly aligning with the reference answer in terms of simplicity and conciseness."
