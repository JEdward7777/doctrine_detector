What a great question! In the early Christian era, fellowship was a vital aspect of community life. As the apostles and disciples of Jesus Christ followed His teachings and commands (e.g., John 13:34-35; Philippians 2:1-4), they expressed their fellowship in several ways:

1. **Breaking Bread**: One primary means of expressing fellowship was through sharing meals together, often referred to as "breaking bread." This act symbolized unity, love, and shared life (Acts 2:42-47). Meals served as a natural setting for worship, prayer, teaching, and mutual support.
2. **House Churches**: As Christianity spread throughout the Mediterranean world, believers gathered in private homes or rented spaces to form small communities. These "house churches" provided an intimate setting for fellowship, worship, and ministry (Romans 16:3-5; Colossians 4:15).
3. **Prayer and Worship**: Early Christians frequently came together to pray, sing praises, and give thanks to God. This collective expression of devotion fostered unity and a sense of belonging among believers (Acts 2:42-47; Ephesians 5:18-20).
4. **Sharing Resources**: In a culture where poverty was prevalent, early Christians demonstrated their commitment to one another by sharing what they had (Acts 4:32-37). This practice reflected Jesus' teaching on the importance of loving and serving one another (John 13:34-35).
5. **Mutual Support**: As believers faced various challenges, they supported each other through prayer, encouragement, and practical help (Philippians 1:3-6; Hebrews 10:23-25). This mutual support system helped strengthen the bonds of fellowship within their communities.

In summary, early Christians expressed their fellowship through shared meals, house churches, prayer and worship, resource sharing, and mutual support. These practices not only reflected Jesus' teachings but also demonstrated the power of His love and unity in action.
