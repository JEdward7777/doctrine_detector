  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical practices that characterized early Christian fellowship, including shared meals, house churches, prayer and worship, resource sharing, and mutual support. The writer provides clear examples from Scripture to support their claims, which is impressive.\n\nThe response also acknowledges the importance of these practices in fostering deeper connections among believers, aligning with the specified concern. However, the connection could be strengthened by explicitly highlighting how contemporary Christians can apply these ancient principles to build stronger relationships today.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the writer might consider providing more specific and practical examples of how these fellowship practices can be adapted to modern contexts, such as online communities or small groups. Nevertheless, this response is well-written, informative, and thoughtfully engages with the concern at hand."
