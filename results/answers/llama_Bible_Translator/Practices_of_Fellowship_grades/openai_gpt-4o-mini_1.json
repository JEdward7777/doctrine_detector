  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and thoughtful explanation of how early Christians expressed fellowship, incorporating Scripture references and highlighting various practices such as breaking bread, house churches, prayer, resource sharing, and mutual support. The answer effectively addresses the concern by illustrating how understanding these historical practices can help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with one another. The only minor improvement could be to directly mention the importance of worship in expressing fellowship, as it is a significant aspect emphasized in early Christian communities."
