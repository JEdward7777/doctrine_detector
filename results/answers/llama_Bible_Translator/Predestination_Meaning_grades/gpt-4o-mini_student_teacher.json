  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of predestination in a Christian context, referencing relevant biblical passages and theological implications. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of specificity. The reference answer succinctly states that predestination refers to God deciding beforehand that certain individuals will receive eternal life, whereas the student's response expands on this with additional details and explanations. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could have more closely aligned with the reference answer in terms of conciseness."
