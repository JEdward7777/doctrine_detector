  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the privileges adopted children of God receive as mentioned in Romans 8:14-15. The student accurately identifies the privileges of inheritance and sonship/sisterhood, supported by relevant Scripture references. The practical implications of these privileges on the believer's life are well-explained and connected back to the biblical passage. The response also effectively highlights the new identity in Christ and the blessings of being part of God's family. Great job!"
