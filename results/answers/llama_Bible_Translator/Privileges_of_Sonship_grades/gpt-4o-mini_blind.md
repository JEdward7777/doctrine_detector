## [Answer](../Privileges_of_Sonship.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Romans 8:14-15, the adopted children of God (those who are in Christ) receive the following privileges:

"For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God. The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirsâ€”heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ." (Romans 8:14-15)

As adopted children of God, we receive the following privileges:

1. **Inheritance**: As "heirs of God" and "co-heirs with Christ", we are guaranteed an eternal inheritance in the presence of God (Ephesians 1:11; Galatians 3:26).
2. **Sonship/Sisterhood**: We are recognized as sons and daughters of God, with all the rights and privileges that come with being a child of the Father (Romans 8:16-17).

These privileges are not just abstract concepts but have practical implications for our lives:

* As children of God, we can approach God confidently, knowing that He is our loving Father who desires to hear from us and respond to our needs.
* We can rely on His guidance and leading through the Holy Spirit, trusting that He will direct us in His ways (Romans 8:14).
* We are secure in our relationship with Him, knowing that nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:35-39).

These privileges remind us of our new identity in Christ and the incredible blessings we receive as a result of being adopted into God's family.
