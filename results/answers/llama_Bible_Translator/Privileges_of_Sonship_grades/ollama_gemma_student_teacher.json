  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the privileges bestowed upon adopted children of God, referencing relevant scriptures to support their claims. They clearly articulate the spiritual benefits of being adopted, including inheritance, sonship/sisterhood, and a personal relationship with God. The inclusion of practical implications adds depth to the response. However, the answer would benefit from expanding on the unique privilege of calling God \"Abba, Father,\" as highlighted in the reference answer."
