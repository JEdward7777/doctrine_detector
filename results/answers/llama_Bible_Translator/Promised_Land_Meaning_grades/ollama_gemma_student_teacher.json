The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the various passages in Genesis that relate to the promise, and clearly explains the extent of the land that God promised to Abraham's descendants. The connection between the Promised Land and God's ultimate plan for redemption through Jesus Christ is also thoughtfully discussed."
