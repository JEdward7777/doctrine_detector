## [Answer](../Promised_Land_Meaning.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of God's covenant with Abraham, the "Promised Land" (Hebrew: כְּנַעַן, Kena'an) refers to the land that God has promised to give to Abraham and his descendants as an inheritance. This promise is first made in Genesis 12:1-3, where God says:

"Leave your country, your people and your father's household, and go to the land I will show you. 'I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will perform the oath I swore to Abraham your father: I will make you prosper.' 

"I called him back suddenly by day, saying, 'Abraham!'

'Here I am,' he replied.

Then God said, 'Do not lay a hand on the man; do not do anything to harm him. For now I know that the fear of God is with him, and he will be the one to keep his ways pure.' 

And so, Abraham did as God had instructed him."

Here, God promises to give Abraham's descendants this land, but it's a promise without specifications about where or when this would happen.

Later in Genesis 15:18-21, God reiterates and expands on the promise:

"On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, 'To your descendants I give this land from the Wadi Euphrates to the Mediterranean Sea— from the desert to the River Euphrates—all the land of Kena'an.'"

In this passage, God specifies the extent of the land He has promised to Abraham's descendants: from the Wadi Euphrates (a river in present-day Turkey) to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the desert to the River Euphrates. This is the "Promised Land" that becomes a central theme in the biblical narrative.

The Promised Land represents God's provision and blessing for Abraham's family, as well as His promise to establish a divine presence among them. It also foreshadows the eventual establishment of Israel as God's chosen nation, with Jerusalem as their capital.

As you can see, the term "Promised Land" is closely tied to God's covenant with Abraham and His ultimate plan for redemption through Jesus Christ.
