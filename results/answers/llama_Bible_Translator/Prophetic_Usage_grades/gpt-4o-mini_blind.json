The student effectively references relevant passages from the Old Testament and makes connections to the New Testament, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective. One suggestion for improvement could be to deepen the analysis of the Messianic significance of the term in relation to Jesus Christ and His role in fulfilling prophecies regarding the Daughter of Zion."
