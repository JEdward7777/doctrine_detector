## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the New Testament, the primary purpose of exhortation (or encouragement) is to motivate and enable believers to live out their faith in a way that honors God and reflects Christ's character. This is often referred to as "building each other up" or "strengthening one another in the faith."

In 1 Thessalonians 2:11-12, Paul explains that his exhortation was motivated by a desire to encourage the believers to walk in a manner worthy of God, who called them into His own kingdom and glory. Similarly, in Hebrews 10:23-25, the author encourages the readers to consider one another to stir up love and good works, which implies that exhortation is meant to stimulate believers to live out their faith with greater passion and purpose.

In many passages, the New Testament emphasizes the importance of building up the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 14:26; Ephesians 4:11-13), and exhortation plays a crucial role in this process. By encouraging one another in our walk with God, we are reminded of His promises, empowered to persevere through challenges, and motivated to share the Gospel with others.

Ultimately, the primary purpose of exhortation is to bring glory to God by helping believers grow in their faith, serve each other, and bear witness to Christ's redeeming love in a dark world.
