  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provided a thorough and well-referenced explanation of the primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament. They supported their answer with specific verses from the Bible and effectively communicated how exhortation is meant to motivate and enable believers to live out their faith in a way that honors God. The student also highlighted the importance of building up the body of Christ through encouragement and emphasized the ultimate goal of bringing glory to God.\n\nWhile the student's answer aligns closely with the reference answer from the teacher, they could have explicitly mentioned the aspect of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, as this was the specific emphasis of the reference answer. This omission is why the student's grade is slightly lower than a perfect score."
