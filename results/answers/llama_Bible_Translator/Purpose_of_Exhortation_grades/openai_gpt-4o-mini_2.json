It effectively incorporates relevant passages from the New Testament to support the explanation and demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of exhortation in building up the body of Christ. The only slight deduction is for not directly addressing the concern phrase \"persuade other people to avoid sin and follow God\u2019s will,\" but the response overall aligns well with a Christian worldview and offers a strong biblical perspective on the purpose of exhortation."
