  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive and biblical answer to the question, addressing the practical application of holiness in a believer's life. It starts by grounding itself in Scripture, quoting passages from 1 Peter, 1 John, John, 2 Timothy, Galatians, Matthew, Romans, Hebrews, and James to support its points. The response then provides nine specific principles for living a holy life, including seeking intimacy with God, conforming to God's Word, obeying God's will, fleeing from sin, walking in love, being intentional with time and resources, seeking accountability and community, praying and seeking wisdom, and fixing one's eyes on eternity.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is by providing more specific examples or applications of these principles. While the response does provide some general guidance, it would be helpful to see more concrete illustrations of how these principles can be applied in everyday life.\n\nOverall, however, this response is well-written, biblical, and provides a clear and compelling vision for what it means to live a holy life as a Christian."
