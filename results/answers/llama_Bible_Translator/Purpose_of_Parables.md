## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I can confidently say that Jesus used parables for several purposes, but primarily to convey spiritual truths and principles in a way that was both accessible and challenging to His listeners.

Firstly, parables allowed Jesus to speak to people on multiple levels. On one hand, they were simple enough for common folk to understand the basic moral of the story. However, on the other hand, they also contained deeper layers of meaning that only became apparent to those who were seeking spiritual truth and willing to dig deeper.

Secondly, parables enabled Jesus to convey complex theological concepts in a way that was both relatable and memorable. By using everyday scenarios and characters, He could illustrate abstract ideas like the kingdom of God, salvation, and the nature of God Himself. This made His teachings more engaging and easier to retain than if He had simply presented them as dry doctrine.

Thirdly, parables allowed Jesus to challenge His listeners' assumptions and misconceptions about God and His ways. By using unexpected characters or plot twists, He could subvert common notions about power, status, and righteousness, revealing a God who is both merciful and just.

Finally, parables showed that Jesus was not afraid to use storytelling as a means of preaching the kingdom. As the ultimate Teacher, He knew that stories had the power to captivate hearts and minds, making His message more compelling and persuasive.

In summary, Jesus used parables primarily to:

1. Convey spiritual truths in an accessible yet challenging way.
2. Illustrate complex theological concepts using everyday scenarios.
3. Challenge listeners' assumptions and misconceptions about God.
4. Showcase His authority as the ultimate Teacher, using storytelling to preach the kingdom.

By employing these powerful tools, Jesus demonstrated His wisdom, creativity, and commitment to communicating the good news of God's love in a way that would resonate with people from all walks of life.
