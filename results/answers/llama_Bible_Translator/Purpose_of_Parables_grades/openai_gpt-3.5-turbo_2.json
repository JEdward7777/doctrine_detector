It effectively addresses the concern of understanding Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith from a Christian perspective. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of how parables served multiple purposes in conveying spiritual truths, challenging assumptions, and showcasing Jesus' authority as a Teacher. Well done!"
