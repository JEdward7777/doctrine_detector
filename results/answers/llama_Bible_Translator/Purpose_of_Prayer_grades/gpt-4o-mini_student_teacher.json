  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed answer outlining multiple key purposes of prayer as supported by scripture. They effectively highlighted various aspects of prayer such as communication with God, worship, seeking guidance, intercession, confession, intimacy, faith, obedience, protection, spiritual growth, and glorifying God. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly linking these purposes to the concern of recognizing the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life, as indicated in the given reference answer. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and provided insightful reflections on the importance of prayer in a Christian's walk with God."
