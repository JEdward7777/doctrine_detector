  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the role of Psalms in the worship practices of the nation of Israel, highlighting various aspects such as daily worship, weekly worship, special occasions, and liturgical rites. They effectively connected the Psalms to specific events and practices in the Israelite worship context. However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the expression of a wide range of emotions in the Psalms, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer. Emphasizing the emotional depth and breadth of the Psalms would have enhanced the overall depth of the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
