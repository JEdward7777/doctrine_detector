  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the purposes of tests that God allows believers to experience, all grounded in Scripture. It aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing spiritual growth, purification, faith-strengthening, character revelation, and comforting others as key purposes of trials. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding the nature of tests can influence a believer's response to difficult circumstances. The only minor improvement could be further elaboration on how tests help believers turn away from sin specifically to fully address the given answer."
