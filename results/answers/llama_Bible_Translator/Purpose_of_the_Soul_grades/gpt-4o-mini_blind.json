  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-rounded and detailed explanation of how the soul relates to a person's relationship with God as described in scripture. They have effectively highlighted key biblical references and theological concepts while staying true to Christian doctrine. The answer could be further enhanced by connecting each point more explicitly to specific scriptural passages to deepen the theological analysis. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
