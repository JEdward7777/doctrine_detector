  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful explanation of Jesus being called \"Rabbi\" in the New Testament and highlighted the significance of Nathanael's confession about Jesus' divine authority. However, the student's answer strays from the concern by focusing more on Jesus' divine role rather than the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. The student could have connected the traditional role of a rabbi with Jesus as the ultimate teacher and the fulfillment of God's laws to better address the concern."
