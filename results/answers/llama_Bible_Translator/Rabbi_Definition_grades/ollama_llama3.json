  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"Rabbi\" in Jewish tradition, which addresses the concern about understanding rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. However, it does not fully develop the significance of Nathanael's use of the title \"Rabbi\" to refer to Jesus in John 1:49.\n\nThe response also does not explicitly connect Nathanael's recognition of Jesus as \"Rabbi\" to his subsequent confession that Jesus is the Son of God and King of Israel, which could strengthen its argument. Additionally, while the response mentions the emphasis on Jesus' divine authority and messianic claim, it could further explore how this usage of the term \"Rabbi\" reflects Jesus' unique role as both teacher and Savior.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance of Nathanael's use of the title \"Rabbi\" in John 1:49, but could benefit from more development and connection to the broader theological implications."
