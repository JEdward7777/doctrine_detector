It effectively connects the term \"Rabbi\" to Jesus as the divine authority and highlights the unique role Jesus holds as both a teacher and the Son of God. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian theology and the significance of Jesus as the Messiah within this context. Great job!"
