The answer effectively addresses the concern by exploring how the term \"Rabbi\" takes on a new meaning when applied to Jesus, emphasizing his divine authority and messianic role. The connection between rabbinic teaching in Jewish tradition and its significance in recognizing Jesus as the authoritative teacher and divine Savior is well articulated. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively integrates biblical references to support its points."
