  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately explains the significance of the term \"Rabbi\" in the context of Christian teaching, specifically focusing on its application to Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The student effectively demonstrates how the term goes beyond its traditional Jewish meaning to highlight Jesus' divine authority and messianic claim. The explanation is thorough and well-supported with biblical references. However, the response could have further emphasized how Jesus' role as Rabbi relates to and fulfills the rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, providing a deeper theological analysis."
