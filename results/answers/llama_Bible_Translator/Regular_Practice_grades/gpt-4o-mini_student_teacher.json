  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the significance and importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of believers, based on Paul's writings. While the student's answer expanded on the reasons for establishing the Lord's Supper beyond what was specifically mentioned in the reference answer, they accurately highlighted key aspects such as Christ's sacrifice, participation in His spiritual sacrifice, edification and unity among believers, and expressions of gratitude and worship to God. The student effectively connected these reasons back to the central theme of remembering and proclaiming the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the Lord's Supper."
