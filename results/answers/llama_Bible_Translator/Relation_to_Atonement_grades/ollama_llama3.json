  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe respondent has successfully clarified the differences and similarities between atonement and propitiation, which aligns with the concern. They have also provided biblical references to support their explanation (Romans 3:25-26; Hebrews 2:17). The analogy used to illustrate the difference between atonement and propitiation is helpful in making the concept more relatable.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement. While the respondent has mentioned that Jesus' sacrifice is seen as the means by which atonement and propitiation are accomplished, they could have further emphasized the significance of Christ's sacrifice in achieving reconciliation with God. Additionally, some readers might find the analogy a bit complex, so it would be helpful to provide more straightforward explanations.\n\nOverall, this response has provided a clear and concise explanation of the differences between atonement and propitiation, making it a strong effort overall."
