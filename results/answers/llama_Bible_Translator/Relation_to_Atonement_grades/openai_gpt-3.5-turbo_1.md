## [Answer](../Relation_to_Atonement.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In Christian theology, both "propitiation" and "atonement" are terms used to describe the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on behalf of humanity's sin. While they're related, there is a subtle distinction between them.

"Atonement" (Hebrew: כָּפָר, kaphar; Greek: ἰλασμός, ilasmos) refers to the act of making something right or reconciling through sacrifice. In biblical terms, atonement is the removal of sin's penalty and its consequences, restoring a relationship between God and humanity.

"Propitiation," on the other hand (Latin: propitiatio; Greek: ἱλασμός, hilasmós), specifically refers to the act of appeasing or placating God's wrath, which was incurred by human sin. Propitiation is the idea that Jesus' sacrifice was not only a removal of sin's penalty but also an offering to God Himself, calming His righteous indignation and reconciling Him to humanity.

In other words, atonement focuses on the restoration of our relationship with God, while propitiation highlights the satisfaction of God's justice and wrath against sin. Jesus' sacrifice is seen as a propitiatory act that appeases God's wrath and brings peace between God and humanity (Romans 3:25-26; Hebrews 2:17).

To illustrate this difference, consider the following analogy:

Atonement is like taking out a trash can from someone's house. You're removing the garbage that was there.

Propitiation is like having a difficult neighbor who's upset with you because of all the trash cans you've been throwing away. Propitiation is about going to your neighbor, apologizing for your actions, and offering to take out their trash for them. This act not only removes the offense but also shows respect and a willingness to make things right.

In both cases, Jesus' sacrifice is seen as the means by which atonement and propitiation are accomplished, resulting in our reconciliation with God (Romans 5:9-11).
