The use of relevant Bible passages to support the connection between repentance and God's righteous wrath is commendable. The response could have been strengthened by delving deeper into the concept of God's justice and mercy in relation to repentance, as well as emphasizing the role of Jesus Christ as mediator. Additionally, a clearer distinction between avoiding wrath versus experiencing mercy through repentance could enhance the theological depth of the answer."
