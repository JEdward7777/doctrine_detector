  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-supported answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the connection between repentance and the wrath of God according to the Bible. The response effectively explains how repentance is essential in avoiding God's judgment and receiving His mercy. However, a slightly higher grade could be awarded if the student had explicitly stated that the wrath of God is the righteous penalty for sin and emphasized repentance as a necessary response to God's holiness. Nonetheless, the student shows a strong comprehension of the topic."
