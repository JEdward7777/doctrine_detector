  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response only partially addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While it correctly identifies Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas, it does not explicitly highlight the importance of this event in maintaining the apostolic leadership structure established by Jesus. Additionally, the response's accuracy is limited due to its simplicity and lack of biblical context, only mentioning Judas' betrayal and death without referencing the actual events surrounding his replacement (Acts 1:21-26). To improve, the response could provide more detail on the significance of Matthias' selection and how it reflects God's sovereignty in guiding the early Christian community."
