## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the New Testament, Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot as one of the twelve apostles (Acts 1:21-26). The apostles gathered together after Jesus' resurrection and asked if anyone could take Judas' place. Two men, Joseph called Barsabas (also known as Justus) and Matthias, were nominated for the position. After praying and casting lots, it was determined that Matthias was the one chosen by God to replace Judas.

In Acts 1:23-26, we read:

"So they put forward two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. Then they prayed and said, 'You, Lord, who knows the hearts of all people, show which of these two you have chosen to take over this apostolic ministry that Judas Iscariot left to go about his own way.' They drew lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles." (NIV)

Comment: The response only partially addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While it correctly identifies Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas, it does not explicitly highlight the importance of this event in maintaining the apostolic leadership structure established by Jesus. Additionally, the response's accuracy is limited due to its simplicity and lack of biblical context, only mentioning Judas' betrayal and death without referencing the actual events surrounding his replacement (Acts 1:21-26). To improve, the response could provide more detail on the significance of Matthias' selection and how it reflects God's sovereignty in guiding the early Christian community.
