## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the New Testament, Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot as one of the twelve apostles (Acts 1:21-26). The apostles gathered together after Jesus' resurrection and asked if anyone could take Judas' place. Two men, Joseph called Barsabas (also known as Justus) and Matthias, were nominated for the position. After praying and casting lots, it was determined that Matthias was the one chosen by God to replace Judas.

In Acts 1:23-26, we read:

"So they put forward two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. Then they prayed and said, 'You, Lord, who knows the hearts of all people, show which of these two you have chosen to take over this apostolic ministry that Judas Iscariot left to go about his own way.' They drew lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles." (NIV)
