  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately cites the biblical passage from Acts describing how Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot as one of the twelve apostles. It demonstrates an understanding of the succession of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension as described in the New Testament. The only slight concern is that the response doesn't explicitly mention the specific process of prayer and casting lots used to select Matthias, which is a key aspect of the biblical account. Overall, a strong answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
