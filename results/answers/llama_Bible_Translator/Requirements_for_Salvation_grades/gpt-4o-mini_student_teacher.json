  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer detailing the biblical basis for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the answer lacked explicit mention of repentance as a requirement for salvation, which is a crucial aspect of Christian belief according to the reference answer provided by the teacher. While the explanation was thorough and accurate concerning faith, a stronger emphasis on the need for repentance would have aligned the response more closely with the specific Christian worldview."
