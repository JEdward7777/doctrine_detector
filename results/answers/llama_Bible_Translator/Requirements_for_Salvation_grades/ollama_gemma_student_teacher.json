They provide thorough biblical references to support their claims and clearly articulate the essential elements of salvation according to Christian theology: faith in Jesus Christ as the only means of salvation, acknowledgment of sinfulness, and dependence on Jesus as the exclusive path to God the Father. The response aligns perfectly with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
