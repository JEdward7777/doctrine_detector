## [Answer](../Response_to_the_Crucifixion.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Acts 2:22-23, when Peter addressed the crowd on the day of Pentecost, he said:

"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to a cross."

In this passage, Peter is not addressing the crowd regarding their individual roles in the crucifixion, but rather he is highlighting the role of the Jewish leaders and the Roman authorities who were responsible for Jesus' execution. By saying that they "put him to death with wicked men", Peter is pointing out that the crowd was complicit in the process by allowing it to happen.

However, it's important to note that Peter's focus here is not on assigning blame or guilt, but rather on proclaiming the truth of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection as an act of God's plan and salvation for humanity.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response as 85.

This response accurately reflects Peter's emphasis in Acts 2:22-23, highlighting the collective responsibility of the crowd for Jesus' crucifixion while also emphasizing God's plan and redemption through Jesus' resurrection. The response correctly identifies that Peter's focus is not on assigning blame or guilt but rather proclaiming the truth of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection as an act of God's plan.

The only area where this response could improve is by more explicitly connecting Peter's sermon to the call to respond to the gospel. While it mentions repentance and faith, it does not elaborate on how this sermon specifically invites the crowd to respond to the good news of Jesus Christ.

Overall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of Acts 2:22-23 and its relevance to the early church's preaching and call to respond to the gospel.
