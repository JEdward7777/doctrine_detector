## [Answer](../Response_to_the_Crucifixion.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Acts 2:22-23, when Peter addressed the crowd on the day of Pentecost, he said:

"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man was handed over to you by God's deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to a cross."

In this passage, Peter is not addressing the crowd regarding their individual roles in the crucifixion, but rather he is highlighting the role of the Jewish leaders and the Roman authorities who were responsible for Jesus' execution. By saying that they "put him to death with wicked men", Peter is pointing out that the crowd was complicit in the process by allowing it to happen.

However, it's important to note that Peter's focus here is not on assigning blame or guilt, but rather on proclaiming the truth of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection as an act of God's plan and salvation for humanity.

Comment: The response effectively captures the essence of Peter's message from Acts 2:22-23, emphasizing the collective responsibility of the crowd in Jesus' crucifixion and the importance of repentance and faith in response to the gospel. The Christian worldview is upheld by highlighting the role of God in raising Jesus to life and the need for a personal response to the message preached by the early church.
