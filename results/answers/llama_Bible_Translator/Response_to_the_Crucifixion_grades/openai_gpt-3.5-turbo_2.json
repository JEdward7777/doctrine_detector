  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively analyzes Peter's preaching in Acts 2:22-23 and the call to respond to the gospel in terms of emphasizing God's role in raising Jesus to life and the need for repentance and faith. The interpretation aligns well with a Christian worldview, recognizing the importance of the resurrection in salvation history. The grade could be improved by incorporating a deeper theological reflection on the implications of the crowd's role in the crucifixion within the context of God's redemptive plan."
