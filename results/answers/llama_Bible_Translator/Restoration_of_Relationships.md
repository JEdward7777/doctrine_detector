The concept of restoration in the context of sin and salvation is a central theme in Scripture, particularly in the New Testament. When we say that God restores sinful people back to Himself, we're talking about His grand plan to redeem humanity from the ravages of sin and reconcile us to Himself.

In Genesis 3:17-19, after Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden, God pronounces judgment on the human condition: "Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat from it all your life. It will grow thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat bread until you return to the ground, since dust you are and to dust you will return."

This sets the stage for humanity's estrangement from God due to sin. As a result of Adam's disobedience, all human beings inherit his fallen nature (Romans 5:12-19), which is characterized by rebellion against God, selfishness, and sin.

However, in Jesus Christ, God provides the means for restoration. Through His life, death, and resurrection, Christ bridges the gap between God and humanity, making it possible for sinful people to be restored to a right relationship with their Creator (Ephesians 2:1-10; Colossians 1:19-23).

Restoration in this context involves three key aspects:

1. **Justification**: This is the instantaneous declaration of righteousness for those who put their faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 3:24). It's as if God says, "You are no longer counted as a sinner, but as righteous in My sight."
2. **Regeneration**: This is the spiritual rebirth that occurs when someone becomes a believer in Christ. As a result of this new birth, they receive a renewed heart and a desire to live according to God's will (John 3:1-8; Ephesians 2:10).
3. **Sanctification**: This is the ongoing process of becoming more like Jesus Christ as believers surrender their lives to Him. Sanctification is not about earning salvation but rather about experiencing the transforming power of God's love and grace in daily life (Romans 6:1-14; Hebrews 12:14).

In summary, when God restores sinful people back to Himself, He declares them righteous through justification, gives them new life through regeneration, and empowers them for a life of obedience through sanctification. This restoration is not only a one-time event but also an ongoing process as believers walk with Jesus throughout their lives (2 Corinthians 5:17).
