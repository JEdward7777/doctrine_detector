## [Answer](../Resurrection_Definition.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In a Christian context, the term "resurrection" refers to the bodily return of Jesus Christ from death to life, as prophesied and promised by God (e.g., Psalm 16:10; Acts 2:31). This event is seen as a pivotal moment in human history, marking the beginning of salvation for humanity.

According to the New Testament, Jesus was crucified on the cross, buried, and sealed in a tomb. But on the third day after his death, he rose from the dead, appearing to his followers, including Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostle Paul (Matthew 28:5-7; Luke 24:1-12; John 20:11-13).

In Christian theology, Jesus' resurrection is seen as a demonstration of God's power over death and sin. It is also considered proof that Jesus was who he claimed to be â€“ the Son of God, sent to save humanity from its sinful state (Romans 10:9-10; 1 Corinthians 15:3-8).

The concept of resurrection has significant implications for Christian theology. It:

1. Verifies Jesus' claims about himself: Jesus predicted his own death and resurrection, which proved his divine authority.
2. Validates the atoning work of Christ: Through his death and resurrection, Jesus provided a way for humanity to be reconciled to God (Romans 5:10; Colossians 2:13-15).
3. Offers hope for believers: The promise of eternal life through Jesus' resurrection gives Christians hope that they too will experience bodily resurrection on the last day, when they will be raised in glory and given a new, sinless body (1 Corinthians 15:50-54; Philippians 3:20-21).
4. Demonstrates God's triumph over evil: The resurrection of Jesus is seen as a decisive defeat of Satan, sin, and death, paving the way for humanity to experience redemption and eternal life.

In summary, in a Christian context, the term "resurrection" refers to the miraculous return of Jesus Christ from death to life, which serves as a testament to God's power, validates Jesus' claims about himself, offers hope for believers, and demonstrates God's triumph over evil.
