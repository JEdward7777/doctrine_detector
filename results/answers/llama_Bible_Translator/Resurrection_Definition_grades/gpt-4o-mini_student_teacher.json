  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that delves into the significance of Jesus' resurrection in Christian beliefs. They effectively highlighted the theological implications and the hope it offers to believers. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the direct act of resurrection itself and its impact on Christian beliefs about life after death, as stated in the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic."
