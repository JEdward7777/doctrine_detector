  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid analysis of Luke 6:37 and its implications for how we should approach judging others. The student effectively connects the concept of judgment to condemnation, emphasizing the importance of humility and self-reflection. The integration of additional scripture references, such as 1 Corinthians 4:3-5 and Matthew 7:1-2, enhances the theological depth of the response. One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the role of God's sovereignty in judgment, ensuring that the focus remains on relying on His wisdom rather than our own."
