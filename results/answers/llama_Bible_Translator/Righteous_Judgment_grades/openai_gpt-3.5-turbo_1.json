  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and well-explained analysis of how God's wrath and love coexist without contradiction in Biblical teaching. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the complementary nature of God's attributes and how they are reconciled through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The response is well-supported with relevant biblical references and demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian theology."
