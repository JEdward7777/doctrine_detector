It demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical teachings on the topic and effectively addresses the concern regarding the coherence of God's attributes. The integration of scriptural references and the emphasis on Christ's atoning sacrifice further strengthen the argument. Overall, this response provides a strong Christian perspective on the relationship between God's wrath and His loving nature."
