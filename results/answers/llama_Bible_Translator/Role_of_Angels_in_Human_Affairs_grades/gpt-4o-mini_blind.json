  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and comprehensive overview of the ways angels serve God according to biblical references. The inclusion of relevant scripture verses supports the points made. However, the response could be strengthened by emphasizing the hierarchy and obedience of angels to God, highlighting their role as messengers and servants rather than equals to humans in worship. Additionally, stating more explicitly the distinction between the intercession of angels versus the intercession of Christ would enhance doctrinal clarity."
