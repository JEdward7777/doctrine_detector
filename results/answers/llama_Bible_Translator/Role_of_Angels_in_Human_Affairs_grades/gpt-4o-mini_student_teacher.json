  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that details various ways angels serve God according to biblical references. However, the answer could have been improved by aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by focusing on delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening God's people, and communicating on God's behalf. The student's response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding the roles of angels in perceiving divine intervention, but it could have been more concise and directly related to the specified concern."
