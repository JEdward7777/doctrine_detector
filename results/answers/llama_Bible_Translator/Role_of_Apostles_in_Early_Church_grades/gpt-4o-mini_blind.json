  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response that explores key lessons from the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers. The answer effectively highlights important aspects such as the emphasis on personal relationships, shared responsibility, diversity, inclusivity, accountability, correction, and mutual encouragement. The scriptural references used to support these points are relevant and help to strengthen the argument. The student's application of these principles to building strong, biblical communities today is commendable. One area for improvement could be providing more depth and insight into how these lessons can be practically applied in modern church settings. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response."
