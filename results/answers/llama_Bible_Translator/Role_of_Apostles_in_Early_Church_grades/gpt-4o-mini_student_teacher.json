  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers, drawing upon specific biblical examples to support their points. They covered key aspects such as personal relationships, shared responsibility, diversity and inclusivity, accountability and correction, and mutual encouragement and support, demonstrating a solid understanding of how these principles were exemplified by the apostles.\n\nHowever, deducting a few points for slightly missing the mark on the reference answer provided by the teacher, which focused specifically on teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer as foundational elements for the growth and unity of the early church. While the student's response touched on these elements indirectly, they could have more directly aligned their discussion with the reference answer.\n\nOverall, the student showed a strong grasp of the topic and provided valuable insights into the lessons we can learn from the apostles' actions in building strong, biblical communities."
