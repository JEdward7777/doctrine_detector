  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful elaboration on the foundational principles of community building within the early church as modeled by the apostles. The additional points raised about personal relationships, shared responsibility, diversity and inclusivity, accountability and correction, and mutual encouragement and support further enrich the understanding of how these principles are integral to Christian community life. The scriptural references are well integrated to support the theological perspective presented."
