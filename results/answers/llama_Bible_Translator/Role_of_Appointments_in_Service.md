What a wonderful question!

As Christians, we are called to fulfill various roles within the Church, which is the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27). These roles are not just limited to pastors or leaders but involve every member. Here are some ways we are called to fulfill our appointed roles:

1. **Spirit-led Service**: The Holy Spirit empowers us for service (Acts 1:8), guiding and gifting us for specific ministries within the Church (Romans 12:3-8). As we yield to His leading, He enables us to serve others in love.
2. **Giftedness**: Each believer possesses unique spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12:4-11), which are meant to be used for the common good of the Church (1 Corinthians 12:7). We should discover and utilize our gifts to build up one another.
3. **Submission**: As Christians, we submit to God's sovereign will and to each other within the Church (Ephesians 5:21; 1 Peter 5:2-4). This submission is not a hindrance but rather an expression of trust in God's wisdom and care for His people.
4. **Accountability**: As believers, we are accountable to one another within the Church (Matthew 18:15-20), encouraging and correcting each other in love (Galatians 6:1-2).
5. **Love and Humility**: We are called to demonstrate Christ-like love and humility (Philippians 2:3-4) as we serve one another, recognizing that our roles are not about elevating ourselves but about exalting the Savior.
6. **Worship and Praise**: As a community, we gather to worship and praise God together (Hebrews 10:24-25), acknowledging His sovereignty and majesty in all things.
7. **Evangelism and Discipleship**: We are commissioned to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:18-20) and to spread the Good News of Jesus Christ (Acts 1:8). This includes both evangelizing those outside the Church and nurturing believers within it.

In summary, as Christians called to fulfill our appointed roles within the Church, we are:

* Empowered by the Holy Spirit
* Gifted for service
* Submissive to God's will and each other
* Accountable to one another
* Exemplifying love and humility
* Gathering in worship and praise
* Commissioned to evangelize and disciple

May our roles within the Church be marked by a deepening dependence on Christ, a growing understanding of His character, and a commitment to serving Him and others with joy!
