  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid and comprehensive overview of the various ways Christians are called to fulfill their roles within the Church. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses to support each point is commendable. However, to improve the grade, the student could focus on further emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's Word and the authority of Scripture in guiding and defining these roles within the Church. Strengthening the doctrinal foundation and referencing additional scriptural passages could enhance the depth of the response."
