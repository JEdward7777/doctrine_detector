  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90. \n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive answer that addresses various aspects of how Christians are called to fulfill their roles within the Church. They covered the importance of being Spirit-led, using spiritual gifts, submission, accountability, love and humility, worship, evangelism, and discipleship. \n\nThe answer aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of serving others, using gifts for the edification of the Church, and advancing God's kingdom. The only improvement would be to directly reference the central point of advancing God's kingdom, as mentioned in the reference answer."
