The blood in the Passover event, as described in Exodus 12:1-30, has great significance in both Jewish and Christian traditions.

In Exodus 12:7-8, God commands the Israelites to take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood of a lamb, and apply the blood to the doorposts and lintels of their homes. This act was meant to "mark" or "set apart" the Israelite households from the rest of Egypt, so that the angel of death would pass over them when killing the firstborn sons of every Egyptian family.

The significance of the blood in this context can be understood on several levels:

1. Redemption: The blood represents a payment or redemption for the Israelites' lives. Just as the blood of the lamb was applied to the doorposts, so too did Jesus Christ shed His own blood as a sacrifice for humanity's sins (Hebrews 9:12-14). This act of redemption allows us to "pass over" from spiritual death to eternal life.
2. Covenant Seal: The application of blood to the doorposts serves as a sign or seal that the Israelites are under God's covenant protection. In a similar way, believers in Jesus Christ can look forward to the promise of eternal life and safety under His divine protection (John 3:16).
3. Remedy for Sin: According to Hebrews 9:14, the blood of animals could not take away sins, but rather pointed to the need for a greater sacrifice â€“ Jesus Christ. The Passover event foreshadowed the true redemption that would come through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.
4. New Beginnings: The application of blood was a ritual act that marked the beginning of a new era in Israel's history. In a similar way, believers in Jesus Christ experience a "new birth" or spiritual rebirth when they accept Him as their Lord and Savior (John 3:5-7).

In conclusion, the significance of the blood in the Passover event is multifaceted, representing redemption, covenant protection, remedy for sin, and new beginnings. These themes are echoed throughout Scripture, culminating in Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross, which offers eternal life and forgiveness to all who put their faith in Him.
