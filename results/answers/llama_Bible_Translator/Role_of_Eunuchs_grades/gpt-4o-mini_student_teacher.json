  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned and thoughtful response that incorporated relevant Biblical references and insights. They effectively connected the role of eunuchs in ancient times to the broader theme of God using individuals, regardless of their physical state, to fulfill His purposes. However, there was some misinterpretation in the analysis of Jesus' words regarding eunuchs in Matthew 19:12. The student slightly missed the mark in fully addressing the concern of understanding the value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom."
