  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of Jesus' role in our salvation, covering key aspects such as substitutionary atonement, propitiation, redemption, justification, sanctification, exaltation, and advocacy. The student effectively references relevant Bible verses to support each point. The answer could be improved by incorporating a clearer emphasis on the role of faith in salvation and the importance of personally accepting Jesus as Savior. Additionally, a deeper connection to the concept of grace as an undeserved gift from God could enhance the completeness of the response."
