## [Answer](../Role_of_Jesus.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a wonderful question!

The Bible presents Jesus as the central figure in God's plan of salvation, and His role is multifaceted. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Substitutionary Atonement**: Jesus took the punishment for humanity's sins upon Himself. He became sin for us (2 Corinthians 5:21) and bore the wrath of God that we deserved (Romans 3:25, Isaiah 53:5). By doing so, He satisfied God's justice and provided a way for sinful humans to be reconciled to Him.
2. **Propitiation**: Jesus is our propitiatory sacrifice, which means He turned away God's wrath and restored the possibility of a right relationship between God and humanity (1 John 2:2, 4:10).
3. **Redemption**: Through His death and resurrection, Jesus purchased our freedom from sin's slavery (Galatians 3:13, Hebrews 9:15). He redeemed us from the curse of the law (Galatians 3:13) and restored us to a right relationship with God.
4. **Justification**: Jesus' sacrifice provides justification for those who put their faith in Him. Justification means we are declared righteous, not because of our works, but solely due to His work on the cross (Romans 3:24-25, Galatians 2:16).
5. **Sanctification**: As believers, Jesus also sanctifies us, setting us apart for God's use and conforming us to the image of His Son (John 17:17, Ephesians 5:26).
6. **Exaltation**: Through His resurrection and ascension, Jesus was exalted to the right hand of the Father, where He intercedes on behalf of believers (Romans 8:34, Hebrews 7:25) and reigns as our High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-15).
7. **Advocate**: As our Advocate, Jesus stands in defense of us before God's throne, ensuring that His sacrifice is applied to our lives and that we are covered by His blood (1 John 2:1-2).

In summary, Jesus' role in salvation is multifaceted:

* He took the punishment for humanity's sins
* He turned away God's wrath and restored a right relationship between God and humans
* He redeemed us from sin's slavery
* He justified us through His sacrifice
* He sanctifies us as believers
* He exalted Himself to intercede on our behalf
* He stands in defense of us before God's throne

These aspects of Jesus' role are all rooted in the Bible's teachings and provide a comprehensive understanding of His part in our salvation.
