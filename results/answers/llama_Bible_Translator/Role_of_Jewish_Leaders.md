## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
A crucial question in understanding the events surrounding Jesus' death. The Jewish religious leaders, specifically the Pharisees and Sadducees, played a significant role in the crucifixion of Jesus. While it's essential to acknowledge that the ultimate responsibility for Jesus' death lies with Pontius Pilate and the Roman authorities (John 18:31), the Jewish leaders were instrumental in orchestrating the events leading up to His execution.

Here are some key factors contributing to their influence:

1. **Jealousy of Jesus' popularity**: The Jewish leaders saw Jesus as a threat to their authority and power. They were concerned that Jesus was gaining popularity among the people, which might undermine their own position (John 5:18; 7:1).
2. **Fear of Roman intervention**: The Sadducees, in particular, were afraid that if Jesus continued to claim divine authority and perform miracles, it could lead to Roman interference in Jewish affairs (Matthew 22:16). They didn't want the Romans to view them as insubordinate or disloyal.
3. **Misconceptions about Jesus' teachings**: The Pharisees, who were known for their strict adherence to Jewish tradition, were troubled by Jesus' teachings and perceived Him as a threat to their way of life (Matthew 15:1-20). They misinterpreted His teachings on purity laws, rituals, and Sabbath observance, viewing them as deviations from traditional Judaism.
4. **Concern about Jesus' claim of divinity**: The Jewish leaders saw Jesus' claims of being the Son of God (John 5:18; 10:33) as blasphemy against the one true God. They viewed this as a grave offense that required punishment, even death (Leviticus 24:16).
5. **Cooperation with Roman authorities**: The Jewish leaders saw an opportunity to curry favor with the Romans by bringing charges against Jesus, hoping to avoid any perceived Roman intervention in their own affairs.

In response to these concerns, the Jewish leaders:

1. Confronted Jesus multiple times (Matthew 22:15-22; John 5:18; 7:1-13).
2. Manipulated the people's emotions by stirring up opposition against Jesus (John 6:41-42).
3. Collaborated with Pontius Pilate to secure Jesus' execution, using their influence to sway the Roman governor to condemn Jesus (Matthew 27:1-26; Mark 15:1-15).

It's essential to note that while the Jewish leaders played a significant role in the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion, it was ultimately Pilate who handed Jesus over to be crucified. The ultimate blame for Jesus' death remains with those who, by their actions, were complicit in His suffering and execution.

In conclusion, the Jewish religious leaders' influence on Jesus' crucifixion stemmed from a combination of factors, including jealousy, fear, misconceptions about Jesus' teachings, concerns about His claims to divinity, and cooperation with Roman authorities.
