The analysis is thorough and well-supported with Biblical references. It effectively considers the complex interplay between religious authority and civil power during that time. The only area for improvement would be to specifically tie in the rejection of Jesus as the Messiah as a central component of the Jewish leaders' influence on His crucifixion, to align more closely with a Christian worldview perspective."
