What an excellent question!

In 2 Samuel 12:1-14, the prophet Nathan confronts King David about his sin of adultery and murder by using a powerful parable. The parable is found in verses 6-7:

"David asked, 'Is this the time you're going to give me judgment? Tonight He did not eat from my table or drink from my well, nor did I give him any rest! What he had with me was very small, just a little bit of land, a plot of ground. He didn't allow anyone else to run up and down before him. So I asked you (He) and did not take anything away from you except the one ewe lamb, but it belonged to him and he had taken care of it!'"

In this parable, Nathan cleverly used a scenario that was familiar to David - the story of a rich man who owned many flocks and herds, but took only one little ewe lamb that belonged to his poor neighbor, leaving the neighbor with nothing. The rich man did not even allow anyone else to graze their animals on his land, including the poor man's sheep.

Nathan then confronted King David by saying, "You are that man!" (v. 7). By using this parable, Nathan was pointing out David's sin and comparing it to the rich man's actions. Just as the rich man took something precious from someone who had nothing left, so too did David take something precious from Bathsheba - her purity and innocence.

This parable served several purposes:

1. It allowed Nathan to confront David's sin without directly accusing him of adultery.
2. It used a familiar scenario that resonated with David's own experiences as a shepherd and king.
3. It highlighted the injustice and selfishness of David's actions, just as the rich man's actions were unjust and selfish.

Through this powerful parable, Nathan convicted King David of his sin and led him to repentance and restoration.
