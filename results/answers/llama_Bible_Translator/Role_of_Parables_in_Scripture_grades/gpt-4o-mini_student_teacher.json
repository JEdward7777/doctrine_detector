  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful analysis of how the prophet Nathan utilized a parable in his confrontation with King David. The answer effectively explains the purpose and impact of the parable in convicting David of his sin. However, the response could be further strengthened by directly aligning with the reference answer and focusing more explicitly on the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives."
