  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the use of parables in the Bible, specifically in the context of Nathan confronting King David about his sin. It effectively illustrates how parables can serve as a tool for correction and revelation, leading to acknowledgment and repentance. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical narrative and presents a cohesive analysis from a Christian worldview perspective. Well done!"
