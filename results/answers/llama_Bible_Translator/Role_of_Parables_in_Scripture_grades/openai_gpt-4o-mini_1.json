  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the use of the parable in 2 Samuel 12 as a tool for correction and revelation in biblical narratives. It demonstrates a clear understanding of how parables can be strategically employed to confront sin and prompt repentance. The connection between the parable of Nathan and King David's sin is well-analyzed and supported with relevant biblical references. Overall, this is a strong and insightful interpretation from a Christian worldview perspective."
