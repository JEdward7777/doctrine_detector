  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and insightful analysis of how the parable in 2 Samuel 12:1-14 was used by the prophet Nathan to confront King David about his sin. It effectively explains the significance of using a parable as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, demonstrating a strong understanding of the biblical context and the intended purpose of the parable. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to perhaps directly reference the initial answer in the response to further connect the analysis to the specific concern provided."
