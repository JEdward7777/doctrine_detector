The student effectively outlines the roles of priests as intermediaries between God and His people, their duties in offering sacrifices, interceding for the people, teaching God's laws, performing purification rituals, and serving as leaders. Additionally, the student correctly emphasizes that the Old Testament priests were a foreshadowing of Christ's role as the ultimate High Priest, in line with Christian doctrine. Well done!"
