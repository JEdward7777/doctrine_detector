In the Old Testament, the primary responsibility of priests was to serve as intermediaries between God and His people (Exodus 28:1; Leviticus 8:29). They played a crucial role in facilitating worship, offering sacrifices, and teaching God's laws. Some of their key responsibilities included:

1. Offerings and Sacrifices: Priests were responsible for offering animal sacrifices on behalf of the people to atone for sins (Leviticus 4:20; Hebrews 5:1). They also offered grain offerings, incense, and other types of sacrifices (Leviticus 2:1-16).
2. Intercession: Priests served as mediators between God and humanity, offering prayers on behalf of the people (Psalm 109:4; Job 42:8).
3. Teaching and Law Enforcement: Priests were responsible for teaching God's laws to the people and ensuring they were obeyed (Deuteronomy 33:10; Malachi 2:7).
4. Purification and Cleansing: Priests performed rituals for purification and cleansing, including washing garments and offering sacrifices to remove impurities (Leviticus 14:1-32; Numbers 19:1-22).
5. Priestly Functions: Priests performed various duties, such as anointing kings, consecrating priests, and overseeing the sacred institutions of the temple and its services.
6. Mediating God's Word: As guardians of God's revelation, priests played a crucial role in interpreting and applying Scripture to everyday life (Deuteronomy 33:10; Malachi 2:7).
7. Serving as Leaders: Priests often served as leaders among their people, providing guidance and direction (Numbers 11:16-30; Deuteronomy 31:9).

It's important to note that the Old Testament priests were not a replacement for Christ, but rather a foreshadowing of His role as the ultimate High Priest (Hebrews 7:1-3).

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the Old Testament priests' roles and responsibilities, accurately referencing biblical verses to support the points. It effectively addresses the concern regarding understanding the biblical role of priests from a Christian worldview. The only missing aspect is a direct mention of the priest's role in purification and cleansing rituals, which is an essential part of their duties according to the Old Testament.
