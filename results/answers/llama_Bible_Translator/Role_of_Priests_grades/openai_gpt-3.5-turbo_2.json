  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the primary responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, detailing their role as intermediaries between God and His people, their duties in offering sacrifices, interceding for the people, teaching God's laws, conducting purification rituals, and serving as leaders. The content is well-supported by relevant biblical references. Additionally, the response appropriately acknowledges the Old Testament priests as a precursor to Christ's ultimate role as the High Priest. The only minor improvement could be offering a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview, emphasizing the significance of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment and ultimate High Priest in the New Testament."
