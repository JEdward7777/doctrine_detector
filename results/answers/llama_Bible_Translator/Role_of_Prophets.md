## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Bible, the primary role of a prophet is to be God's messenger, speaking on behalf of Yahweh (the Lord) to communicate His words and will to others. Prophets are called by God to proclaim His message to His people, warning them of impending judgment if they turn away from Him, and encouraging them to repent and return to Him.

In the Old Testament, prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were commissioned by God to speak His words to the Israelites. Their primary tasks included:

1. Declaring God's judgment: Prophets warned the people of impending judgment if they continued in their sinful ways, disobeying God's commands.
2. Calling for repentance: They called on the people to turn back to God, acknowledging their sinfulness and seeking His mercy.
3. Revealing God's plan: Prophets revealed God's plans and purposes for Israel, including promises of restoration and redemption.
4. Interpreting God's actions: Prophets explained God's actions in history, such as the conquest of Canaan or the Babylonian exile, helping the people understand God's sovereignty and justice.

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is often referred to as a prophet (Matthew 21:11, John 4:19), and His teachings are seen as prophetic in nature. The apostles Peter, John, and Paul also exercised prophetic ministries, speaking God's words and will to the early Christian churches.

Throughout Scripture, prophets were called to be God's mouthpiece, communicating His message with clarity and authority. Their role was not just to predict future events but also to declare God's character, justice, and mercy to a world in need of redemption.
