  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated understanding of the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible. They accurately highlighted key aspects such as being God's messenger, warning of judgment, calling for repentance, revealing God's plan, and interpreting God's actions. The inclusion of examples from both the Old and New Testaments further enriched their response. However, the answer could have been improved by directly stating the primary role in a more concise manner, closer to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
