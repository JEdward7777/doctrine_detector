It effectively connects key biblical passages and teachings on repentance, forgiveness, and salvation. The integration of the parable of the prodigal son and the centrality of faith in Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice further strengthens the argument. The response could have elaborated more on the role of God's grace in the process of forgiveness, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. Great work!"
