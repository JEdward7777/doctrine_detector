  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-rounded explanation of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees within the Jewish temple system during the time of Jesus. They accurately reference biblical accounts and historical context to support their points. However, the student's answer does not specifically mention the Sadducees performing priestly tasks such as offering sacrifices, which was a crucial aspect of their role as indicated in the reference answer. This omission slightly detracts from the completeness of the response, but overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
