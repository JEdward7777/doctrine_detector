  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 40.\n\nThe main responsibility answer is not entirely accurate, as it only mentions taking care of the temple complex and performing priestly tasks, which is an incomplete understanding of the Sadducees' roles. While the response does acknowledge their involvement in the Temple establishment, it lacks specificity and fails to capture the full range of responsibilities listed in the biblical account.\n\nRegarding the concern about exploring the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus, this response shows some attempt to engage with the historical context by mentioning the Sadducees' roles within the Temple establishment. However, it could be more thorough in its exploration of their beliefs and practices, as well as their relationship with other Jewish leaders and groups during that time.\n\nTo improve this response, the writer could provide a more accurate and detailed description of the Sadducees' responsibilities, and further explore the historical context in which they operated."
