## [Answer](../Role_of_Sadducees.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I must rely on the biblical account and historical records to answer your question.

According to the New Testament, the Sadducees were a group of Jewish leaders who held positions within the Temple establishment in Jerusalem during the time of Jesus Christ (Matthew 5:20; Mark 12:18-27). Their main responsibilities included:

1. Serving as members of the Sanhedrin, a council of elders that governed the Jewish community and oversaw the administration of justice.
2. Providing spiritual guidance and interpretation of Jewish scriptures to the people.
3. Preserving and maintaining the Temple rituals and traditions.
4. Managing the Temple treasury and ensuring its financial integrity.

However, it's important to note that the Sadducees were also known for their skepticism about the supernatural and their denial of the resurrection (Matthew 22:23; Mark 12:18). They were primarily interested in maintaining the current Jewish traditions and practices, rather than seeking a deeper spiritual connection with God.
