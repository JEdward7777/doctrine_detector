The student effectively references specific examples from the Bible, such as Jesus' use of Old Testament scriptures, Paul's apologetics in Acts, Peter's sermon at Pentecost, Paul's letters, and the evangelistic encounter on the road to Emmaus. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the importance of using Scripture to proclaim the Gospel message and supports their points with relevant biblical references. Great job overall!"
