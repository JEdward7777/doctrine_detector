As a Christian Bible translator, I'd be happy to shed light on this important question!

In the Old Testament, the high priest played a crucial role in the temple worship and held several unique responsibilities that distinguished him from other priests. Here are some of these distinctive duties:

1. Annual Sacrifice: As recorded in Leviticus 16, the high priest was responsible for performing the annual sacrifice for the sins of Israel, known as the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). This ritual involved offering a goat and a ram to atone for the people's sins.
2. Temple Maintenance: The high priest was in charge of maintaining the temple and its furnishings, including the Ark of the Covenant. He ensured that the temple remained clean and free from impurities.
3. Consultation with God: As the chief representative of Israel before God, the high priest would consult with the Lord to determine the will of God for the nation. This involved seeking guidance on matters of war, peace, and national importance.
4. Intercession: The high priest was responsible for interceding on behalf of the people before God. He would offer prayers and sacrifices for the nation's sins, asking for forgiveness and restoration.
5. Garment of Glory: When Aaron (the first high priest) entered the Holy of Holies, he wore a special garment known as the ephod, which signified his unique relationship with God. This tradition continued throughout Israel's history.
6. Representation before God: As the representative of Israel before God, the high priest was responsible for ensuring that all offerings and sacrifices were made in accordance with God's laws and regulations.

These responsibilities distinguished the high priest from other priests in Israel, who primarily focused on performing daily worship services and handling temple duties. The high priest held a special position as the chief mediator between God and humanity, making him accountable to ensure the spiritual well-being of the nation.

In Christian theology, Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate High Priest who intercedes before God on behalf of believers (Hebrews 7:25-28). His sacrifice on the cross has removed the need for animal sacrifices, and He now serves as our Mediator and Advocate in heaven.
