  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that highlighted the unique responsibilities of the high priest in Israel's worship practices, demonstrating a solid understanding of the significance of the high priest's role. The student also connected this Old Testament concept to Christian theology by referencing Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest. However, the student's response may have included more details than necessary, straying slightly from the direct comparison of unique responsibilities between the high priest and other priests in Israel as requested in the question."
