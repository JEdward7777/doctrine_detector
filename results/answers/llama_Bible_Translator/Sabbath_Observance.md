According to Exodus 20:8-11 and Deuteronomy 5:12-15, keeping the Sabbath holy means observing the seventh day of the week (Saturday) as a day of rest and worship. The commandment states:

"Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore He blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy." (Exodus 20:8-11)

The original purpose of the Sabbath commandment was to provide a regular day of rest for God's people, allowing them to reflect on His creation, and acknowledge His sovereignty over all things. It was not just about physical rest, but also spiritual refreshment.

In the biblical context, keeping the Sabbath holy involves:

1. Not doing any work: This includes manual labor, business dealings, and personal activities that could be considered work.
2. Worshiping God: The Sabbath is a day for corporate worship, offering prayers, singing psalms, and reading Scripture.
3. Spending time with family and community: The Sabbath was designed to bring families together, strengthening bonds of love and unity.
4. Reflecting on God's creation: The Sabbath is an opportunity to contemplate God's works and marvel at His power and wisdom.

In the New Testament era, Jesus Christ redefined the purpose of the Sabbath in Mark 2:27-28, saying:

"The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. So then, the Lord also rested on the first day of the week."

This passage suggests that the true purpose of the Sabbath is to bring rest and refreshment to humanity, rather than simply following a set of rules or regulations. However, this does not negate the importance of observing the seventh day as a day of worship and remembrance.

In conclusion, keeping the Sabbath holy according to the commandments given to Moses means setting aside one day in seven for physical and spiritual rest, corporate worship, family bonding, and reflection on God's creation.
