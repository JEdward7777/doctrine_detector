## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Exodus 16:23-26, when God instructed the Israelites to gather manna on the sixth day of the week, He gave them a specific command regarding the Sabbath:

"And he said, 'This is that which the Lord hath spoken: Tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord. Bake that which thou hast brought forth in the oven; and that which thou hast boiled set thee to boil; and that which thou hast dried, dry thou; and store it up for thee according to the commandment of Moses, so that it may be kept till the morning.'"

In this passage, God commanded the Israelites to gather an extra day's supply of manna on the sixth day (Friday), but with a specific instruction: they were not to bake, boil, or dry any of the gathered manna. This meant that the manna would spoil and be unusable by the next morning, which was the Sabbath.

In essence, God was setting a boundary for His people regarding the observance of the Sabbath. By not allowing them to prepare food in advance, He was teaching them to trust Him for their daily provision and to honor the Sabbath as a day of rest from labor (Exodus 20:8-11).
