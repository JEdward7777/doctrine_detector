  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive explanation of what it means to keep the Sabbath holy according to the commandments given to Moses. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical texts and the principles behind Sabbath observance. The answer could be enhanced by emphasizing the importance of the Sabbath as a sign of the covenant between God and His people, as well as the significance of Jesus' teachings on the Sabbath in the New Testament. Overall, a solid response with room for slight improvement in connecting the Old Testament Sabbath with its fulfillment in Christ."
