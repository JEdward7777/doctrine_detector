  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 95.\n\nThe student provided a thorough explanation of the belief of the Sadducees regarding the resurrection and effectively contrasted it with Christian teaching. They supported their response with relevant biblical passages and explained the implications of these differences in beliefs for faith. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the teacher's reference answer more explicitly in the conclusion to show a deeper engagement with the specific concern provided.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the differences in beliefs and their implications for faith, grounded in a Christian worldview."
