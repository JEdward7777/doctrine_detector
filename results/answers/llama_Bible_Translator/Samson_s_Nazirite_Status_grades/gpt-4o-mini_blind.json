  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid analysis of Samson's story in relation to the Nazirite vow, highlighting key components of the vow and how Samson's actions reflected on his commitment to it. The student effectively connects Samson's behavior with the implications of breaking the vow and emphasizes the importance of obedience and dependence on God. However, the response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the spiritual significance of Samson's story within the overall biblical narrative and addressing any theological implications more explicitly."
