  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured explanation of the sanctification process for believers in Jesus as described in the New Testament. They highlighted both the initial sanctification at salvation and the ongoing progressive sanctification throughout the believer's life. The response effectively addressed the concern by emphasizing the role of faith in sanctification and the importance of believers' continuous growth in Christlikeness. The student's detailed analysis and incorporation of relevant Bible verses demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic. However, the reference answer from the teacher was more concise and focused on the core message of God sanctifying believers through faith in Jesus. Consequently, the student's response, while comprehensive, could have been more succinct in aligning with the essence of the reference answer."
