## [Answer](../Sanctification_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The sanctification process for believers in Jesus, as described in the New Testament, is a vital and ongoing aspect of their spiritual journey. While the New Testament does not provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to sanctification, it offers several key insights that help us understand this process.

**Initial Sanctification:**

At salvation, believers are set apart from sin's dominion through faith in Jesus Christ (Hebrews 10:10-14; 1 Corinthians 6:11). This initial sanctification is a one-time event where God makes believers holy and sets them apart for His purposes. It is often referred to as "positional" or "declarative" sanctification.

**Progressive Sanctification:**

As believers walk with Jesus, they experience progressive sanctification, which involves the gradual transformation of their minds, hearts, and actions (2 Corinthians 7:1; Ephesians 4:23-24; Philippians 3:12). This process is characterized by:

1. **Filling and Indwelling:** The Holy Spirit indwells believers, empowering them to live a life pleasing to God (Ephesians 5:18; Galatians 5:16).
2. **Growing in Christlikeness:** Believers are conformed to the image of Jesus through spiritual disciplines like Bible study, prayer, and fellowship (Romans 8:29; Philippians 3:21).
3. **Surrendering to God's Will:** As believers yield to God's guidance, they experience a deeper sense of obedience and surrender to His will (Matthew 16:24-25; Romans 12:1-2).
4. **Overcoming Sin and Fleshly Tendencies:** The Holy Spirit helps believers overcome sinful patterns and develop godly character traits like love, joy, peace, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23; Ephesians 3:16).

**Sanctification as a Life-Long Process:**

The New Testament presents sanctification as an ongoing process that continues until believers meet Jesus in glory. It is characterized by:

1. **Continuous Purification:** Believers are called to continually purify their hearts and minds, recognizing the presence of sin even after conversion (Matthew 5:8; James 4:7-8).
2. **Growing in Wisdom and Discernment:** As believers mature, they grow in wisdom and discernment, enabling them to navigate life's challenges with a deeper understanding of God's will (Colossians 1:9-10; Ephesians 5:15-16).
3. **Eager Anticipation of Final Sanctification:** The New Testament encourages believers to eagerly await their future glorification, where they will be fully sanctified and enjoy eternal life with Jesus (Romans 8:23-25; Philippians 3:20-21).

In summary, the New Testament presents sanctification as a two-stage process:

1. Initial sanctification at salvation
2. Progressive sanctification throughout the believer's life

This ongoing process involves growing in Christlikeness, overcoming sin and fleshly tendencies, and continually purifying one's heart and mind. Ultimately, believers look forward to their final glorification when they will be fully sanctified and enjoy eternal life with Jesus.
