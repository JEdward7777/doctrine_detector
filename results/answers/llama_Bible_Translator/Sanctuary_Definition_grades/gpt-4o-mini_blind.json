  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This is a very well-written and comprehensive answer that effectively explains the concept of sanctuary in the biblical context. The explanation is doctrinally sound, drawing from both the Old Testament practices and the New Testament fulfillment in Jesus Christ. The student effectively shows the progression from the physical sanctuary in the Temple to the spiritual understanding of believers being the temple of God. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include references to specific Bible verses to support each point made, although the student did well in referencing key verses."
