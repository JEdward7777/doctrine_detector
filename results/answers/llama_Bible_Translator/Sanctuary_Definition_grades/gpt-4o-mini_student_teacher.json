  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the term \"sanctuary\" within the Biblical context. They have effectively described the historical significance of the sanctuary in the Temple, the transition brought by Jesus Christ, and the broader theological implications for Christians. The student's answer aligns well with Biblical teachings while also acknowledging the evolution of the term in Christian theology. However, their answer could have been improved by directly addressing the core definition as provided in the reference answer, which emphasizes the concept of a 'holy place' set apart by God for protection."
