  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response starts off strong by referencing the biblical context and specifically mentioning the Tabernacle/Temple, which aligns well with the provided answer. It also provides some additional details about the physical sanctuary in the Temple complex.\n\nHowever, to reach a perfect score, I would have liked to see more elaboration on how Jesus' entry into the sanctuary (i.e., tearing the veil) has transformed our understanding of \"sanctuary\" and what it means for believers today. While the response touches on this point, it could be further developed.\n\nAdditionally, while the concern is about understanding the meaning and significance of the term \"sanctuary\" in the Biblical context, the response could also benefit from more explicit connections to Christian theology and the role of Jesus Christ in establishing a new sanctuary for believers. Nevertheless, overall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical concept of sanctuary and its significance.\n\nComment: The response provides a solid foundation for understanding the term \"sanctuary\" in the Biblical context, but could be strengthened by further elaboration on how Jesus' entry into the sanctuary has transformed our understanding of this concept."
