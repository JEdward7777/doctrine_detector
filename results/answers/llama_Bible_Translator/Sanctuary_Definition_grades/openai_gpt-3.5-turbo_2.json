It effectively demonstrates how the concept of sanctuary has evolved from the physical structure in the Temple to the spiritual understanding in Christianity as believers being the temple of God. The connection to Jesus as the ultimate high priest and sacrifice is well articulated, offering a solid Christian perspective on the significance of the sanctuary."
