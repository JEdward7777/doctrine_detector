  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively explains the term \"sanctuary\" in the biblical context by providing detailed information about its role in the Temple of God, the significance of the Holy of Holies, and the transition to Jesus Christ as the ultimate high priest and sacrifice. It accurately conveys the broader meaning of sanctuary in Christian theology and relates it to believers as the temple of God. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the term \"sanctuary\" within a Christian worldview."
