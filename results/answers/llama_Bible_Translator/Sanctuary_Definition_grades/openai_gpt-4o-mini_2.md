## [Answer](../Sanctuary_Definition.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the biblical context, the term "sanctuary" refers specifically to the most sacred and holy place within the Temple of God, where only the high priest could enter once a year on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:14-16). This sacred space was also known as the Holy of Holies.

The sanctuary was a physical structure within the larger Temple complex, designed to be a place where God's presence dwelled among His people. It was separated from the outer courtyard and the rest of the Temple by a veil or curtain (Exodus 26:31-35; Hebrews 9:3). Only the high priest, dressed in sacred robes, could enter this area once a year to make atonement for the sins of Israel (Leviticus 16).

However, Jesus Christ entered this sanctuary and tore the veil from top to bottom, signifying that He had become the ultimate high priest and sacrifice for humanity's sin (Matthew 27:51; Hebrews 10:19-22). Through His death and resurrection, Jesus opened up a new and living way for believers to have direct access to God, eliminating the need for a physical sanctuary or human intermediaries like the high priest.

In this sense, the term "sanctuary" has taken on a broader meaning in Christian theology. It refers to the place where we can find shelter, protection, and comfort in our relationship with God through Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that believers are now the temple of God, and their bodies are the sanctuary where the Holy Spirit dwells (1 Corinthians 6:19; Ephesians 2:22).
