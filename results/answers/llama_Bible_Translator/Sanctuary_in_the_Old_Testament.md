What a great question!

In the Old Testament, God describes the sanctuary (also called the Tabernacle) as a sacred space where He dwells among His people Israel. The sanctuary is not just a physical structure, but also a symbol of God's presence and covenant relationship with His people.

In Exodus 25:8, God instructs Moses to build the Tabernacle "according to all that you have been instructed on the mountain." This sacred space was designed to be a place where God would meet with His people, speak to them, and dwell among them. The sanctuary consisted of three main areas: the Outer Court, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place (or the Holiest of All).

The Outer Court represented the external aspect of worship, where the Israelites could come to offer sacrifices, make petitions, and seek God's guidance. This area was open to all, symbolizing God's desire for a universal relationship with His people.

The Holy Place was a more sacred space, representing God's special presence among His people. It contained seven golden lampstands (Exodus 25:31-40), which were lit by the high priest as an act of worship and dedication to God. The Holy Place was where the priests would offer daily sacrifices and perform various rituals.

The Most Holy Place, or the Holiest of All, was the innermost sanctuary, representing God's absolute holiness and transcendence. Only the high priest could enter this sacred space once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), carrying the blood of atonement to cleanse the people from their sins.

Throughout the Old Testament, the sanctuary is described as a place where God dwells among His people, providing guidance, protection, and redemption. The sanctuary was a tangible representation of God's presence and covenant relationship with Israel, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ (Hebrews 8-10).
