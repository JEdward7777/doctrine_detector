  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament. It accurately explains the significance of the Tabernacle as a sacred space for God to dwell among His people and details the different areas of the sanctuary and their purposes. The answer also appropriately links the Old Testament sanctuary to the broader themes of God's presence, covenant relationship, worship, and redemption. Great job! However, the response could further emphasize the importance of the sanctuary as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate redemption for a higher grade."
