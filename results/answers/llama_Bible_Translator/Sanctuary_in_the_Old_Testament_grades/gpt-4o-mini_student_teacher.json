  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful explanation of how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament, highlighting its significance as a place of God's presence among the Israelites. The student effectively connected the different components of the sanctuary to God's relationship with His people and the symbolism behind each area. However, the student could have emphasized more on the aspect of the sanctuary as a dwelling place and source of safety for God's people as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern but could have aligned more closely with the specific emphasis given in the reference answer."
