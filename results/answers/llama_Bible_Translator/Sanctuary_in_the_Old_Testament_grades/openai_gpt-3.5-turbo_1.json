It thoroughly explains the different areas of the sanctuary and their meanings within the context of God's presence and covenant relationship with Israel. The connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of redemption is also clearly articulated. This response demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern raised. Great job!"
