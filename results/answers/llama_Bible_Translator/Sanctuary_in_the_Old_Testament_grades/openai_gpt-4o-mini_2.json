  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the sanctuary in the Old Testament as a dwelling place for God among His people and a source of safety. It effectively expands on the concept, including details about the different areas of the sanctuary and their symbolic meanings. The response is well-supported by specific references from the Old Testament. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the concept of the sanctuary as a refuge or safe place for God's people with the broader theological implications of God's presence and protection in their midst."
