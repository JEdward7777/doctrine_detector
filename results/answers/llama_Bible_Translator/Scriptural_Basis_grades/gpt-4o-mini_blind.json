  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses supporting the concept of propitiation, demonstrating a good understanding of the doctrine. The selection and explanations of the verses were clear and aligned well with the Christian belief in Christ's sacrifice to appease God's wrath. Great job overall."
