  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer by citing relevant Bible verses that support the concept of propitiation. The verses referenced align well with the theological concept and offer a deeper understanding of how propitiation is linked to Christ's sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. However, the student could improve their answer by focusing on the key verses mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
