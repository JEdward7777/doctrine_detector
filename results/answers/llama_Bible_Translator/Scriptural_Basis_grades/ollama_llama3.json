  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of propitiation, supported by several key Bible verses that demonstrate its significance in God's plan for salvation through Jesus Christ. The provided verses include Romans 3:25-26, Hebrews 9:5-7, 1 John 2:2, and Isaiah 53:5-6, which is a good representation of the theological concept. Additionally, the inclusion of a broader context from Hebrews 10:5-14 provides further insight into Jesus' sacrifice as propitiation.\n\nWhile the response does not explicitly address other biblical references that support the concept of propitiation (e.g., Genesis 3:15, Leviticus 16:1-34), it still demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concept and its connection to Scripture. To achieve a higher grade, the response could provide more comprehensive biblical support or explore the implications of propitiation for our daily lives as Christians."
