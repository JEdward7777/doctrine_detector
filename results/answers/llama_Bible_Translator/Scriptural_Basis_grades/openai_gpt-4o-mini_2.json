  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the theological concept of propitiation with specific biblical references, providing a deeper understanding of the doctrine. The inclusion of key verses such as 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26 supports the explanation well. However, the response could be further strengthened by including additional verses like Hebrews 9:5-7 and Isaiah 53:5-6, as these verses also provide significant insights into the concept of propitiation in Christian theology. Overall, a thorough and well-supported response."
