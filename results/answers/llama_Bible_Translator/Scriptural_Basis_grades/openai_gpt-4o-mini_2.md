## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
Propitiation refers to the idea that God's wrath against sin was satisfied or appeased through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. Here are some key Bible verses that support this concept:

1. Romans 3:25-26 - "God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood, to demonstrate his justice, because he had previously put up with all the wickedness people committed; yes, from Adam’s time onward. And now he has shown where you can be justified in your sins and where you can have eternal life through Jesus Christ."
2. Hebrews 9:5-7 - "It is not possible for the blood of goats and bulls to take away sins. Therefore, when Christ was sacrificed, once for all, he took the sins of many with him and offered a sacrifice to God for them. For this reason, he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called can receive the eternal inheritance they were destined for."
3. 1 John 2:2 - "He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world."
4. Hebrews 10:5-14 - In this passage, Jesus is quoted as saying, "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, nor have I given a burnt offering to you." But God accepted the sacrifice of Jesus because it was perfect and sufficient to cover sin.
5. Isaiah 53:5-6 - This prophecy describes the Messiah's death as a means of atonement for sin: "He was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by whose wounds we have been healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray. Each of us has turned to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all."

These verses and others throughout Scripture demonstrate that propitiation is an essential aspect of God's plan for salvation through Jesus Christ.

Comment: The response effectively connects the theological concept of propitiation with specific biblical references, providing a deeper understanding of the doctrine. The inclusion of key verses such as 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26 supports the explanation well. However, the response could be further strengthened by including additional verses like Hebrews 9:5-7 and Isaiah 53:5-6, as these verses also provide significant insights into the concept of propitiation in Christian theology. Overall, a thorough and well-supported response.
