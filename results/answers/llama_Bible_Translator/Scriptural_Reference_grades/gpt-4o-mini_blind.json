  "grade_comment": "Grade: 82\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and insightful response on the biblical concept of \"the world\" in relation to believers. They accurately cited relevant passages and provided explanations based on the biblical context. However, the student could improve by incorporating more direct connections to believers' interactions with the world and emphasizing the importance of being in the world but not of it, as taught in Scripture. Additionally, a clearer distinction between worldly systems and the physical world itself would enhance the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological reflection."
