  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful response addressing the concept of \"the world\" in relation to believers through key biblical passages. They effectively highlighted the world's opposition to God's ways, the connection believers have with Jesus Christ, and the encouragement for believers to overcome worldly influences. While the student did not specifically reference the passages mentioned in the teacher's answer, their analysis and explanation demonstrate a strong understanding of the biblical concept in relation to believers navigating a world characterized by ungodly values."
