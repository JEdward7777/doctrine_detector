  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical concept of \"the world\" in relation to believers, referencing relevant passages from John and 1 Corinthians. The student clearly explains the opposition between the world and God's ways, the believer's connection to Jesus Christ, and the ability to overcome the world's influence. The response is well-organized, coherent, and thoughtfully written."
