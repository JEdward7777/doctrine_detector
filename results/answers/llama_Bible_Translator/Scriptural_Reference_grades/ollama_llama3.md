## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

The concept of "the world" (Greek: kosmos) in relation to believers is addressed in several biblical passages. Here are some key ones:

1. John 3:16-17 - This famous passage says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. What a wonderful gift! And this is the verdict: light has come into the world, but men do not welcome it."

Here, Jesus is talking about the world's rejection of Him, just as it rejected God the Father.

2. John 14:17 - In this passage, Jesus says, "You are in me and I am in you. I am no longer in the world, but they who belong to me are in the world; and though I am gone, my peace I leave with you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or worried."

Jesus is distinguishing between His own relationship with God the Father (being "in" Him) versus believers being "in" Jesus and thus connected to God.

3. 1 John 5:4-5 - This passage says, "For every child of God overcomes the world. The one who does wickedness has not seen God nor known him." In this context, "the world" refers to the sinful system that opposes God and His ways.

John is encouraging believers to overcome (or conquer) the world's influence by living according to God's will.

4. 1 Corinthians 2:12 - Paul writes, "Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us." Here, he contrasts the spiritual wisdom that comes from God with the worldly wisdom that doesn't come from Him.

These passages help clarify the biblical concept of "the world" in relation to believers. In summary:

* The world is a realm opposed to God and His ways.
* Believers are not part of this world; they are connected to Jesus Christ, who is the bridge between heaven and earth (John 14:17).
* As children of God, believers have been given the power to overcome the world's influence and live according to God's will (1 John 5:4-5).

May these passages guide our understanding of this important biblical concept!

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

This response does an excellent job of addressing the concern about navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values. The writer provides clear biblical passages that help clarify what "the world" means in relation to believers, and how we should interact with it. The summary at the end is also helpful in providing a concise overview of the key points.

However, I would deduct some points because the response does not directly address the concern about navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values. While the passages discussed do provide guidance on how to view and interact with "the world," they do not necessarily offer specific advice on how to navigate life as a believer in that world.

Additionally, I would have liked to see more application of the biblical principles to everyday life. The response is more focused on providing an overview of the biblical concept of "the world" rather than offering practical wisdom for living out one's faith in the midst of ungodly values.
