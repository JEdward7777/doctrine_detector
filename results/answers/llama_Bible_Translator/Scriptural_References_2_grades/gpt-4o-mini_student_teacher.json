  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer citing key biblical passages that support the concept of the Day of Judgment. The inclusion of relevant verses from Revelation, Matthew, 2 Corinthians, Romans, and Hebrews provides a comprehensive scriptural basis for the belief in judgment. However, the student missed referencing the specific passages mentioned in the teacher's reference answer, which could have further enriched the response."
