## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The concept of the Day of Judgment, also known as the Day of Wrath or the Great White Throne Judgment, is a crucial aspect of Christian eschatology. Here are some key biblical passages that support this doctrine:

1. Revelation 20:11-15 - This passage describes the final judgment, where all people will be judged according to their deeds. Those whose names are not found in the Book of Life will be cast into the lake of fire.

"And I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and heaven fled away; and there was found no more sea. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the book was opened which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."

2. Matthew 25:31-46 - In this passage, Jesus teaches about the final judgment, where nations will be separated from one another based on how they treated the least of these, His brothers (i.e., the righteous). Those who showed mercy and kindness to others will go to eternal life, while those who did not will go to eternal punishment.

"When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his flock. And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left."

3. 2 Corinthians 5:10 - Paul writes about the final judgment, where we will stand before God to give an account of our lives.

"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive according to the things which are done in his body, whether good or bad."

4. Romans 2:5-11 - This passage describes a day when God's righteous judgment will be revealed, and people will be judged based on their deeds.

"But after thy hardness and impenitent heart thou treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; Who will render to every man according to his works: To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath."

5. Hebrews 9:27 - This passage emphasizes the importance of Christ's sacrifice as a means to escape the wrath to come.

"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this cometh judgment."

These passages, among others, demonstrate that the Day of Judgment is a critical event in God's plan, where all people will be judged according to their deeds and receive eternal consequences.
