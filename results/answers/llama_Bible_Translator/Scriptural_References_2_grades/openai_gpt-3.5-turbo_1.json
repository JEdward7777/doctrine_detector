  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the concept of the Day of Judgment in Christian eschatology, supported by relevant biblical passages such as Revelation 20:11-15, Matthew 25:31-46, 2 Corinthians 5:10, Romans 2:5-11, and Hebrews 9:27. However, the response does not incorporate the additional key passages given in the provided answer (Luke 10:12, Luke 11:31, Luke 11:32, Matthew 10:15, and Matthew 12:36) to further deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment. Incorporating these passages would have enhanced the scriptural basis for beliefs on the Day of Judgment."
