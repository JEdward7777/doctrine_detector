  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the concept of the Day of Judgment in Christian eschatology, supported by key biblical passages. The additional key passages provided align well with the concern to deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs. The response could be enhanced by further elaboration on how these additional passages contribute to the overall understanding of judgment in Christianity."
