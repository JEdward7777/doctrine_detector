  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed analysis of Matthew 23:27-28, highlighting the internal nature of iniquity, the possibility of repentance, and the importance of humility. However, the student could improve by directly addressing the concern provided, which emphasizes the importance of pursuing genuine holiness over external compliance with religious standards. The student's answer does touch on integrity in faith, but a stronger connection to the specified concern would enhance the response."
