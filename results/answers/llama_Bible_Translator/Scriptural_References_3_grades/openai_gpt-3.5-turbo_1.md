# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
Matthew 23:27-28, which reads, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of the bones of the dead. On the other hand, when a wicked person turns away from the wickedness they have committed, the Lord can see that there is sincerity in their heart," teaches us several important truths about the nature of iniquity.

Firstly, it shows that iniquity or sin is not just external actions, but also internal attitudes and intentions. The Pharisees may have been following the letter of the law, but their hearts were far from God's. This highlights the importance of heart-attitudes in Christian living. Romans 3:19 says, "Now we know that whatever the law says it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and that the whole world may be held accountable to God." So, our actions are a reflection of what is inside us.

Secondly, this passage shows that even wicked people can turn away from their iniquity. The Pharisees' problem was not their outward behavior; it was their love for power, status, and self-righteousness. When they turned away from these attitudes and towards God's righteousness (Matthew 23:29-30), the Lord could see sincerity in their hearts. This teaches us that repentance is possible, and that it's not just about external actions but also internal change.

Lastly, this passage underscores the importance of humility and self-examination. Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees shows that even those who are supposed to be spiritual leaders can fall into sin and hypocrisy. This should encourage us to regularly examine our own hearts and lives, seeking God's guidance and correction (2 Corinthians 13:5).

In conclusion, Matthew 23:27-28 teaches us that iniquity is a matter of the heart, not just external actions; that even wicked people can turn away from their sin and towards righteousness; and that humility and self-examination are essential for living a life pleasing to God.
