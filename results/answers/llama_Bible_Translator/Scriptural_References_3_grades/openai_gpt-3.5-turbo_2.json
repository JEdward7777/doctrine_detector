It integrates additional Scriptures to support the Christian worldview and provides a thorough analysis of the implications of Matthew 23:27-28 for believers. The only minor deduction is for not directly addressing the concern of pursuing genuine holiness over mere external compliance, although this idea is indirectly implied throughout the response."
