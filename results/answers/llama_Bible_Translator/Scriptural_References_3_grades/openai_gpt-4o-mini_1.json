  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of Matthew 23:27-28 in connection with the given answer and concern. It effectively highlights the importance of internal attitudes and intentions in relation to iniquity, the possibility of repentance and internal change for even the wicked, and the significance of humility and self-examination. The connection to pursuing genuine holiness over external compliance is well-articulated, aligning with a Christian worldview. Great job in integrating scriptural references and providing a comprehensive evaluation."
