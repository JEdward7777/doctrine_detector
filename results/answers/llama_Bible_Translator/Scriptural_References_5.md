What a great question!

In the Old Testament, Hades is often depicted as a neutral place where both righteous and wicked souls go after death. However, in the New Testament, there appears to be a shift towards understanding Hades as a place primarily for the unrighteous.

One significant passage that contributes to this shift is Luke 16:19-26, also known as the Parable of Lazarus and the Rich Man. In this parable, Jesus describes two men who die: Lazarus, a poor man who is taken up by angels to be with Abraham in the bosom (Luke 16:22), and the rich man who is sent to Hades where he is tormented by fire and regret (Luke 16:23-24). This parable suggests that Hades is a place of torment for those who reject God's love and ignore their opportunity to respond to Him.

Another passage that reinforces this understanding is Peter's sermon in Acts 2:22-31. In his address to the crowd on Pentecost, Peter quotes Psalm 16:10, saying, "You will not let your Holy One see corruption" (Acts 2:31). He then applies this prophecy to Jesus' resurrection and concludes that David had to be buried in the tomb of Joseph because he was a righteous man, but Jesus was raised by God, demonstrating His power over Hades. This passage implies that only the righteous go to Abraham's bosom, while the wicked are sent to Hades.

Additionally, in 1 Peter 3:18-20 and 4:6, we see an emphasis on Christ's descent into Hades to proclaim the gospel even to those who had died without knowing God. This passage suggests that Hades is a place where the unrighteous reside, awaiting judgment.

Lastly, Revelation 20:11-15 describes the final judgment, where Hades is thrown into the lake of fire along with the beast and false prophet. This passage reinforces the idea that Hades is not just a neutral place for all the dead but rather a location where the wicked are punished for their deeds.

While these passages don't necessarily negate the Old Testament understanding of Hades as a neutral place, they do contribute to a shift in the New Testament towards understanding Hades as a place primarily for the unrighteous.
