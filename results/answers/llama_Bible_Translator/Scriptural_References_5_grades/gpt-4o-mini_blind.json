  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This is a well-written and thorough response that effectively addresses the question by citing relevant New Testament passages that indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades. The student accurately explains the shift towards viewing Hades as a place primarily for the unrighteous, supported by references such as the Parable of Lazarus and the Rich Man, Peter's sermon in Acts, Christ's descent into Hades, and the final judgment in Revelation. The incorporation of specific verses and explanations shows a strong understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview. Great job!"
