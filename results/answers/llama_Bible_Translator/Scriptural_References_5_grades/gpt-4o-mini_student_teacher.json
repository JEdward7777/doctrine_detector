  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that engages with multiple New Testament passages to illustrate the shift in understanding of Hades from a neutral place to a location associated with the unrighteous. The student's analysis of Luke 16:19-26, Acts 2:22-31, 1 Peter 3:18-20 and 4:6, and Revelation 20:11-15 effectively demonstrates the theological implications of these passages regarding the nature of Hades. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly referencing Luke 16:23 as the teacher's specified verse to emphasize the clear shift towards viewing Hades as a place for the unrighteous."
