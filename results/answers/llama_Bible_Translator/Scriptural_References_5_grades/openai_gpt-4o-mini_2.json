  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough analysis of various Biblical passages, demonstrating a clear understanding of the shift in the depiction of Hades from the Old Testament to the New Testament. The integration of multiple relevant passages, along with their implications for Christian eschatology, shows a strong grasp of the topic. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on the implications of this shift for Christian beliefs and practices."
