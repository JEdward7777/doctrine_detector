## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question! The passages you mentioned are indeed significant for understanding the concept of exaltation in Christianity. Let me break them down for you.

In 1 Peter 5:5-7, we see that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. Jesus, our Lord and Savior, is described as an example of humility. He didn't consider equality with God a thing to be grasped (Philippians 2:6). Instead, He humbled Himself by taking on human form and becoming obedient unto death (Philippians 2:8).

Now, here's where the concept of exaltation comes in. After Jesus' humble submission, God exalted Him to the highest position above all other names and powers (Philippians 2:9-11). This exaltation is not a contradiction of Jesus' humility; rather, it's the result of His obedience. By humbling Himself, Jesus earned the right to be exalted by God.

This passage illustrates two key aspects of Christian exaltation:

1. Humility precedes exaltation: Jesus' humility led to His exaltation. This teaches us that we must prioritize humility and submission to God's will in order to experience exaltation.
2. Exaltation is not a means to an end, but an end in itself: Jesus wasn't seeking exaltation as a way to gain power or recognition; rather, it was the natural consequence of His obedience. This passage encourages us to focus on serving others and glorifying God, rather than seeking our own exaltation.

In summary, the passages in 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11 illustrate that Christian exaltation is rooted in humility and obedience to God's will. It's not a means to gain power or recognition, but a natural consequence of living a life submitted to Christ.
