  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation supported by relevant scriptural references and practical application points. However, the student missed using the key references mentioned by the teacher in the reference answer. Integrating those key references would have strengthened the response in aligning with the specific concern provided. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of being blameless from a Christian perspective."
