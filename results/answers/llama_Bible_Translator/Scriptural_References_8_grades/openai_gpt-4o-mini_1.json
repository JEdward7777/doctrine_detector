  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of being blameless in a Christian context and effectively incorporates key scriptural references to support the argument. The practical application of these principles in guiding a Christian's life is well articulated. However, the initial reference provided in the answer by the student was not directly addressed or integrated into the response, which could have further enhanced the theological discussion. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview regarding righteousness and living a blameless life before God."
