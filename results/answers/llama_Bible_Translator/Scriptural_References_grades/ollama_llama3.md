The reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham can be found in Genesis 17:1, where it says:

"When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, 'I am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.'"

This verse is part of the book of Genesis, which is the first book of the Bible.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

The response accurately identifies the book and chapter where the reference to God as "Almighty" can be found, which aligns with the given answer. It also provides context by mentioning that Genesis is the first book of the Bible, which is relevant to knowing biblical references.

However, the response could be improved by expanding on the significance of this verse in relation to deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises. The concern emphasizes the importance of knowing biblical references for spiritual growth, but the response only scratches the surface by simply stating the reference without elaborating on its implications or relevance to our faith.

Overall, while the response provides some helpful information, it could be more impactful if it explored the significance of this verse and how it relates to our connection with God.
