  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response to the question, showcasing a strong understanding of the theme of restoration in the Bible. The student selected relevant verses and effectively explained their significance in illustrating God's desire for reconciliation and renewal. However, the student missed including some key verses mentioned in the teacher's reference answer, Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6. If these verses were included, the answer would have been closer to a perfect score. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid grasp of the concept of restoration in one's faith journey."
