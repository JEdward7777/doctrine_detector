The inclusion of additional verses (Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6) in response to the concern further enriches the discussion on finding scriptural support for restoration in one's faith journey. Overall, the response effectively integrates key biblical passages with the concept of restoration, aligning well with a Christian worldview."
