  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of a seared conscience and its implications for believers, showing a good understanding of the concept from a Christian worldview. However, there was a lack of direct engagement with the concern provided, which emphasized the importance of recognizing one's conscience for spiritual vigilance and integrity. The student could have related their discussion more explicitly to this concern in order to fully address the question in the context of spiritual vigilance and integrity."
