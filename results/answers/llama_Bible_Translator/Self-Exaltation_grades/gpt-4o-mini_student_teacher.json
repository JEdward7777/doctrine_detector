  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings. They effectively referenced relevant scriptures and demonstrated a strong understanding of the importance of humility and dependence on God. The answer aligned well with the concern of recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride, emphasizing the negative consequences of self-exaltation from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
