## [Answer](../Self-Exaltation.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Scripture, exalting oneself can be perilous and even lead to spiritual downfall. In fact, Jesus Christ himself warned against it in Luke 14:11, saying, "For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted." (NASB)

The Bible teaches that pride and self-exaltation are the enemies of humility and faithfulness to God. When we elevate ourselves above others or above God's will, we risk becoming puffed up with arrogance, which can lead to spiritual blindness (Luke 10:15; Matthew 23:12). This can result in a lack of dependence on God and an overreliance on our own abilities, leading to spiritual stagnation and even apostasy (1 Corinthians 3:18-19; Hebrews 6:4-5).

Furthermore, exalting oneself can also lead to idolatry. When we prioritize our own interests, desires, or achievements above God's glory and our relationship with Him, we risk worshipping the creation rather than the Creator (Romans 1:25). This can lead to a distorted view of ourselves and our place in the world, causing us to seek validation and approval from others instead of seeking it from God.

In contrast, Scripture teaches that true greatness comes from humility and dependence on God. When we humble ourselves before Him, He exalts us (Matthew 23:12; John 13:3-5). This is because a humble heart is one that recognizes its limitations, acknowledges God's sovereignty, and seeks His guidance and wisdom.

In summary, the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings include:

1. Spiritual blindness: Pride can lead us away from God's will and truth.
2. Apostasy: Our reliance on ourselves rather than God can result in spiritual abandonment.
3. Idolatry: Prioritizing our own interests above God's glory can lead to worshipping the creation rather than the Creator.
4. Distorted self-perception: Seeking validation from others rather than God can cause us to view ourselves in a way that is not pleasing to Him.

Let us strive for humility and dependence on God, recognizing that true greatness comes from exalting His name and will above our own.
