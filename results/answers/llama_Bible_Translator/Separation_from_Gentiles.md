## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Bible translator, I'd like to provide an accurate and nuanced answer.

The Pharisees were concerned about separating Jewish people from Gentiles (non-Jews) because they believed in maintaining strict adherence to Jewish law and tradition, particularly as outlined in the Torah. They saw themselves as guardians of Jewish purity and sought to preserve the distinctiveness of Judaism from other cultures and religions.

Specifically, the Pharisees were worried about:

1. Cultural contamination: They feared that interaction with Gentiles would lead to cultural assimilation, which could compromise Jewish values and practices.
2. Ritual impurity: In their understanding, certain aspects of Gentile culture, such as food preparation or worship practices, might bring ritual impurity into contact with Jewish people and ceremonies.
3. Idolatry: The Pharisees were concerned about the worship of other gods and idols among the Gentiles, which they saw as a direct challenge to God's sovereignty and the unique covenant between God and Israel.

These concerns were rooted in their interpretation of Jewish law (Torah) and tradition, which emphasized separation from idolatrous cultures. The Pharisees believed that by maintaining a clear distinction between Jew and non-Jew, they could preserve the integrity of their faith and community.

However, it's essential to note that this concern for separation did not necessarily imply hostility or hatred towards Gentiles. While some Pharisees may have been more extreme in their views, many others genuinely sought to share the message of God's redemption with non-Jewish people while maintaining the unique identity of Judaism.

In Christian theology, we understand that Jesus' teachings and actions challenged this Pharisaic perspective, emphasizing unity and inclusion rather than separation. As followers of Christ, we are called to love our neighbors, including those from other cultures and religions, and to share the Good News with all people (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 10:1-48).
