The student accurately identifies the Pharisees' motivations rooted in maintaining Jewish purity and adherence to the Torah. The explanation of concerns about cultural contamination, ritual impurity, and idolatry aligns well with historical and theological perspectives. Additionally, the mention of how Jesus' teachings challenged this perspective and emphasized unity and inclusion from a Christian standpoint adds depth to the analysis. A minor improvement could be made by further emphasizing the Pharisees' intentions were often based on sincere religious convictions rather than solely on cultural prejudices."
