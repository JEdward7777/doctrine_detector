  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-researched and detailed explanation of the Pharisees' concerns regarding the separation of Jewish people from Gentiles. They effectively discussed the cultural, ritual, and religious implications of this separation based on the Pharisees' interpretation of Jewish law. The student also made a valuable connection to Christian theology, highlighting Jesus' teachings on unity and inclusion. Despite some minor deviations from the reference answer in terms of emphasis, the student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
