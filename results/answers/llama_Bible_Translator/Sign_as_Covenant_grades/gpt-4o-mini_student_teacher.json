They included various aspects such as visual reminder, promise of safety, covenantal marker, type and shadow, and God's faithfulness. While their answer delves deeper into symbolism and additional theological perspectives, it could have been more concise and focused on the core concept of the rainbow as a reminder of God's promise not to destroy the earth with a flood again, as highlighted in the reference answer."
