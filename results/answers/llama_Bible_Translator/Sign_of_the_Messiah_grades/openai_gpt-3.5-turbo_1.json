The explanation is thorough, well-supported with biblical references, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological implications of the sign. The inclusion of key themes such as authenticating the message, God's attention to the marginalized, the glory of God, a call to worship and obedience, foreshadowing of the apostolic witness, and the connection between heaven and earth enriches the response and illustrates the profound significance of this specific sign in the context of God's divine plan."
