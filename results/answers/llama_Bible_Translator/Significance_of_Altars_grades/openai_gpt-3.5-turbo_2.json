The explanation aligns well with the concern provided, highlighting the importance of understanding altars in biblical worship for Christians to appreciate sacrifice and devotion in their faith. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a direct reference to Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice that fulfilled the need for ongoing animal sacrifices, tying in the concept of atonement in a Christian context."
