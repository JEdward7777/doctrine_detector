  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. The student effectively highlights the theological implications and contextualizes the use of the term. The explanation is well-supported with references to biblical examples and theological principles. However, the response could be strengthened by delving deeper into the doctrinal implications of God's nature as reflected in the use of \"Shaddai\" and could have included more Scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a strong answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
