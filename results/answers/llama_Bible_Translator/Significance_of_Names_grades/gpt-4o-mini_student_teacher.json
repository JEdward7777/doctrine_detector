  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name, aligning well with the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. The answer effectively discusses how translating it as a title emphasizes God's attributes of power, strength, and sovereignty, while also touching on the distinction from personal names and the contextualization within the biblical narrative. However, the answer could have incorporated more direct references to the personal relationship aspect highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher."
