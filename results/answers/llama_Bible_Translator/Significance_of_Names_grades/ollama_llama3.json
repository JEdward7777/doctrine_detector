  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name, highlighting its emphasis on God's power, strength, and sovereignty. The response also effectively addresses the concern by deepening our understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. The use of biblical examples and theological insights demonstrates a strong grasp of the subject matter.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to further develop the connection between Shaddai as a title and its implications for our relationship with God. While the response touches on this, it could be explored more thoroughly to provide a richer understanding of how this epithet can shape our theology and practice.\n\nComment: This is an excellent response that provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title. The connection between Shaddai's emphasis on God's power and sovereignty, and its implications for our relationship with God, could be further developed to take this response to the next level."
