## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Hebrew Scriptures, "Shaddai" (Hebrew: שַׁדַי) is a divine epithet used to describe God. The significance of translating it as a title rather than a name lies in its meaning and connotation.

The root of the word "Shaddai" is uncertain, but it may be related to the Hebrew words for "mountain" or "breastplate." In the biblical context, Shaddai is often used to describe God's power, strength, and sovereignty. For example, in Genesis 17:1-2, God appears to Abraham and reveals Himself as El Shaddai, which is often translated as "God Almighty" or "God Most High."

Translating Shaddai as a title rather than a name reflects its function as a descriptive term that emphasizes God's attributes and character. By using this epithet, the biblical authors sought to convey the majesty, power, and authority of God.

There are several reasons why translating Shaddai as a title is significant:

1. Biblical theology: Translating Shaddai as a title aligns with the biblical emphasis on God's character and attributes rather than His personal name. This approach reflects the biblical writers' focus on God's nature, power, and sovereignty.
2. Distinction from other divine names: By translating Shaddai as a title, it distinguishes it from other divine names, such as Yahweh or Elohim, which are often used to describe God's personal presence or His relationship with humanity. This distinction highlights the unique connotations of Shaddai and its emphasis on God's power and sovereignty.
3. Contextualization: Translating Shaddai as a title helps to contextualize it within its biblical context. It acknowledges that this epithet is often used in passages where God is described as powerful, all-knowing, or sovereign, which reinforces the theological importance of these attributes.

In summary, translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name reflects its function as a descriptive term that emphasizes God's power, strength, and sovereignty. This approach aligns with biblical theology, distinguishes it from other divine names, and helps to contextualize its significance within the broader biblical narrative.
