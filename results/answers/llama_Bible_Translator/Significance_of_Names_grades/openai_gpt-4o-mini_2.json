  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of why translating \"Shaddai\" as a title is significant in emphasizing God's attributes of power, strength, and sovereignty. It addresses the concern by highlighting the distinction between using \"Shaddai\" as a title to emphasize God's attributes and using it as a name to highlight a personal relationship with God. The discussion is well-supported with references to biblical theology and contextualization within the Christian faith. Overall, the response effectively deepens the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith."
