  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained answer regarding the significance of the Day of Pentecost in the New Testament. They have accurately highlighted key aspects such as the fulfillment of Jesus' promise, the birth of the church, the coming of the promised Helper, the manifestation of divine power, and the beginning of missionary activity. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers within a Christian worldview. However, the student's response could be improved by directly connecting these points to the central theme of understanding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers, as emphasized in the concern provided."
