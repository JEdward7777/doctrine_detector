It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. The explanation is detailed, supported by relevant Bible verses, and presented clearly. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate a brief mention of the importance of the unity and empowerment of the believers on Pentecost facilitated by the Holy Spirit."
