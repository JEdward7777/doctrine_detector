  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-supported explanation of the symbolic significance of unleavened bread in relation to sin and living a life that honors God. The use of Scripture references from Exodus and 1 Corinthians enhances the response's doctrinal correctness. The explanation of purification, humility, sincerity, sanctification, and dependence on God in relation to unleavened bread is well-articulated and aligns with Christian teachings. Great job overall."
