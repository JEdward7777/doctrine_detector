## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "tetrarch" (tetragonos in Greek) appears only once in the New Testament, specifically in Mark 6:14-29 and parallel accounts in Matthew 14:1-12 and Luke 9:7-9. In this context, the tetrarch is Herod Antipas, who was a Roman client king of Galilee and Perea from 4 BCE to 39 CE.

A "tetrarch" (tetragonos) literally means "ruler of a quarter," or one-quarter ruler. This title reveals that during Jesus' time, the governance structure in Judea was complex and divided into several regions or "quarters." Herod Antipas, as the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, held power over these specific areas.

This title also highlights the Roman influence on the region's politics. The Roman Empire had divided its territories into smaller provinces, each governed by a prefect or governor. In this context, the tetrarch Herod Antipas was a client king, appointed by the Romans to rule over his respective regions. This arrangement allowed Rome to maintain control while allowing local leaders to govern their own areas.

In summary, the title "tetrarch" indicates that during Jesus' time:

1. The governance structure in Judea was divided into smaller regions or "quarters."
2. Herod Antipas held power over Galilee and Perea as a Roman client king.
3. The Romans exercised significant influence on the region's politics through their appointment of governors and client kings like Herod Antipas.

This information provides valuable context for understanding the events surrounding Jesus' ministry, including his interactions with Herod Antipas and the broader political landscape of ancient Judea.
