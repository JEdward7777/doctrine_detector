  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the role of signs and miracles in authenticating the message of God through Jesus Christ and the early Church, aligning well with the given answer and concern. The writer provides clear examples from Scripture to support their arguments, including the miracles performed by Jesus and the apostles. They also delve into the multifaceted nature of these events, highlighting their role in authentication, witness to the resurrection, evangelism, and comfort and encouragement.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly addressed the relationship between faith and signs/miracles. While the writer touches on this topic briefly, a more explicit exploration of how faith interacts with signs and miracles would strengthen their argument and better align with the concern. Overall, however, this is an excellent response that effectively examines the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation.\n\nComment: This response is well-organized, clearly written, and effectively supports its arguments through biblical examples. The only area for improvement is that it could have more explicitly explored the relationship between faith and signs/miracles."
