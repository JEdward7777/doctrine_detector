It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how signs and miracles validate God's power and authority, strengthening the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation from a Christian worldview. The response is well-supported with biblical references and demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of miracles in the Christian faith. Great job!"
