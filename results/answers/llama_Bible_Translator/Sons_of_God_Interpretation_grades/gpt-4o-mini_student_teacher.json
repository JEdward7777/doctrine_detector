  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured explanation of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the specific concern of biblical interpretation and emphasizing the importance of understanding scripture passages within their cultural and theological context. Additionally, the student could have provided a more concise summary or synthesis of the interpretations presented."
