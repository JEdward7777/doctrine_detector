## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a wonderful question!

In the Christian faith, believers become saints when they die and go to be with the Lord in heaven. This is based on Scripture, specifically 1 Corinthians 6:13-14, which says, "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

As believers, we are united to Christ through faith and baptism. When we die, our souls (or spirits) go to be with the Lord in heaven, while our physical bodies remain on earth. At this point, we become saints because we have been made holy by our union with Christ.

This is not to say that we are sinless or perfect at the moment of death. Rather, through faith and baptism, we have been justified (declared righteous) and sanctified (set apart for God's purpose), making us saints in the eyes of God.

The term "saint" comes from the Greek word "hagios," which means "set apart for God." As believers, we are set apart for God's purposes when we put our faith in Jesus Christ. And at the moment of death, we become saints because we have been made holy by our union with Christ.

So, to answer your question, believers become saints through their death and subsequent resurrection into eternal life with God.

Comments: 
The student provided a generally accurate explanation of how believers become saints in the Christian faith. The student correctly referenced 1 Corinthians 6:13-14 and highlighted the importance of faith and baptism in uniting believers to Christ. However, there are some inaccuracies in the response. The statement that believers become saints only after death is not entirely accurate. In Christian theology, believers are considered saints not just after death, but also while they are alive on earth. Saints are those who are set apart for God's purposes and strive to live holy lives in obedience to Him. Additionally, the explanation of believers being made holy solely through their union with Christ at the moment of death might oversimplify the process of sanctification that believers experience throughout their lives. It would be beneficial for the student to include a more comprehensive understanding of sanctification in their explanation.
