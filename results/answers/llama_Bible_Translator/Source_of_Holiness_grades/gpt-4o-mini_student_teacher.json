  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good explanation of how believers become saints in the Christian faith, emphasizing the role of faith and union with Christ. However, there is a lack of clarity in directly attributing holiness to Jesus' saving work rather than simply union with Christ. The response could be improved by more explicitly stating that believers become saints not through their own actions, but through faith in Jesus and His work on the cross."
