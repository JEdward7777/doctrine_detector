  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately explains the Christian belief that believers become saints through their death and resurrection into eternal life with God. However, it could benefit from greater clarity in explaining how faith in Jesus Christ is the sole source of holiness for believers. The reference answer emphasizes this important aspect, and the student's response would be stronger if it explicitly acknowledged the central role of faith in the Christian doctrine of sanctification."
