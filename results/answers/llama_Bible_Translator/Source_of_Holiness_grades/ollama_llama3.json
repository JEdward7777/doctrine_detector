  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response closely aligns with the given answer, emphasizing that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ, rather than their own deeds. It also provides biblical support for this understanding from 1 Corinthians 6:13-14. The explanation of the term \"saint\" and its connection to being set apart for God's purposes is also well-done.\n\nThe concern about clarifying the source of holiness is nicely addressed by emphasizing that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus, rather than their own efforts or deeds. This reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus Christ in the Christian doctrine, as desired.\n\nOne area for improvement could be to further emphasize the role of baptism in union with Christ, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6:13-14. However, overall this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and aligns well with the given answer."
