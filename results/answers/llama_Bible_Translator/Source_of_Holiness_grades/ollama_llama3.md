## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a wonderful question!

In the Christian faith, believers become saints when they die and go to be with the Lord in heaven. This is based on Scripture, specifically 1 Corinthians 6:13-14, which says, "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

As believers, we are united to Christ through faith and baptism. When we die, our souls (or spirits) go to be with the Lord in heaven, while our physical bodies remain on earth. At this point, we become saints because we have been made holy by our union with Christ.

This is not to say that we are sinless or perfect at the moment of death. Rather, through faith and baptism, we have been justified (declared righteous) and sanctified (set apart for God's purpose), making us saints in the eyes of God.

The term "saint" comes from the Greek word "hagios," which means "set apart for God." As believers, we are set apart for God's purposes when we put our faith in Jesus Christ. And at the moment of death, we become saints because we have been made holy by our union with Christ.

So, to answer your question, believers become saints through their death and subsequent resurrection into eternal life with God.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response closely aligns with the given answer, emphasizing that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ, rather than their own deeds. It also provides biblical support for this understanding from 1 Corinthians 6:13-14. The explanation of the term "saint" and its connection to being set apart for God's purposes is also well-done.

The concern about clarifying the source of holiness is nicely addressed by emphasizing that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus, rather than their own efforts or deeds. This reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus Christ in the Christian doctrine, as desired.

One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the role of baptism in union with Christ, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 6:13-14. However, overall this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and aligns well with the given answer.
