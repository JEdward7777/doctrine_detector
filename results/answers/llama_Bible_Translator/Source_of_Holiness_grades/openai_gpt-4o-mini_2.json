  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively emphasizes the central role of faith in Jesus Christ in the Christian doctrine by highlighting that believers become saints not through their own deeds, but through their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy. It aligns well with the concern provided, articulating how holiness is sourced from Christ and further reinforcing the importance of faith in the Christian understanding of salvation. The explanation is clear, relevant, and rooted in biblical principles."
