  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and well-articulated explanation of the differences between spiritual authorities and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. The student effectively references relevant scripture passages to support their points and demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinct roles, responsibilities, and spheres of influence of each type of authority. One improvement could be to further emphasize the need for spiritual authorities to align with and prioritize God's will above all else in their leadership and guidance."
