## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to Scripture, demons play a significant role in the deception of idolatry. In 1 Corinthians 10:20-21, it is written:

"Not all who cry 'Ha!' are God's people, and not all who worship me are truly worshiping. I will put no obstacle in the way of those who worship other gods... but the demons do indeed worship them."

This passage suggests that demons are involved in idolatry, and they can deceive humans into thinking that the idols they worship are divine beings worthy of worship.

Additionally, in Revelation 9:20-21, it is written:

"And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, still did not repent of the works of their hands... They did not repent of making the dragon and like beasts give relief from their torment."

This passage implies that demons are involved in creating false idols and deceiving humans into worshiping them.

In other passages, such as Leviticus 17:7 and Deuteronomy 32:17, it is written that idolatry is an abomination to God because it involves worshiping "the host of heaven" (i.e., demons or fallen angels). This suggests that demons are the ones being worshiped through idolatry.

In conclusion, according to Scripture, demons play a significant role in the deception of idolatry. They can deceive humans into thinking that idols they worship are divine beings worthy of worship, and they are involved in creating false idols and deceiving humans into worshiping them.
