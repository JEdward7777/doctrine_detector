  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation supported by relevant Bible verses that show demons' involvement in the deception of idolatry. However, there was a slight deviation from the specific concern of remaining vigilant against spiritual deceit related to idolatry. The student could have emphasized the importance of Christians being aware of demonic influences and staying firm in their faith in God despite the deception of idolatry."
