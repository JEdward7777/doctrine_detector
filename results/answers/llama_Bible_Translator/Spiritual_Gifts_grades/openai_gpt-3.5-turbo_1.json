It emphasizes the importance of unity, purpose, relationality, authenticity, development, and accountability in using spiritual gifts. The only minor improvement would be to further highlight the essential role of love in exercising spiritual gifts, as love is often emphasized in the Bible as the foundation for all spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 13)."
