The student effectively connects Old Testament references to this phrase with its New Testament fulfillment in Jesus Christ, emphasizing the importance of internal transformation and spiritual renewal. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses and the explanation of how Jesus enables believers to experience this spiritual circumcision demonstrate a strong understanding of the theological implications. Great job overall!"
