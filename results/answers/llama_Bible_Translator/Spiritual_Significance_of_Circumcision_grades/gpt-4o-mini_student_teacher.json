  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of \"circumcision of the heart\" in a Christian context, linking it to the Old Testament origins and its fulfillment in Jesus Christ in the New Testament. They effectively convey the spiritual transformation and purification of the heart through faith. The only minor deduction is for slightly deviating from the reference answer in terms of specificity, but overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
