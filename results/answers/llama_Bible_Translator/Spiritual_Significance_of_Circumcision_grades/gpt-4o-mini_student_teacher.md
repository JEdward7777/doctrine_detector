## [Answer](../Spiritual_Significance_of_Circumcision.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In a Christian context, the "circumcision of the heart" (Deuteronomy 10:16; Deuteronomy 30:6) is an Old Testament concept that finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ. It refers to spiritual circumcision or conversion, rather than physical circumcision.

In the Old Testament, physical circumcision was a sign of God's covenant with His people, Israel (Genesis 17:11-14). However, as we see in Deuteronomy 10:16 and 30:6, God desires not just external conformity but internal transformation. He wants His people to have "a heart fully committed to Him" (Deuteronomy 6:5), which is symbolized by a circumcision of the heart.

This phrase is often linked with the idea of having one's "heart circumcised" or purified, free from the hardness and rebellion that characterizes unregenerate humanity. It represents a turning away from self-centeredness and towards God-centeredness, as described in Ezekiel 36:26-27: "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh."

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is seen as the one who brings about this spiritual circumcision. Through His death and resurrection, He makes it possible for people to have their hearts transformed by the Holy Spirit (Romans 2:29-30; Colossians 2:11). As believers are united to Christ through faith, they experience a new heart, which is characterized by love, obedience, and devotion to God (Ezekiel 36:26).

In summary, the "circumcision of the heart" in a Christian context represents the spiritual transformation that takes place when one turns away from self-centeredness and towards God-centeredness through faith in Jesus Christ. It symbolizes the internal renewal that comes from having one's heart purified by the Holy Spirit, making it possible for believers to love and obey God with all their hearts, souls, and minds (Mark 12:30).
