It addresses the concern by clearly explaining the spiritual implications of physical practices in modern Christianity, showing how the Old Testament practice of physical circumcision is fulfilled and surpassed in Christ. In addition, the response is well-supported by Biblical references and provides a comprehensive explanation of the topic."
