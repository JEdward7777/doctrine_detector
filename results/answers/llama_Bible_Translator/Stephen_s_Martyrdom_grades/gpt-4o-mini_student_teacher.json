  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the significance of the stoning of Stephen in the early Christian church. They effectively connected the event to the increasing persecution faced by believers, their unwavering commitment to faith, and the divine plan unfolding through suffering. However, the response could have been more focused on the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution, in line with the specified concern. Additionally, the student could have provided more direct references to biblical passages and teachings to strengthen their argument from a Christian worldview perspective. Nonetheless, the overall analysis was well-reasoned and well-supported."
