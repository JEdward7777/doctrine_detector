The connection to the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution is effectively discussed, demonstrating a strong understanding of the Christian worldview. The response could have further elaborated on how Stephen's martyrdom serves as a model for believers today to remain faithful in the midst of trials. Overall, an excellent evaluation with a solid foundation in Christian teachings."
