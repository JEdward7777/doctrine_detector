It effectively addresses the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution, connecting it to the example of Stephen's martyrdom. The response could further strengthen its Christian worldview by emphasizing how Stephen's willingness to endure persecution mirrors the sacrificial love of Jesus Christ and the call for believers to take up their cross and follow Him."
