  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The answer provides a decent overview of the practice of stoning for adultery in the Hebrew Scriptures and attempts to balance the ideas of justice and mercy. However, the explanation lacks depth in addressing the theological significance of stoning within the context of God's holiness and righteousness. The mention of Jesus' teachings on mercy and grace is appropriate but could be further developed to show a clearer connection to the fulfillment of the law in Christ. The student's response could benefit from a more robust theological analysis grounded in the nature of sin, God's justice, and the atoning work of Jesus."
