  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the practice of stoning for adultery in the Old Testament, highlighting the balance between God's justice and mercy. They effectively discussed the cultural context and purpose of stoning in ancient Israel, as well as touched on God's mercy and compassion within the laws. However, the student could have further emphasized the transition from the Old Testament practices to Jesus's teachings in the New Testament regarding mercy and forgiveness, as shown in the teacher's reference answer."
