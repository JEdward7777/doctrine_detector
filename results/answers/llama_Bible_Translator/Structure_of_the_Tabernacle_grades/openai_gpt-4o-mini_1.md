## [Answer](../Structure_of_the_Tabernacle.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the biblical account in Exodus 25-27 and Hebrews 9:1-14, the Tabernacle was divided into two main sections: the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place.

The **Holy Place** (or "sanctuary") was the outer section of the Tabernacle. It contained:

* The Menorah (a seven-branched lampstand) with its oil and wicks
* The Table of Shewbread (also known as the Bread table)
* The Altar of Incense

The Holy Place represented God's presence among his people, where they could worship and offer sacrifices.

The **Most Holy Place**, also called the "Holy of Holies" or "Orchestrating the Divine Throne," was the innermost section. It contained:

* The Ark of the Covenant (also known as the Chest)
	+ Inside the Ark: the tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod that budded, and a pot of manna

The Most Holy Place represented God's direct presence among his people, where only the High Priest could enter once a year on Yom Kippur to make atonement for sins.
