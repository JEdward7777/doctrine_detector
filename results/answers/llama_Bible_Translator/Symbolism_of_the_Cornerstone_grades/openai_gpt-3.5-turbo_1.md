# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a rich and powerful metaphor! The cornerstone, as described in Ephesians 2:20 and Isaiah 28:16, is an apt illustration of the relationship between Jesus Christ and his followers.

Firstly, the cornerstone represents the foundation upon which everything else is built. In the same way, Jesus is the foundation of our faith (1 Corinthians 3:11). He is the starting point, the basis, and the anchor that holds all things together. As believers, we are built upon Him, and our very existence depends on His strength and stability.

Secondly, the cornerstone is a vital part of the structure, providing support and balance to the entire edifice. Similarly, Jesus is the vital part of our spiritual lives, supporting us in our struggles and balancing our emotions, thoughts, and actions. Without Him, we would collapse under the weight of our own sinful nature (Romans 3:23).

Thirdly, the cornerstone is often hidden from view, yet its impact is felt throughout the entire structure. Jesus, though unseen by human eyes, works within us, transforming us into His likeness, and empowering us to live lives that honor Him.

Fourthly, the cornerstone is a fixed point, unshakeable and immovable. In the same way, Jesus is the only constant in an ever-changing world. He is our rock (Psalm 71:3), our shelter from the storm (Psalm 91:2), and our North Star that guides us through life's uncertainties.

Lastly, the cornerstone is the point of reference for all else to be built upon. Jesus is the ultimate standard against which all things are measured. As believers, we align ourselves with His teachings, His character, and His will, using Him as our guiding principle in every aspect of life.

In conclusion, the metaphor of the cornerstone beautifully illustrates the vital relationship between Jesus Christ and his followers. He is our foundation, support, transformation, rock, shelter, and standard â€“ all wrapped up in one person, who has given His life to be ours.
