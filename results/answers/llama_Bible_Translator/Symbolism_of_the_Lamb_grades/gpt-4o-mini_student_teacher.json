  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of using lambs for sacrifices in the Bible and how it relates to atonement through various key connections. They demonstrate an understanding of the symbolic nature of the lamb in representing purity, innocence, and the substitutionary principle in the context of sacrifices. Additionally, they effectively tie in the prophetic significance of the lamb sacrifices pointing towards Jesus Christ as the ultimate atonement. The student's response is thorough, well-structured, and aligns well with Christian teachings on atonement and redemption through Christ."
