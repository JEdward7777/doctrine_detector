It delves deeper into the symbolism, connecting it with purity, innocence, substitutionary principle, atonement, and prophetic significance. The connection made with the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the fulfillment of Old Testament sacrificial practices is clearly and effectively explained. The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring the symbolism of the lamb in a Christian worldview context."
