  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of the synagogue beyond its physical building. They have effectively connected the term to biblical and theological contexts, illustrating its broader significance in Christian faith and community. One point for improvement would be to strengthen the doctrinal accuracy and theological depth of the connections made between the synagogue and the Church, ensuring they are firmly grounded in Christian doctrine. Overall, a strong response with room for minor refinement."
