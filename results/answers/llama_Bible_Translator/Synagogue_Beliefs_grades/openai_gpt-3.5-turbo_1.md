What a great question!

In biblical and theological contexts, the term "synagogue" can indeed be understood beyond its literal reference to a physical building where Jewish people gather for prayer, study, and worship. Here are some ways to consider this concept:

1. **Community of believers**: A synagogue represents a community of people who share a common faith, just as the early Christian church was referred to as "the synagogue of Christ" (Acts 9:20). In this sense, the term "synagogue" can describe any group of believers gathering together in Jesus' name.
2. **Place of prayer and study**: The synagogue served as a center for Jewish worship, prayer, and scriptural study (Luke 4:16-21). This aspect of the synagogue can be seen as a symbol of the importance of prayer, Scripture reading, and spiritual growth within Christian communities.
3. **Community of faith and fellowship**: Synagogues were often hubs of community life, where people came together for support, encouragement, and mutual care (Acts 9:29-31). This aspect emphasizes the value of interpersonal relationships and community building in the lives of believers.
4. **Spiritual gathering place**: In a more spiritual sense, the synagogue represents a place where God's people gather to worship, pray, and seek His presence (Matthew 12:9-14). This understanding highlights the importance of seeking God's guidance and presence in one's life.
5. **Typological connection to the Church**: The synagogue serves as a type or foreshadowing of the Church, which is the spiritual gathering place for all believers in Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 10:32-11:1). This understanding recognizes the synagogue as a precursor to the Church and highlights the continuity between Old Testament Israel and the New Testament Church.

In conclusion, the term "synagogue" can be understood beyond its physical reference to represent various aspects of Christian life, including community, prayer, study, fellowship, spiritual growth, and typological connections to the Church.
