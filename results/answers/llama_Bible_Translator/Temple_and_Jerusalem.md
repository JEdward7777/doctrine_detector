## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The association of "Zion" with the Temple Mount in Jerusalem is rooted in biblical history and theology. In the Old Testament, Zion refers to a specific mountain or hill in ancient Jerusalem, which was considered sacred by the Israelites.

In the Hebrew Bible, Zion is first mentioned in Psalm 2:6, where it says, "Ask of me, she who is barren; get her pregnant, watch as children of Godlessness burst forth on her, and then make an offering to her - all nations will come to you, and saying, 'This one was born from Zion!'". Here, Zion likely referred to a specific geographical location, possibly the Jebusite stronghold that King David captured before uniting Israel's tribes (2 Samuel 5:6-9).

In later biblical texts, such as Isaiah 8:18, 28:21, and Micah 4:8-10, Zion is mentioned alongside Jerusalem, often referring to the city itself or its palace. The prophets envisioned a future where God would establish His throne in Zion, symbolizing His presence among His people (Isaiah 2:3; 14:1; Jeremiah 3:17).

The connection between Zion and the Temple Mount becomes clearer when considering the role of King David, who sought to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem. After the Ark's arrival in the city, David wanted to build a temple to house it, but God instead appointed his son Solomon for this task (1 Chronicles 22:14; 28:2-3). The Temple was built on Mount Moriah, also known as the "Mountain of the Lord" (Genesis 22:14), which is now part of the Temple Mount complex.

As the temple became a central hub for worship and sacrificial practices, the term Zion likely came to be associated with this sacred site. This connection is reflected in texts like Psalm 102:19, where the psalmist prays that God would restore His presence among them "in Zion" - likely referring to the temple.

In Jewish tradition, the Temple Mount was often referred to as the "Mountain of Zion", highlighting its association with the city and the divine presence. This connection is also evident in Jesus' ministry, where He frequently went up to the Temple area (e.g., Matthew 21:1-17; Mark 11:15-19) and referred to it as a symbol of God's presence among His people (Matthew 24:23).

In summary, the term Zion came to be associated with the Temple Mount in Jerusalem through its connection to the Ark of the Covenant, King David's aspirations for building a temple, and the subsequent establishment of the Temple itself. The prophets' visions of God's throne in Zion also contributed to this association, which is reflected in Jewish tradition and early Christian writings.
