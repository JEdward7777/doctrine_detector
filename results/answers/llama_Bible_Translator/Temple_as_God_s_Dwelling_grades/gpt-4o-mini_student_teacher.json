  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-organized response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people in both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively highlighted key points regarding the temple as God's dwelling place in both biblical eras and drew insightful connections between the Old Testament temple in Jerusalem and believers in the New Testament being referred to as the 'temple of the Holy Spirit'. The answer displayed a strong grasp of biblical themes and theological concepts, although it could have been slightly more concise in certain sections. Overall, an excellent response with a clear Christian worldview perspective."
