It effectively discusses the significance of the temple as God's dwelling place in both eras, emphasizing the themes of God's presence, covenant relationship, atonement, and believers as temples of the Holy Spirit. The connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate temple and believers as living temples is well articulated. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern raised. Great job!"
