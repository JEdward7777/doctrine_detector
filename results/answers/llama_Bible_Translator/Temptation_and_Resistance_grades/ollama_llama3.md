## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a pivotal moment in human history!

According to Matthew 4:1-11, Mark 1:12-13, and Luke 4:1-13, Jesus was tempted by Satan after His baptism. Here's how He responded:

When Satan came to Him with the first temptation (Matthew 4:3), Jesus replied, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone'" (Deuteronomy 8:3). By quoting Scripture, Jesus demonstrated that He was committed to obeying God's Word and trusting in His provision.

For the second temptation (Matthew 4:6), Satan quoted Psalm 91:11-12, saying, "Since you are God's Son, jump now! For the scriptures say: 'He will order his angels to watch over you, and they will support you with their hands'" (Deuteronomy 6:16). Jesus responded by citing Deuteronomy 6:16 again, saying, "It is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test'." By doing so, Jesus showed that He was committed to obeying God's will and not relying on self-effort or human ingenuity.

In the third temptation (Matthew 4:8-9), Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world. Jesus responded by citing Deuteronomy 6:13, saying, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only'." By doing so, Jesus demonstrated His commitment to worshiping and serving God alone, without being swayed by worldly power or prestige.

Throughout these temptations, Jesus remained focused on His relationship with the Father and committed to fulfilling His divine purpose. He did not rely on human strength or cunning but instead drew upon the power of Scripture and the wisdom of the Almighty.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 95.

This response effectively addresses the concern by providing a biblical example of Jesus' resistance to temptation and highlighting its significance for Christians in their own spiritual struggles. The writer provides specific Scripture references and explanations, demonstrating a good understanding of the biblical account. The response also makes clear connections between Jesus' actions and the principles they illustrate, such as trusting God's provision, obeying His will, and worshiping Him alone.

The only areas where this response could be improved are minor points of clarity or elaboration. For example, it might be helpful to explicitly state how Jesus' resistance to temptation serves as a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. Additionally, the writer could have explored more deeply the implications of Jesus' responses for our own lives and spiritual struggles.

Overall, however, this response is well-written, clear, and effectively communicates the significance of Jesus' resistance to temptation for Christian living.
