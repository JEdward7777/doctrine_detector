It effectively connects the biblical account with the concern of providing a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. The use of relevant Bible verses and explanations demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the significance of Jesus' victory over temptation in terms of His role as the Messiah and Savior."
