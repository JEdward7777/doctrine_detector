# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a pivotal moment in human history!

According to Matthew 4:1-11, Mark 1:12-13, and Luke 4:1-13, Jesus was tempted by Satan after His baptism. Here's how He responded:

When Satan came to Him with the first temptation (Matthew 4:3), Jesus replied, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone'" (Deuteronomy 8:3). By quoting Scripture, Jesus demonstrated that He was committed to obeying God's Word and trusting in His provision.

For the second temptation (Matthew 4:6), Satan quoted Psalm 91:11-12, saying, "Since you are God's Son, jump now! For the scriptures say: 'He will order his angels to watch over you, and they will support you with their hands'" (Deuteronomy 6:16). Jesus responded by citing Deuteronomy 6:16 again, saying, "It is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test'." By doing so, Jesus showed that He was committed to obeying God's will and not relying on self-effort or human ingenuity.

In the third temptation (Matthew 4:8-9), Satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world. Jesus responded by citing Deuteronomy 6:13, saying, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only'." By doing so, Jesus demonstrated His commitment to worshiping and serving God alone, without being swayed by worldly power or prestige.

Throughout these temptations, Jesus remained focused on His relationship with the Father and committed to fulfilling His divine purpose. He did not rely on human strength or cunning but instead drew upon the power of Scripture and the wisdom of the Almighty.

Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of Jesus' resistance to temptation, highlighting His obedience and commitment to God. It effectively connects the biblical account with the concern of providing a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. The use of relevant Bible verses and explanations demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the significance of Jesus' victory over temptation in terms of His role as the Messiah and Savior.
