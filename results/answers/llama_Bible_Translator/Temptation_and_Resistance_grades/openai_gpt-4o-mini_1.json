It accurately presents Jesus as a model for Christians to follow in facing their own spiritual battles against evil. The connection between Jesus' example and its application to Christians is well-articulated. Just a suggestion for improvement would be to include a bit more elaboration on how Christians can practically apply Jesus' approach to resisting temptations in their own lives."
