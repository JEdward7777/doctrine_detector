  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and detailed answer that not only lists several terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in Christian communities but also explains the significance and context behind each term. They have shown a deep understanding of the topic and effectively addressed the concern of understanding the various terms within Christianity related to this sacred practice. The only minor improvement could have been a brief mention of the term 'Last Supper' used in the reference answer, but overall, the student's response is thorough and insightful."
