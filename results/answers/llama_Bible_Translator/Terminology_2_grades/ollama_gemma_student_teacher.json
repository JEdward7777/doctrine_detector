  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the various terms used in Christian communities to refer to the Lord's Supper. They provide clear explanations of the different terms and their significance, including their Scriptural basis and denominational variations. The answer is well-written, concise, and demonstrates a commendable grasp of the subject matter. \n\nHowever, the reference answer provided only includes two terms, \"communion\" and \"Last Supper,\" missing several other significant terms listed in the student's response. This slightly reduces the score. Otherwise, the answer is comprehensive and insightful."
