## [Answer](../Terminology_2.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I'm delighted to explore this question! The Lord's Supper, also known as Holy Communion or Eucharist, is a central act of worship and remembrance in many Christian traditions. While the core meaning and purpose remain consistent across denominations, various terms are used to refer to this sacred meal.

Here are some examples:

1. **Lord's Supper** (Scriptural term): This phrase is found in 1 Corinthians 11:20-34 and refers specifically to the Last Supper Jesus shared with His disciples before His crucifixion.
2. **Holy Communion**: Used by many Protestant denominations, including Lutherans, Methodists, and Presbyterians, this term emphasizes the sacred nature of the meal.
3. **Eucharist** (Greek: εὐχαριστία): This term is often used in liturgical traditions like Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and some Protestant denominations. It's derived from Jesus' words during the Last Supper, when He gave thanks to His Father (Matthew 26:26-30; Mark 14:22-25).
4. **Communion**: A simpler term used by some churches, such as Baptists and Pentecostals, to emphasize the shared meal aspect.
5. **The Breaking of Bread** (1 Corinthians 10:16): This phrase is often used in early Christian communities and emphasizes the bread as a symbol of Christ's body.
6. **The Lord's Table**: Used by some Reformed denominations, this term highlights Jesus' presence at the table and our role as participants.
7. **Mass** (Roman Catholicism): Although this term can be confusing, it specifically refers to the Eucharistic celebration in Roman Catholic tradition.

These terms all point to the same sacred meal, which is a reminder of Christ's sacrifice and an expression of our unity with Him and each other. As Christians, we celebrate the Lord's Supper as a way to honor His memory, express gratitude for His death and resurrection, and partake in the divine fellowship (1 Corinthians 10:16-17).
