  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"diakonos\" and offers alternative terms to describe a deacon-like figure in the New Testament. The answer shows a good understanding of the historical context and biblical references related to the role of a deacon. There is a strong connection made between the original Greek terms and their broader implications in portraying the qualities of service, humility, and obedience. However, to improve the grade, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological significance of each alternative term and its application in the church context. Overall, a solid response with room for further theological exploration."
