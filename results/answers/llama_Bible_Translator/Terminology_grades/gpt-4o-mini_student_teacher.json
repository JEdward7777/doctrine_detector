  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 90.\n\nThe student has shown a good understanding of the various terms used in the New Testament to describe a deacon-like figure and has provided alternative terms such as servant, minister, steward, and helper or assistant, all of which accurately convey the sense of service, humility, and obedience associated with the role of a deacon. While the student's response is comprehensive and well-supported with biblical references, the teacher's reference answer provides more concise and straightforward alternative terms, which could have been included by the student for a more complete response. Nonetheless, the student has demonstrated a strong grasp of the topic and effectively addressed the concern at hand."
