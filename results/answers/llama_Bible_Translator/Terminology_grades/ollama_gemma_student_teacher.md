## [Answer](../Terminology.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, the Greek term "diakonos" (διάκονος) is often translated as "servant" or "minister," and it refers to a specific role in the early Christian church. While we often use the term "deacon" today, it's important to note that this English term wasn't widely used until the Middle Ages.

In the early Christian church, the role of diakonos was characterized by service, humility, and obedience to Christ. Some alternative terms that can be used to describe a deacon-like figure in the New Testament include:

1. Servant (diakonos): This is the most literal translation of the Greek term and emphasizes the role's focus on serving others.
2. Minister (leitourgos): This term, which means "one who performs a service," is used in Philippians 1:1 to describe Timothy as a minister of Christ Jesus.
3. Steward (oikonomos): This term, which refers to the management of God's household, is used in 1 Corinthians 4:2 to describe those who oversee the Lord's assets.
4. Helper or Assistant (antilēpsis): This term emphasizes the role's focus on supporting and assisting others.

While these terms don't exactly match our modern understanding of a deacon's role, they do convey the sense of service, humility, and obedience that characterized the early Christian diakonos.
