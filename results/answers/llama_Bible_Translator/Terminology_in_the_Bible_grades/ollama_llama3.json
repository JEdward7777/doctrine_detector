  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning that recognizing these terms helps in comprehending the context and audience of various Biblical texts, which is correct. However, it does not provide accurate information about the terms themselves. The answer is overly simplistic and incorrect, stating that the terms are \"often used interchangeably\" when, in fact, each term has a distinct meaning and connotation.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more nuanced and accurate information about the different terms and their uses in biblical contexts."
