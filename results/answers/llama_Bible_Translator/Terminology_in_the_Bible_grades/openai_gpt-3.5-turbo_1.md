## [Answer](../Terminology_in_the_Bible.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the three terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people are:

1. Israel: This term typically refers to the physical descendants of Jacob, whom God renamed Israel (Genesis 32:28). It can also include the entire nation of Israelites, from Abraham's time onward.
2. The Jews: This term usually refers specifically to the physical descendants of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and their subsequent kingdoms. In a broader sense, it may refer to any ethnic or cultural group that claims Jewish heritage.
3. The Elect/Chosen Ones/God's People: This phrase emphasizes God's sovereign selection of individuals or groups for salvation and covenant relationship with Himself (Exodus 19:5-6; Matthew 20:16). It can include both physical Israelites and Gentiles who put their faith in Jesus Christ.

These terms are not always interchangeable, as they can have different connotations depending on the context. However, in general, they all refer to those whom God has chosen for a special purpose or relationship with Himself.
