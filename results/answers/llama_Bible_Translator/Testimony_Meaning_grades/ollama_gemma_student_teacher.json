  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of testimony in the Bible, particularly regarding the commandments of God. The response provides well-articulated and relevant examples from Scripture to support the claims made. However, the connection to the specific concern regarding the biblical basis of testimony could have been elaborated further. Additionally, the answer does not address the literal interpretation of \"testimony\" as the tablets of stone, which is referenced in the teacher's answer."
