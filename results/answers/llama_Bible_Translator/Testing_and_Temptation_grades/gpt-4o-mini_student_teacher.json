  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 85.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation differentiating between testing and temptation in a biblical context, referencing specific Greek terms and providing relevant biblical examples. They correctly highlighted the distinctions in the nature of the challenge between testing and temptation, emphasizing the divine initiation of testing and the external nature of temptation. The student also offered practical applications for Christians in responding to both testing and temptation.\n\nWhile the student's response aligned well with the concern provided, they could have further emphasized the fact that God does not tempt individuals (James 1:13), which was highlighted in the reference answer. Strengthening the biblical support for both testing and temptation could have improved the completeness of the response.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic at hand and provided insightful reflections from a Christian worldview."
