  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response thoroughly addresses the concern about differentiating between testing and temptation in a biblical context, providing clear explanations and Scriptural examples to support its claims. The writer's understanding of the nuances of temptation (as an external influence seeking to lead us astray) and testing (as a divine process designed to refine our faith) is sound.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to explicitly tie the distinction between testing and temptation back to the concern about spiritual discernment, perhaps highlighting how recognizing the difference can inform our prayers, decision-making, or responses to difficult circumstances. However, the response already implicitly addresses this concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the nature of challenges we face.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of biblical concepts and a clear writing style, making it an excellent answer to the question!"
