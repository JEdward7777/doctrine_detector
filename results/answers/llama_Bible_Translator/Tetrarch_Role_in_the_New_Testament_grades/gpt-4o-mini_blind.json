However, the response could have been strengthened by including a bit more depth regarding the theological implications of Herod Antipas' actions within the overarching narrative of salvation history as portrayed in the New Testament. The student could have also mentioned the parallels drawn between Herod Antipas and the oppressive rulers of the Old Testament, highlighting the contrast between their flawed leadership and the ultimately redemptive role of Jesus Christ."
