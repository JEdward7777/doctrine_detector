Herod Antipas, also known as "Herod the tetrarch", plays a significant role in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke. Here are some of his notable roles:

1. The one who sought to kill Jesus: Herod Antipas is mentioned in Matthew 2:16-18, where it says that he ordered the massacre of innocent children in Bethlehem, trying to eliminate Jesus as a potential threat to his throne. This event led Mary and Joseph to flee to Egypt.
2. A ruler of Judea during Jesus' birth: Herod Antipas was the Roman-appointed tetrarch (ruler) of Galilee and Perea from 4 BCE until his death in 6 CE. During this time, he ruled over Judea, but his authority was limited to the areas under Roman control.
3. Associated with Pontius Pilate: Herod Antipas is mentioned alongside Pontius Pilate in Luke 23:6-12. When Jesus stood before Pontius Pilate, Herod Antipas was being held captive by the Romans, and Pilate questioned him about Jesus' claims to be the King of the Jews.
4. A rival to John the Baptist: Herod Antipas's relationship with John the Baptist is significant in Mark 6:17-18, where it says that he had John imprisoned and eventually executed because John criticized his marriage to his brother Philip's wife, Herodias.

In summary, Herod Antipas plays a crucial role in the New Testament as the ruler who sought to eliminate Jesus as an infant, associated with Pontius Pilate during Jesus' trial, and involved in the death of John the Baptist.
