  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the Great Commission given by Jesus to His disciples before ascending to heaven. The response effectively breaks down the components of the command and articulates how it relates to the mission of discipleship in spreading the Gospel. The only minor deduction is for including additional contextual explanations beyond the specific command itself, which were not necessary for directly addressing the question."
