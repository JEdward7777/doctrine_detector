## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
Before ascending to heaven, Jesus gave the Great Commission to His disciples in Matthew 28:18-20 (NIV):

"Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.'"

In this command, Jesus instructed His followers to:

1. Go: To leave their familiar surroundings and venture out into the world.
2. Make disciples: To proclaim the Gospel and win people for Christ, teaching them to follow Him.
3. Baptize: To immerse new believers in the name of the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).
4. Teach: To instruct these new followers to obey everything Jesus had commanded His original disciples.

This Great Commission serves as a guiding principle for Christian evangelism and mission work, empowering believers to spread the Good News of Jesus Christ to all nations until the end of the age.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately summarizes the main points of Jesus' command in Matthew 28:18-20, including making disciples, baptizing, and teaching them to obey everything commanded. It also correctly identifies the Great Commission as a guiding principle for Christian evangelism and mission work. However, the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its understanding of the mission of discipleship within the context of the Great Commission. For example, it does not explicitly mention the importance of proclamation of the Gospel or the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers to fulfill this commission. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of the basic elements of Jesus' command and its significance for Christian mission.
