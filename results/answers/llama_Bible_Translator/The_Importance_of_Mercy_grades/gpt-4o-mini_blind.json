  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid and insightful interpretation of James 2:13 and its significance in relation to God's judgment. The student effectively connects the principle of mercy to God's character and the importance of reflecting that mercy in our own lives as followers of Jesus. The explanation is clear, supported by relevant Scriptures, and emphasizes the doctrinal significance of mercy in the Christian faith. Well done!"
