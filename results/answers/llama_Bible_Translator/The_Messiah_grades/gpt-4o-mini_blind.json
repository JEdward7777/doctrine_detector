  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and detailed explanation of how the terms \"Jesus\" and \"Christ\" are related, drawing from both Greek and Hebrew origins. The student accurately highlights the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine, with supportive references to the New Testament. The only area for improvement would be to potentially elaborate further on the significance of Jesus as the Savior of humanity in connection to His role as the anointed one (Christ). Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
