## [Answer](../The_Messiah.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In the New Testament, the terms "Jesus" and "Christ" are closely related and often used together to refer to the same person, who is the Son of God.

"Jesus" (Greek: Ἰησοῦς, Iēsous) is the Greek form of the Hebrew name "Yeshua" (יְהוֹשֻׁעַ), which means "God saves" or "the Lord saves." It is a common Jewish name during the time of Jesus' birth. In the New Testament, "Jesus" is used to refer to Jesus Christ's humanity and earthly ministry.

"Christ," on the other hand, comes from the Greek word "Christos" (Χριστός), which means "anointed one" or "messiah." It is a title that refers to Jesus' divine nature and His role as the Savior of the world. In Hebrew, the equivalent term is "Mashiach" (מָשִׁיחַ).

In the New Testament, Jesus is often referred to as "Jesus Christ" or simply "Christ," emphasizing His dual nature: fully human and fully divine. This title "Christ" is used over 500 times in the New Testament to refer to Jesus' divinity, authority, and salvation.

So, when we say "Jesus Christ," we are referring to the same person who was fully human (Jesus) but also fully divine, anointed by God to be the Savior of humanity (Christ).
