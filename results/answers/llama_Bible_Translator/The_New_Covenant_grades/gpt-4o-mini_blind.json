  "grade_comment": "This response provides a comprehensive and well-explained understanding of what it means for God to write His law on the people's hearts in the context of the New Covenant. The student effectively connects the Old Testament prophecy from Jeremiah with its fulfillment in the New Testament through Jesus Christ. Doctrinally, the explanation aligns well with Christian beliefs regarding the work of the Holy Spirit, spiritual transformation, conscience, love, and obedience. The response is clear, detailed, and scripturally supported.\n\nGrade: 95\n\nComment: This response displays a deep theological understanding and effectively communicates the implications of God writing His law on people's hearts in the New Covenant context. Well done!"
