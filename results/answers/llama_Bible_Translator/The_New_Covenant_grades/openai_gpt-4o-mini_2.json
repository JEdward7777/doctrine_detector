It effectively addresses the concern by explaining the transition from the external law of the Old Testament to the internalized principles of the New Covenant. The analysis is detailed, well-supported with relevant scripture references, and exhibits a strong grasp of the Christian worldview perspective on this theological concept. Overall, an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic."
