  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out and detailed explanation of what it means for believers to be glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. They incorporated relevant Bible verses and theological concepts to support their answer. However, the student's response could have been improved by focusing more directly on the central idea of believers being transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection and sharing in His eternal glory, as per the reference answer provided by the teacher. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and provided insightful reflections from a Christian worldview."
