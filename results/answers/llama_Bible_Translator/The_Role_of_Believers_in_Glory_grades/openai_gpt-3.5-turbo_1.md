What a glorious topic!

In the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Paul and John, being "glorified with Christ" (Romans 8:17; Colossians 3:4; Philippians 3:20-21) refers to the ultimate destiny of believers. It is a central theme that underlies many aspects of Christian theology.

To be glorified with Christ means that as followers of Jesus, we will share in His very own glory (2 Corinthians 7:1). This glory is not just a temporal or earthly manifestation but an eternal and heavenly one. When we are glorified with Christ, we will experience the fullness of His divine nature and essence.

In other words, being glorified with Christ means that our sinful flesh will be transformed into the very likeness of Jesus Christ (Philippians 3:21). Our bodies, which are currently subject to corruption and decay (Romans 8:18-23), will be redeemed and made new, just as His body was resurrected from the dead.

Theologians often refer to this process as "theosis" or "deification," emphasizing our union with God through Christ. In essence, we become one with Him, sharing in His divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). This is not a gradual process but an instantaneous transformation that takes place when believers are raised from the dead and stand before God's throne.

The implications of being glorified with Christ are profound:

1. **No more suffering**: As we share in Christ's glory, our experiences of suffering, pain, and death will be eradicated (Romans 8:17).
2. **Unlimited joy**: We will enter into the fullness of God's presence, experiencing an unending, ecstatic joy that surpasses any human comprehension (1 John 3:2).
3. **Perfection**: Our glorification means we will become like Christ, perfect in every way, with no possibility of sin or imperfection entering our new creation (Philippians 3:21).
4. **Eternal life**: As we are glorified with Christ, we will possess eternal life, unencumbered by the limitations and frailties of this mortal body (John 17:3).

In summary, being glorified with Christ is the ultimate goal of the Christian life. It means sharing in Jesus' divine nature, experiencing the fullness of His glory, and enjoying an eternal, perfect, and joyful existence with Him in heaven.
