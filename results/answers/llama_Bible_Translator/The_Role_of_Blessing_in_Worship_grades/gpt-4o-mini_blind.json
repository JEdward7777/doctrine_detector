  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the relationship between blessing and praising God in Christian theology. The explanation is clear and supported by relevant Scripture references. However, there are a few areas where doctrinal clarity could be improved, such as the interpretation of Psalm 103:1-2. Additionally, a more in-depth analysis of the theological significance of blessing and praising God could enhance the response. Overall, a solid explanation with room for further theological development."
