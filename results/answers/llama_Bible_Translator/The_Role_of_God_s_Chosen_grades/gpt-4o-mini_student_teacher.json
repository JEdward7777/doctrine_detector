  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of how Moses and King David were considered \"chosen ones\" based on God's selection process, emphasizing divine election and sovereignty. The response effectively ties in biblical references and theological concepts. However, the student's answer is too verbose and adds unnecessary details. The reference answer offers a more concise and focused explanation, which could have been emulated to improve clarity and conciseness."
