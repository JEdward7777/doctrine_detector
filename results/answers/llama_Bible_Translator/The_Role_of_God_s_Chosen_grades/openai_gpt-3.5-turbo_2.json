  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response thoroughly explains the biblical narrative of Moses and King David being chosen by God for specific leadership roles, emphasizing the concept of divine election. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting God's sovereignty in appointing leaders and its significance for the Christian community. The answer is well-supported with references to relevant biblical passages and provides a strong Christian worldview perspective on the topic. Great job!"
