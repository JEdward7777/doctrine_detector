What a great question!

The significance of the Twelve Apostles lies in their unique role and commission by Jesus Christ Himself. In Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:13-16, and Acts 1:21-22, we see that Jesus chose twelve men to be His closest followers and entrusted them with a special responsibility.

These twelve were significant for several reasons:

1. Representative role: They represented the new Israel, the people of God, in the sense that they would carry forward the message and mission of Jesus Christ to the world (Matthew 10:5-6).
2. Commissioned by Jesus: The Twelve were chosen by Jesus Himself, which underscores their importance and responsibility. This commissioning was a direct act of God's sovereignty and authority.
3. Authority to heal and cast out demons: Jesus gave His Twelve the authority to perform miracles, including healing the sick and casting out demons (Matthew 10:1, Luke 9:1-2).
4. Sent as apostles: The Greek word "apostolos" (ἀπόστολος) means "messenger" or "sent one." Jesus sent His Twelve as apostles to spread His teachings and establish the early Christian church.
5. Witness to the Resurrection: As eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, the Twelve were uniquely qualified to testify to these events (Acts 1:21-22).
6. Foundation of the Church: The Twelve played a crucial role in establishing the early Christian church, as seen in the book of Acts. They served as leaders, teachers, and missionaries, laying the groundwork for the spread of Christianity.

In summary, the significance of the Twelve Apostles lies in their representative role, commission by Jesus, authority to perform miracles, sent-ness as apostles, witness to the Resurrection, and foundation-laying work in establishing the early Christian church.
