They effectively discussed the representative role, commissioning by Jesus, authority to perform miracles, the concept of being sent as apostles, serving as witnesses to the Resurrection, and their foundational role in establishing the early Christian church. While the answer goes beyond the reference answer by providing additional details and explanations, it effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. Great job!"
