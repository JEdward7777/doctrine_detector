  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer that accurately identified several titles used in the Bible to refer to God as \"Almighty.\" The inclusion of both Hebrew and Greek titles shows a strong understanding of the topic. However, the student should have also included the more direct titles such as \"Almighty God\", \"God Almighty\", \"Lord Almighty\", and \"Lord God Almighty\" as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. This additional information would have further enriched the response and fully addressed the concern of enhancing our understanding of God's character through recognizing these titles."
