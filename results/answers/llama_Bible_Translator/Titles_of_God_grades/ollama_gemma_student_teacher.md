In the Bible, several titles and descriptions are used to refer to God as "almighty." Here are a few examples:

1. **El Shaddai** (Genesis 17:1; 28:3): This Hebrew title means "God Almighty" or "The All-Powerful One." It emphasizes God's power and ability to do great things.

2. **Shaddai** (Numbers 24:16): This title is used to describe God as the mighty, all-powerful one who can do everything.

3. **HaGibbor** (Genesis 31:50; Psalm 89:8): This Hebrew phrase means "The Almighty One" or "The Strong One." It highlights God's incredible strength and power.

4. **Yahweh Shammah** (Ezekiel 48:35): In this Old Testament passage, God is described as the "Lord of Hosts," which can be translated to "The Almighty Lord."

5. **Panemus** (Psalm 76:10; Jeremiah 32:18): This Greek title means "The All-Powerful One." It emphasizes God's omnipotence and ability to do everything.

These titles demonstrate the Bible's emphasis on God's power, strength, and ability to do great things. They remind us that God is not limited by human constraints or weaknesses; He is fully capable of accomplishing His will in the universe.

Remember, these titles are not just empty words â€“ they reflect God's character and actions throughout Scripture.
