## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle as they entered the Promised Land, specifically during the reign of King Solomon (1 Kings 8:1-9). Here's what happened:

After the death of Joshua, the Israelites wandered for a period without a central place of worship. They eventually settled in Canaan and established their own local shrines and altars (Deuteronomy 12:2-4). This period was marked by idolatry, spiritual apostasy, and division among the people.

In response to God's command, King David moved the Ark of the Covenant from its original location at Kiryat Yearim (2 Samuel 6) to Jerusalem, which he had captured from the Jebusites (2 Samuel 5:6-9). However, due to a tragic incident involving Uzzah and the Ark's transportation (2 Samuel 6:1-11), David decided not to use the Tabernacle as before.

Instead, he built an altar and offered sacrifices in Jerusalem, which became the center of worship for the Israelites. This marks the beginning of the period known as the "Kingdom of Judah" (1 Kings 2:3).

The reason for this change is found in 1 Chronicles 22:1-5, where God instructed King David to prepare the site and build a house for the Ark's resting place. However, it was left to his successor, King Solomon, to complete the project.

King Solomon built the Temple (also known as the First Temple) in Jerusalem, which became the new central place of worship for the Israelites (1 Kings 6:1-8:66). The Tabernacle, which had served its purpose as a temporary dwelling-place for God's presence among His people, was no longer needed or used.

In this sense, the Tabernacle ceased to be the central place of worship because God had instructed David to prepare for something new â€“ the Temple, which would serve as a permanent dwelling-place for God's glory and the Israelites' worship.
