The student effectively communicates the significance of King David's role in relocating the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, the building of the Temple by King Solomon, and the theological reasons for the shift from the Tabernacle to the permanent Temple as the central place of worship. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the subject matter within a Christian worldview."
