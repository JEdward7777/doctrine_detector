  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response on translating \"El Shaddai\" based on cultural contexts, which shows good critical thinking skills. However, the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages was not directly addressed. The reference answer is more concise and directly addresses the concern by focusing on the simplicity of translating as 'God Almighty' or 'Shaddai'. The student's response, while informative, could benefit from a clearer emphasis on accuracy and consistency in representing God's name across different languages."
