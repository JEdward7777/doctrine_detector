  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and thoughtful exploration of translating the name \"El Shaddai\" across different cultures and languages, considering cultural sensitivity, contextualization, and clarity. It offers specific examples of translations in various cultural contexts, demonstrating a deep understanding of the concern regarding accurate representation of God's name. The only point deducted is for not directly addressing the suggested answer of translating \"El Shaddai\" as \"God Almighty\" or keeping it as \"Shaddai\" if no existing translation, but overall, the response provides valuable insights and guidance on this topic."
