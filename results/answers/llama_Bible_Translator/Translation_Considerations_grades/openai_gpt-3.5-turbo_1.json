It effectively addresses the concern of ensuring that translations convey the original text's spiritual and cultural importance. However, it could have further elaborated on specific biblical examples where these terms are used and their implications, which would have strengthened the argument even more. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview's perspective on biblical translation and interpretation."
