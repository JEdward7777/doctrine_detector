## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The phrase "image of God" (Hebrew: צֶלֶם אֱלוֹהִים, tzelem Elohim) is a crucial concept in Christian theology, appearing in Genesis 1:26-27 and 9:6. When applied to humans and Jesus, various translations can highlight different aspects of this profound idea.

**For humans:**

1. **Representation**: This translation emphasizes the role of humanity as God's ambassador or representative on earth (Gen 1:26). It underscores our responsibility to reflect God's character and values in our lives.
2. **Reflection**: This term highlights the idea that humans are a reflection of God's glory, just as a mirror reflects light. This translation can help us understand our purpose as creatures made in God's image, to showcase His excellence and beauty.
3. **Copy or Likeness**: These translations convey the idea that humanity is a copy or likeness of God's nature, character, and essence (Gen 9:6). This emphasizes our inherent dignity and value as human beings.

**For Jesus:**

1. **Exact Representation**: In Colossians 1:15, Jesus is referred to as "the exact representation" (or image) of God's being. This translation underscores His divine nature and humanity, highlighting His ability to perfectly represent God's character.
2. **Fullness of the Godhead**: In Colossians 2:9, Jesus is said to be the "fullness of the Godhead bodily." This phrase suggests that Jesus is the ultimate expression of God's nature, essence, and character, making Him the perfect representation of God.

These translations can have significant implications for Christian theology:

1. **Human dignity**: Emphasizing humanity as a representation or reflection of God's glory highlights our inherent value and worth.
2. **Jesus' divinity**: Recognizing Jesus as the exact representation or fullness of God's being underscores His divine nature and role as Savior.
3. **Relationship with God**: Understanding ourselves and Jesus as reflections or representations of God can foster a deeper appreciation for our relationship with Him, encouraging us to reflect His character in our lives.

Ultimately, the significance of these translations lies in their ability to help Christians grasp the profound implications of being created in God's image and experiencing salvation through Jesus Christ.
