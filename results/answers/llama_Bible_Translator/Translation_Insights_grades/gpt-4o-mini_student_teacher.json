  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85. \n\nThe student provides a thorough explanation of the various translations of the phrase \"image of God\" when applied to both humans and Jesus, highlighting the implications of each translation for Christian theology. They also effectively connect these translations to concepts such as human dignity, Jesus' divinity, and our relationship with God. The student's answer demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic and effectively explores the significance of translation in understanding biblical teachings.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could be improved by directly addressing the teacher's specific suggested translations and comparing them to the translations provided by the student. This direct comparison would have further strengthened the analysis and demonstrated a deeper engagement with the teacher's reference answer."
