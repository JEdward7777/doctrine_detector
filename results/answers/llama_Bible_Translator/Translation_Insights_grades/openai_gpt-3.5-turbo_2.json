  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the concept of the \"image of God\" in both human and Jesus contexts, examining different translations and their theological implications. It effectively addresses the concern regarding the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. The response could have been strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references to support the analysis. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
