  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the \"image of God\" in Christian theology, offering detailed translations for both humans and Jesus and exploring their implications. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings and presents a well-structured and insightful analysis. However, to achieve a higher grade, more direct references to specific biblical passages could have been included to strengthen the analysis further."
