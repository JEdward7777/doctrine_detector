## Question [Translation Practices](../../questions/Translation_Practices.md)
Why do many Bible translations use 'LORD' in place of 'Yahweh'?

## Target answer from notes
Many Bible translations use 'LORD' to show respect for God's name due to historical traditions where the Jewish people feared mispronouncing 'Yahweh.'

## Concern to grade by
Clarity in the translation of sacred texts and maintaining reverence for God's name.

## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
This is a great question!

In the original Hebrew text of the Old Testament, God's personal name is written as יהוה (YHWH). This tetragrammaton, as it's called, is considered sacred and set apart by Jews and Christians alike.

The reason many Bible translations use "LORD" (in all capital letters) instead of writing out the full name YHWH is rooted in a combination of historical, linguistic, and theological considerations.

Firstly, when the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, was produced around 250 BC, the translators did not want to profane God's name by pronouncing it. They substituted the word "Kurios" (meaning "Lord") in place of YHWH.

Secondly, in the Jewish tradition, the tetragrammaton YHWH is considered too sacred to be pronounced aloud. The Jews developed a custom of replacing the divine name with alternative titles such as "Adonai" or "HaShem," which means "The Lord" or "The Name." This practice was followed by Jewish scribes and readers, who would write YHWH in Hebrew script but read it as Adonai when reading aloud.

When Christian Bible translators came to render the Old Testament into Greek (the Septuagint) and later into Latin (the Vulgate), they adopted this same convention. They used "Kurios" or "Dominus" (Latin for "Lord") in place of YHWH, reflecting both the Jewish tradition and the theological understanding that God is Lord over all creation.

Today, many Bible translations continue to use "LORD" (in all capital letters) as a way to respect the sacredness of God's name while also conveying His authority and sovereignty. Some modern translations may choose to write out YHWH in certain contexts, such as in academic or scholarly settings, but for the most part, "LORD" remains a widely accepted and reverent substitute.

In conclusion, using "LORD" instead of writing out YHWH is a nod to both Jewish tradition and Christian theology. It acknowledges the sacred nature of God's name while emphasizing His lordship over all creation.
