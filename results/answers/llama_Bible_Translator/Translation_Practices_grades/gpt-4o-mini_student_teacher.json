  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-researched answer that addresses the historical, linguistic, and theological reasons for using \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in Bible translations. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively incorporates both Jewish and Christian perspectives. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to directly tie back the explanation to the concern of clarity in translation and reverence for God's name, as stated in the prompt."
