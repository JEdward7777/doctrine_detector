The explanation aligns with the concern of clarity in translation of sacred texts and maintaining reverence for God's name from a Christian worldview. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the Jewish tradition of substituting YHWH with \"Adonai\" or \"HaShem\" to further emphasize the reverence for God's name in the Hebrew Scriptures."
