  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a strong understanding of the biblical concept of zeal and offers alternative translations that align well with the rich theological implications of the term. The answer effectively links zeal to core Christian principles and presents a well-rounded perspective on the topic. The connections made to various biblical passages further enhance the depth of the response. The only area for improvement would be to provide more direct biblical references for each alternative translation to strengthen the argument."
