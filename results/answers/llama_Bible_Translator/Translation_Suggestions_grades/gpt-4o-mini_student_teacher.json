  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-researched response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical concept of zeal. The alternative translations offered align well with the biblical meaning of \"to be zealous\" by emphasizing intensity, focus on God's glory, and selfless devotion. The student effectively connects these translations to relevant biblical passages and theological themes. However, the student could have referenced the teacher's specific alternative translations ('be strongly diligent,' 'make an intense effort,' or 'be eager in determination') to further strengthen their answer and demonstrate alignment with the given concern. Overall, a solid effort with insightful explanations."
