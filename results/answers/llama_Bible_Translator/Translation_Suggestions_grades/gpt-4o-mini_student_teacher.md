## [Answer](../Translation_Suggestions.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In biblical Greek, the phrase "to be zealous" (Greek: ζηλοῦσθαι, zelousthai) carries a rich connotation that goes beyond our modern understanding of enthusiasm or passion. In the context of Christian theology, it refers to a deeply rooted and intense desire for God's glory, honor, or justice.

Here are some alternative translations that reflect the biblical meaning:

1. To be passionate about: This translation maintains the intensity of the original phrase while conveying a sense of focus on what is truly important (e.g., 2 Corinthians 7:3).
2. To be consumed by: This rendering highlights the all-encompassing nature of zeal, where one's desire for God's glory or justice becomes an overwhelming driving force (e.g., Romans 10:2).
3. To be eager for: This translation conveys a sense of anticipation and longing for something or someone (e.g., Philippians 1:17), which aligns with the biblical concept of zeal.
4. To be devoted to: This rendering emphasizes the selfless nature of Christian zeal, where one's devotion is focused on God's glory rather than personal gain (e.g., John 2:17).
5. To be burning for: This translation uses a metaphorical flame to illustrate the intense desire or passion that drives one to seek God's honor and justice (e.g., Psalm 69:9).

When translating "to be zealous" in biblical contexts, it's essential to consider the broader theological themes at play. Zeal can manifest as:

* A desire for God's glory and honor (Psalm 115:1; Isaiah 58:13)
* A passion for justice and righteousness (Isaiah 1:17; Jeremiah 9:24)
* A longing for spiritual purity and holiness (Romans 7:6; Hebrews 10:26)

By choosing alternative translations that reflect the biblical meaning of "to be zealous," we can better convey the depth of Christian passion and commitment to God's glory.
