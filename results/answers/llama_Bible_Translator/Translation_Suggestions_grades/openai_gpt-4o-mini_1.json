  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of alternative translations for \"to be zealous\" in biblical contexts, explaining the deeper connotations and implications within Christian theology. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith through these translations. The detailed breakdown and examples given demonstrate a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
