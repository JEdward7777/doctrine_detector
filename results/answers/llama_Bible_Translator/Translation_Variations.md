As a Christian Bible translator, I'd like to offer some alternative translations for "covenant faithfulness" that align with Christian theological truth:

1. Loyal obedience: This phrase emphasizes the commitment and loyalty required in maintaining a covenantal relationship with God.
2. Faithful trustworthiness: This translation highlights the reliability and dependability expected from those who are bound by a covenant to God.
3. Steadfast devotion: This phrase conveys the idea of unwavering dedication and commitment to God, as expressed through one's actions and decisions.
4. Unwavering loyalty: Similar to "loyal obedience," this translation underscores the importance of steadfast allegiance in a covenant relationship with God.
5. Commitment to keep: This phrase is based on the Hebrew concept of "keeping" or "guarding" the covenant, emphasizing the responsibility to fulfill one's obligations within that relationship.
6. Reliable commitment: This translation emphasizes the reliability and trustworthiness expected from those who are in a covenant relationship with God.
7. Trustworthy allegiance: This phrase highlights the importance of demonstrating trustworthy behavior in a covenantal relationship, as seen in the faithful servant's actions (2 Chronicles 24:18-22).
8. Covenant loyalty: This translation simply emphasizes the idea of being loyal and committed to the terms and promises outlined in the covenant.
9. Faithful observance: This phrase conveys the idea of fulfilling one's responsibilities within a covenant relationship, as observed through obedience to God's commands.
10. Steadfast commitment: Similar to "steadfast devotion," this translation emphasizes the importance of being committed to a course of action or set of principles, as demonstrated in one's relationships with others and with God.

These alternative translations aim to convey the essence of covenant faithfulness while accurately reflecting Christian theological truth.
