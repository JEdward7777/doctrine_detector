However, while their translations convey important aspects of loyalty, commitment, and trustworthiness, they did not include translations that highlighted the essential component of love within the concept of covenant faithfulness, as referenced in the teacher's answer. Incorporating a few translations emphasizing love would have enhanced the depth of understanding and alignment with Christian theological perspective."
