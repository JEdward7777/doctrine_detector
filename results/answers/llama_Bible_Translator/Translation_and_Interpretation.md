## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In biblical Greek (the original language of many New Testament texts), there are two primary words that can be translated as "Lord": kyrios (κύριος) and despotēs (δεσπότης). While both words mean "lord" or "master," they have distinct connotations depending on the context.

When referring to God, kyrios is used consistently throughout the New Testament. This word emphasizes God's sovereignty, power, and authority. In contexts like Romans 10:13 ("Everyone who calls upon the name of Lord will be saved") or John 20:31 ("But these are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might have life in his name and come to know the one who sent me, even him – kyrios – whom I am sending"), kyrios underscores God's majesty and lordship over all creation.

In contrast, despotēs is used primarily when referring to human lords or masters. For example, in Matthew 10:25 ("It is enough for students of the law that they become students of the law; but it is not for them to be called kyrios by anyone on earth, for one alone will be your Lord, and you are all brothers") or 1 Corinthians 4:1 ("Let a man regard us thus: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God"), despotēs highlights human authority structures.

In some instances, especially in poetic or exalted language, the Greek word adōnai (ἀδώνη) is used to address God. This term connotes reverence, awe, and even worship, as seen in Matthew 22:41 ("Then Jesus said to them, 'The kingdom of heaven is like a man who was about to leave on a journey, but he did not know when he would return. He called in his slaves and gave each one work and assigned tasks to each. And charging the slave whom he had set over all with authority – adōnai – over all his household').

When translating these texts into English, the word "Lord" is commonly used for kyrios, reflecting God's supreme lordship. However, when referring to human lords or masters, a more specific term like "master" or "lord" might be employed to distinguish it from the divine context.

In summary:

* When referring to God: Kyrios (κύριος) emphasizes His sovereignty, power, and authority.
* When referring to human lords or masters: Despotēs (δεσπότης) highlights human authority structures.
* In poetic or exalted language: Adōnai (ἀδώνη) connotes reverence, awe, and worship for God.

May this clarification deepen your understanding of the biblical concept of "Lord"!
