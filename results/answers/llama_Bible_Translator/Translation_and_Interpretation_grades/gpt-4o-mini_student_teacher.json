  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the different Greek words for \"Lord\" and their implications when referring to God versus ordinary people. They have shown a good understanding of the nuances in translation and interpretation of biblical terms. However, they could have emphasized more explicitly the significance of capitalizing \"Lord\" when referring to God, as this distinguishes the divine nature of God from other human authorities."
