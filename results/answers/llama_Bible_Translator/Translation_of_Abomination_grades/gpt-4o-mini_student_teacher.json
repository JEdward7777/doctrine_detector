They offered a range of possible translations while focusing on conveying the moral and spiritual significance of the term. The answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the nuances involved in accurately translating biblical terms to maintain the severity of actions against God's laws. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the divine aspect of the term, highlighting that these practices are not only morally detestable but go against God's very nature. Overall, an excellent response."
