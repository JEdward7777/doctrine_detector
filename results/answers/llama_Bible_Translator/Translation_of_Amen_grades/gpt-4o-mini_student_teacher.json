  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough explanation of various potential translations of the phrase \"Truly, I tell you\" used by Jesus, demonstrating an understanding of the significance within biblical translation and theological context. They have considered different translations such as \"verily,\" \"truly,\" \"amen,\" \"in truth,\" and others, and explained how each conveys the solemnity and truthfulness of Jesus' words.\n\nHowever, the student did not directly address the reference answer provided by the teacher, which suggests translating the phrase as \"'Yes, I tell you sincerely' or 'What I am telling you is true.'\" While their response is comprehensive and well-researched, it lacks a direct comparison or acknowledgment of the teacher's specific translation.\n\nTherefore, deducting a few points for not directly engaging with the reference answer, I would rate the student's answer as an 85."
