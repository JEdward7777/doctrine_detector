  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of the Greek phrase \"amen lego soi\" and its significance in biblical translation. It offers multiple translations and examples, demonstrating an understanding of the phrase's nuances. The writer also acknowledges the importance of considering context and Jesus' intention when translating.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about accurate biblical translation and interpretation. While it mentions the need to balance accuracy with readability and theological nuance, it could have provided more specific guidance on how to ensure accurate translation and interpretation.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest adding more explicit advice on how to achieve accurate translation and interpretation, such as discussing the importance of consulting multiple sources, considering cultural and historical context, and seeking input from experts in biblical studies."
