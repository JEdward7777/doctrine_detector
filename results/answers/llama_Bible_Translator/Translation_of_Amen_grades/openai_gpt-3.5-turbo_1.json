The inclusion of examples, explanations, and the emphasis on understanding Jesus' intention behind using this phrase demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of accurate biblical translation. However, to further strengthen the response, connecting the provided translations to the specific concern of accurate biblical translation and interpretation could have been made more explicit throughout the analysis."
