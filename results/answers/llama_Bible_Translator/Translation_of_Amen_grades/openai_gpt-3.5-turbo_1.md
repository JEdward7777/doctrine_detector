## [Answer](../Translation_of_Amen.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
When considering the Greek phrase "amen lego soi" (ἀμήν λέγω σοί) used by Jesus in phrases like "Truly, I say to you" or "Amen, I say to you," we need to understand its significance within the context of biblical translation and theological understanding. Here are some potential translations:

1. **Verily**: This was a common translation in earlier versions, such as the King James Version (KJV). It conveys a sense of solemnity and emphasizes the importance of what Jesus is saying.

Example: "Verily, I say unto you..." (Matthew 5:22)

2. **Truly**: As you mentioned, this is another popular translation. It implies a straightforward, honest declaration from Jesus, emphasizing the truthfulness of His words.

Example: "Truly, I tell you..." (John 3:3)

3. **Amen** or **Amen, I say to you**: This translation preserves the original phrase's Semitic flavor and emphasis on divine authority. The word "amen" carries a sense of solemn affirmation, which Jesus uses to underscore His words.

Example: "Amen, I say to you..." (Matthew 5:18)

4. **In truth**, **Indeed**, or **I assure you**: These translations convey the idea that what Jesus is saying is authentic and reliable. They emphasize the trustworthiness of His words, much like the original phrase "amen lego soi" (ἀμήν λέγω σοί).

Example: "In truth, I tell you..." (Luke 12:5)

When translating "truly" or "amen," it's essential to consider the context and Jesus' intention. His use of this phrase often serves as an introduction to a profound teaching or a solemn warning, underscoring the importance of what He is about to say.

As a Christian Bible translator, I believe it's crucial to balance accuracy with readability and theological nuance. The choice of translation ultimately depends on the target audience and the intended meaning for contemporary readers.
