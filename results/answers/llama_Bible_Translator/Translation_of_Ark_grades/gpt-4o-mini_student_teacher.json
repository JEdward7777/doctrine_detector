  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of the varying meanings of the term \"ark\" in different biblical contexts and showed understanding of the importance of accurate translation in interpreting scripture, the answer could have been more concise and focused on the specific concern provided. The student could have included a clearer comparison with the reference answer and emphasized the importance of ensuring accurate translation for proper interpretation of scripture. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic but could have been more aligned with the given concern."
