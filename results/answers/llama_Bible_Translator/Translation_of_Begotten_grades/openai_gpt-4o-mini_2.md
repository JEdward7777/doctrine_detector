## [Answer](../Translation_of_Begotten.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In John 3:16, Jesus says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Then, in verse 31, He adds, "The one who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him." Here, Jesus is speaking about spiritual rebirth.

When we understand John 3:16 within its biblical and theological context, we see that being "begotten" or "born again" (John 3:7) means to receive a new nature, a new identity in Christ. This spiritual rebirth is not just a change of behavior or knowledge, but rather a transformation from being controlled by sin's power to being controlled by the Holy Spirit's power.

In this context, "begotten" is often translated from the Greek word "gennao," which means to be born or generated. In spiritual rebirth, we are not just given new life (John 3:7), but we are also adopted as God's children (Romans 8:15-17). This means that we become part of God's family and are granted all the rights and privileges that come with being a child of God.

In spiritual rebirth, our old nature is not just "renewed" or "changed," but it's actually replaced with a new nature. This is why Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come!"

So, when we say that someone is "begotten" or "born again," we mean that they have received a new nature and a new identity in Christ. They are no longer controlled by sin's power but by the Holy Spirit's power, and they are now part of God's family.

I hope this helps clarify the meaning of "begotten" in relation to spiritual rebirth!
