  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 95. \n\nThe student demonstrates a strong understanding of the term \"ekklesia\" and provides thoughtful and accurate suggested translations that reflect the biblical concept of \"church.\" The student also appropriately emphasizes the relational and communal aspects of the church, which is important in a Christian worldview. The inclusion of examples from well-known Bible versions adds credibility to the answer. Overall, this response is comprehensive, well-written, and aligns well with a Christian perspective on the nature of the church. Great job!"
