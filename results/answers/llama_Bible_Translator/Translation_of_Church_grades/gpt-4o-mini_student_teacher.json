  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer that offers a variety of suggested translations for the term 'church' that reflect its inclusive nature. The student also correctly emphasized the importance of conveying the original meaning and avoiding implications of a formal institution or hierarchy. The integration of examples from well-known Bible versions adds depth to the response. The only room for improvement would be to directly address the concern by explicitly ensuring that the translations suggested refer to all believers and not just a specific group. Overall, a commendable effort with a strong Christian worldview perspective."
