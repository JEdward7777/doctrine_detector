It addresses the concern by suggesting translations such as \"assembly\" and \"congregation\" that encompass all believers rather than a specific group. The response also emphasizes the relational and communal aspects of the church, aligning with a Christian worldview that values the unity and diversity of believers in Christ. Well done!"
