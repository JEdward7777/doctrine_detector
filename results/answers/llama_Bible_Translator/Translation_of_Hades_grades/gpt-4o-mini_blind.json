  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the biblical meanings of \"Hades\" and \"Sheol\" and offers reliable translation options with appropriate scriptural references. The student effectively distinguishes between the two terms and highlights their theological implications in both the Old and New Testaments. The answer could be enhanced by further emphasizing the doctrinal understanding of Hades and Sheol within Christian theology and clarifying the distinctions between the intermediate state and the final judgment. Additionally, connecting these concepts to Christ's redemptive work could strengthen the overall theological depth of the response."
