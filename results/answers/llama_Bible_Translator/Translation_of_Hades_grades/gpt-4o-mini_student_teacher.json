  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive overview of the biblical meanings and translations for the terms 'Hades' and 'Sheol', they could have simplified their explanation and focused more on directly addressing the concern of accurate biblical representation in translations for greater understanding among believers. The student did provide some reliable translation options and highlighted important distinctions between the terms, which is commendable. However, they could have been more concise and directly linked their translations to the concern provided. Additionally, the student did not incorporate the reference answer from the teacher, which could have enhanced the accuracy and alignment with the concern given.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the biblical concepts involved but could improve on aligning their response more closely with the concern provided and incorporating the reference answer for a more accurate and focused response."
