  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nThis response demonstrates a high level of accuracy and biblical insight in its explanation of Sheol and Hades, two important Old Testament concepts. The writer provides clear definitions, historical context, and theological nuances that help to convey the complexity of these terms. The recommended translation options are also well-reasoned and grounded in biblical scholarship.\n\nThe only area for improvement is in the potential oversimplification of the distinction between Sheol and Hades. While the response does a good job highlighting their differences, it could be further clarified how these concepts relate to the New Testament understanding of Hell or eternal judgment.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a high level of biblical literacy and a commitment to accurate representation, making it an excellent example for believers seeking to deepen their understanding of Scripture."
