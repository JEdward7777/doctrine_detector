# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I'm happy to provide guidance on translating these important Old Testament concepts.

In the Bible, both "Hades" (Greek: Ἅδης) and "Sheol" (Hebrew: שְׁאוֹל) refer to the place of the dead, but they have distinct connotations. Here are some reliable translation options that respect their biblical meanings:

**Sheol**

In the Hebrew Bible, Sheol is often translated as:

* "Grave" (Genesis 37:35; Job 14:13)
* "Death" (Deuteronomy 32:22; Hosea 13:14)
* "Abode of the Dead" (Psalm 28:3; Proverbs 5:5)

Sheol is depicted as a realm where all living beings go after death, including humans, animals, and even the wicked. It's not necessarily a place of punishment or reward, but rather a neutral location where the deceased await the final judgment.

**Hades**

In the Greek Septuagint (the Old Testament translated into Greek) and the New Testament, Hades is often translated as:

* "Hell" (Matthew 11:23; Luke 16:23)
* "Grave" (Acts 2:31; Revelation 1:18)
* "Place of the Dead" (Acts 2:27)

In Jewish tradition and in the New Testament, Hades is a place where the wicked are punished after death. However, it's important to note that this concept is not necessarily equivalent to the Christian understanding of Hell as a place of eternal torment.

**Key Considerations**

When translating these terms, it's essential to consider their biblical contexts and connotations. For example:

* In Job 14:13, Sheol is mentioned alongside Hades (Ἅδης) in the same verse, highlighting the distinction between the two.
* In Matthew 16:18, Jesus refers to his death as being "handed over to Hades" rather than saying he went to Hell.

By respecting these biblical meanings and contexts, we can provide accurate translations that help readers understand the complexities of these Old Testament concepts in relation to the New Testament.

Recommended translation options:

* For Sheol: Grave, Death, Abode of the Dead
* For Hades: Hell, Grave, Place of the Dead

Remember that the goal is not only to translate accurately but also to convey the theological significance and historical context of these terms.
