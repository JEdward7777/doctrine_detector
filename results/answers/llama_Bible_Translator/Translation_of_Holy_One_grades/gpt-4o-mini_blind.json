  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful answer on how to translate the term \"Holy One\" into different languages while maintaining its theological significance. The suggestions provided show an understanding of the importance of conveying God's holiness and set-apartness accurately in translation. However, it would have been beneficial if the student had discussed any specific considerations or challenges in translating the term into certain languages, as well as a deeper exploration of the theological implications and nuances in different cultural contexts. Overall, a solid effort with room for a bit more depth and analysis."
