  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful answer with various suggestions for translating the term \"Holy One\" into different languages while maintaining its theological significance. They demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of accurately representing the term to preserve its theological implications. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on directly retaining the meaning of holiness, as indicated in the reference answer. Additionally, some suggestions may not fully capture the nuanced theological depth of the term in certain languages. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in precision and theological fidelity."
