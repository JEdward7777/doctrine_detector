## [Answer](../Translation_of_Holy_One.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

The term "Holy One" (Hebrew: קדושים, qadoshim) or "Holy Ones" is a significant expression in Scripture, particularly in Isaiah 43:3 and Hebrews 10:29. In these contexts, it refers to God Himself as the Holy One of Israel or the Holy One of Israelites.

When translating this term into other languages, it's essential to maintain its theological significance and connotation. Here are some suggestions:

1. Keep the literal translation: In many cases, a direct translation of "Holy One" (e.g., French: Sainte Une, Spanish: Santo Uno) can convey the intended meaning.
2. Use equivalent titles for God: Depending on the language and cultural context, you might use alternative titles that are commonly associated with God's holiness, such as:
	* German: Heiliger Eine (Heilige Einigkeit)
	* Italian: Santo Uno
	* Chinese: (zhèng dì yī gè) - "Holy One"
3. Emphasize God's set-apartness: In some cases, you might want to emphasize God's unique character as the Holy One by using phrases that convey separation or distinction, such as:
	* Arabic: منزله القديس (manzil al-qadis) - "The Holy Place"
	* Korean: (yeoseong-i anaseo issna-yo) - "It is God's Holy One"
4. Consider idiomatic expressions: In some languages, there might be idiomatic expressions that convey the idea of God's holiness or separateness. For example:
	* Japanese: (seijū no kami) - "The God of Purity" (note: this expression has nuances beyond just "Holy One")
5. Seek consultation and feedback: When translating sacred texts, it's crucial to seek input from scholars, theologians, and native speakers familiar with the target language and culture.

Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that the translation accurately conveys God's holiness and set-apartness while being understandable and meaningful in the target language.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response does a good job of emphasizing the importance of maintaining the theological implications of the term "Holy One" in translations, which aligns well with the concern provided. The suggestions for translating the term into different languages are also thoughtful and considerate of cultural context.

However, I docked some points because the response could have gone further in explicitly connecting the translation issues to the biblical concept of God's holiness and set-apartness. While the mention of "holiness" is a good start, it could be developed more thoroughly throughout the response. Additionally, some of the suggestions provided are more speculative than others (e.g., #4), which might benefit from more concrete examples or qualifications.

Overall, while this response provides a solid foundation for thinking about translation issues related to "Holy One," it could be strengthened by further development and nuance in its exploration of theological implications.
