It effectively addresses the concern by discussing various translation options and emphasizing the broader theological implications. The inclusion of additional Greek references and the focus on conveying both God's sovereignty and human agency adds depth to the analysis. Overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding of biblical translations related to predestination from a Christian worldview."
