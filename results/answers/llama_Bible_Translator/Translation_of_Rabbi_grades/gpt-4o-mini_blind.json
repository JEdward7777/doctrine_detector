  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the considerations that should be made when translating the term \"Rabbi\" in various languages. They demonstrated a good understanding of the historical, biblical, and cultural aspects involved in translation work. The suggested translations and the emphasis on maintaining accuracy while balancing readability were well-presented. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the unique Christian perspective in relation to translating \"Rabbi,\" specifically how Jesus as Rabbi reveals His role as the ultimate Teacher and authority figure in Christian theology. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the theological implications of translating this term within a Christian worldview would have enhanced the response."
