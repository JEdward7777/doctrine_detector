  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the considerations involved in translating the term \"Rabbi\" within a Christian context, addressing the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The suggested translations and insights into maintaining theological accuracy while being culturally sensitive are well-reasoned and aligned with a Christian worldview. The response could be strengthened by further emphasizing the unique divinity and authority of Jesus as the ultimate Rabbi and Master, which would elevate the grade further."
