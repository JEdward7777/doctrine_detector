  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed response to the question, covering various aspects of translating \"Your Majesty\" into different languages. They have appropriately emphasized the need for respectful tone, cultural adaptability, and provided examples in languages such as French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Arabic, and Hebrew. The inclusion of guiding principles for translation is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the response could have incorporated references to biblical principles related to honoring authority and recognizing the ultimate majesty of God. This additional spiritual aspect could have enhanced the depth of the answer."
