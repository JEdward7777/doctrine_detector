  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student did a commendable job in considering the importance of respectful translations and cultural nuances, their answer seemed to focus more on general translation strategies rather than specific biblical teachings or references. Additionally, the provided translations in different languages were well-researched and explained, showcasing a good understanding of linguistic and cultural considerations. However, the reference answer from the teacher provided a more concise and direct translation suggestion. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a strong grasp of translation principles and cultural sensitivity, but could have tied their response more closely to biblical teachings concerning respect and authority."
