  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a thoughtful approach to translating \"Your Majesty\" into different languages, taking into account both linguistic and cultural nuances. The response acknowledges the importance of considering respect, dignity, and cultural relevance in translation. It also provides specific examples from various languages, which is helpful for understanding the complexities of translation.\n\nThe only area for improvement I would suggest is that the response could benefit from more explicit connection to biblical teachings and their implications for translating titles. While the response does touch on the importance of respect and dignity, it doesn't explicitly connect these values to biblical principles or teachings.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that provides valuable insights into the complexities of translation, but could be further strengthened by incorporating more explicit connections to biblical teachings."
