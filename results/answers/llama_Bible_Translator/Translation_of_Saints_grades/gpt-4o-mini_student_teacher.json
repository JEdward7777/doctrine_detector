  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed and well-informed explanation regarding the translation of the term \"saints,\" they failed to address the concern of using inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The student's suggestions for translations were thorough and appropriate in a general sense, but they did not specifically address the concern raised.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic but missed the opportunity to apply a Christian-specific worldview to address the concern provided."
