It offers appropriate translations such as \"holy ones,\" \"holy people,\" or \"holy believers in Jesus\" that maintain the essence of the term. The concern for using inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus is addressed by offering general and inclusive translations that do not refer to specific Christian groups. The suggestions are well-supported and align with a Christian worldview, making the response comprehensive and thoughtful."
