  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how to translate the term \"saints\" in biblical contexts while addressing the concern of using inclusive language to accurately represent all believers in Jesus without focusing on specific Christian groups. The suggested translations align well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing holiness and faith in Jesus. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention the term \"holy believers in Jesus\" in the context of believers still alive, in addition to the existing recommendations for translation."
