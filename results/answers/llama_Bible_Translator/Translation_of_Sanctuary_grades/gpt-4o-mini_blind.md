## [Answer](../Translation_of_Sanctuary.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
When translating the term "sanctuary" in modern texts, it's essential to consider its rich biblical and theological significance. Here are some guidelines to ensure an accurate translation:

1. Contextual understanding: Recognize that "sanctuary" has different connotations depending on the biblical context. In Old Testament times, the sanctuary referred to the Tabernacle or Temple, where God dwelled among His people (Exodus 25:8-9; Leviticus 16:16). In New Testament times, it often symbolized a place of refuge and protection (Hebrews 13:10-12).
2. Hebrew and Greek nuances: Familiarize yourself with the original languages' meanings:
	* The Hebrew word "miqdash" (מִקְדָשׁ) typically refers to God's dwelling place, while "massekah" (מַשֶׂכֶת) denotes a sacred or holy place.
	* The Greek term "hieron" (ἱερόν) means "sacred" or "holy," and is often used to describe the Temple or a sacred space.
3. Translation considerations:
	* When translating Old Testament texts, use terms like "Tabernacle," "Temple," or "House of God" to convey the idea of God's presence and dwelling place.
	* In New Testament contexts, you might translate "sanctuary" as "place of refuge," "holy place," or simply "sacred space."
	* Avoid translating "sanctuary" as a generic term for any safe or protected area, as this would dilute its biblical significance.
4. Theological accuracy: Be mindful of the theological implications:
	* In Christian theology, Jesus is often referred to as the ultimate Sanctuary (Hebrews 9:11-12; John 1:14), who provides eternal refuge and protection for those who trust in Him.
	* Recognize that the concept of sanctuary is closely tied to God's presence and His relationship with humanity.

By considering these guidelines, you'll be able to translate the term "sanctuary" in modern texts while maintaining its rich biblical and theological significance.
