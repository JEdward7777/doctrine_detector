  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with detailed guidelines on translating the term \"sanctuary\" in modern texts, considering both biblical and theological significance. They demonstrated a solid understanding of the importance of maintaining the original meaning of the term. However, the student could have focused more on the specific concern of ensuring the accurate reflection of the Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a well-researched and informative response."
