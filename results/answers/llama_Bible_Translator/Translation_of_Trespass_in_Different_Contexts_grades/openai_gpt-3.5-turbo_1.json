  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the concept of trespass in 1 Corinthians 8:12 and 2 Corinthians 7:1, emphasizing the importance of understanding it as an interpersonal violation rather than simply a moral transgression. The student effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of accurate translations in aligning church teachings with scriptural integrity and community values. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on how this understanding of trespass aligns with Christian teachings on love, humility, and unity within the body of Christ."
