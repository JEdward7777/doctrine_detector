  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the concept of trespassing in 1 Corinthians 8:12 and 2 Corinthians 7:1, addressing the concern of ensuring alignment with scriptural integrity and community values. The explanation of translating 'trespass' as \"interpersonal violation\" or \"offense\" is insightful and demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian worldview. The response effectively explores the implications of this understanding for Christian living and church community dynamics."
