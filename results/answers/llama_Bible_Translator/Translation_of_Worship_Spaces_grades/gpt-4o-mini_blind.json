  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: \nThis answer provides a thoughtful and well-explained analysis of the phrase \"House of Yahweh\" in a modern context, drawing connections to the Christian faith and community. The student correctly emphasizes the symbolic significance of the phrase and offers valid interpretations that align with Christian teachings. The references to the Church as God's dwelling place and to believers as temples of the Holy Spirit are doctrinally sound and spiritually insightful. However, the student could further strengthen their response by incorporating more scripture references to support their interpretations and by addressing any potential theological implications of equating the Church with the Old Testament Temple. Overall, a solid and thoughtful response."
