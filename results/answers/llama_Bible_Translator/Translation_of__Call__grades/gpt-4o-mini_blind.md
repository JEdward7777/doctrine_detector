## [Answer](../Translation_of__Call_.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In a biblical context, when we encounter the phrase "You must call his name" (e.g., Genesis 4:17; Exodus 3:15), it is often translated as "Name him" or "Call his name." However, there are other possible translations that convey the original meaning and theological significance. Here are some alternative translations:

1. Ascribe this name to him: This translation emphasizes the idea of attributing or assigning a name to someone or something.
2. Give him this name: This rendering highlights the act of giving or bestowing a name, which carries implications for identity, authority, and relationship.
3. Name him thus: This alternative translation conveys the idea of naming according to a specific instruction or pattern (e.g., Genesis 4:17).
4. Let his name be...: This rendering emphasizes the idea that the name is not just a label but has significance and power (e.g., Exodus 3:15, where God's name becomes synonymous with His presence and character).
5. Pronounce his name: This translation highlights the act of speaking or declaring the name, which carries implications for declaration, blessing, or even judgment.

In a biblical context, names often carry theological significance, reflecting an individual's identity, purpose, or relationship with God. When we consider alternative translations of "You must call his name," we are reminded to consider the broader biblical themes and motifs surrounding naming, such as:

* The importance of naming in establishing relationships (Genesis 2:20; Exodus 3:15)
* The connection between names and identity (Genesis 11:4-9; Numbers 6:22-27)
* The power of names to convey God's character or presence (Exodus 3:13-15; Isaiah 7:14)

By considering these alternative translations, we can gain a deeper understanding of the biblical concept of naming and its significance for our faith.
