  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 90. The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation by providing several alternative translations and explaining their theological significance in relation to naming in the Bible. The student also correctly highlighted the importance of names in establishing relationships and conveying identity and God's character. The only improvement could be providing a more concise and focused explanation, as the response tends to be slightly lengthy."
