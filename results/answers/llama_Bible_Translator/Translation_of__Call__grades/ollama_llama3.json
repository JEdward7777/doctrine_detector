  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60%\n\nComment: The response touches upon the concept of translating \"You must call his name\" in a biblical context, but it only offers one alternative translation (\"you must name him\") compared to the original response which presents five alternative translations and provides more depth and breadth on the topic. While the concern is about understanding nuances of biblical language, the response only scratches the surface of this concept. To improve, consider providing more comprehensive explanations and examples that demonstrate a thorough grasp of biblical linguistic nuances."
