  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough comparison between older and modern English Bible versions regarding the usage of \"elect\" and \"chosen ones\" in relation to being selected by God. It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the soteriological implications, focus shift, and tension resolution brought about by these translation differences. The analysis and explanations are clear and well-supported, offering a Christian worldview perspective on understanding biblical texts in light of being chosen by God."
