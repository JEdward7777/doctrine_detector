  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-reasoned explanation for why some churches prefer to use \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in translations. They effectively addressed the concern raised about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting their response to the reference answer provided by the teacher and by incorporating a more explicitly Christian worldview perspective in their analysis."
