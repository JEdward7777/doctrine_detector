  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and articulate response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the historical and theological reasons why some churches prefer to use \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in translations. The student provides a clear and concise explanation of the early Jewish tradition of replacing Yahweh with \"Adonai\" and how this practice was carried over into Christianity. Additionally, the student discusses the influence of the Septuagint and the desire to maintain reverence and awe when referencing God's name. The conclusion is insightful and highlights the importance of considering both historical and theological contexts when translating God's name."
