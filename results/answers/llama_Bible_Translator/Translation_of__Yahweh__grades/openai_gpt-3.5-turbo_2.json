The Christian worldview values preserving the sacredness and reverence associated with the name of God, which aligns with the reasoning presented in the response. However, there could be more emphasis on the theological significance of using the original names of God in Scriptures to accurately reflect the character and identity of God, rather than just focusing on cultural practices. More exploration of this theological aspect would strengthen the response."
