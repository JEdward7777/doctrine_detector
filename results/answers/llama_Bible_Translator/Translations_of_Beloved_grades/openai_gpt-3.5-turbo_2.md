## [Answer](../Translations_of_Beloved.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
When considering the term "beloved" in the context of love, we must remember that it's a deeply personal and intimate concept in Christian theology. The Greek word "agapētos" (ἀγαπητός) or "agapo" (ἀγάπη), which Jesus uses to address Lazarus in John 11:3 and 5, as well as the apostle John in Revelation 21:9, carries significant weight.

In this context, here are some translation suggestions that aim to convey the depth of love:

1. "Dearest": This term conveys a strong sense of affection and intimacy, which is fitting for Jesus' words to those he holds dear.
2. "Most loved one": This phrase emphasizes the recipient's status as someone highly valued and cherished by Jesus.
3. "Honored friend": This translation highlights the deep respect and affection Jesus has for Lazarus and John, positioning them as treasured companions in his mission.
4. "Esteemed": This word choice conveys a sense of high regard and admiration, reflecting Jesus' positive opinion of those he addresses with this term.
5. "Treasured one": This translation emphasizes the idea that Jesus holds these individuals in great esteem, cherishing their presence and importance.

When translating "beloved" in other contexts within Scripture, such as 2 Corinthians 7:3 or Ephesians 5:28-29, we may consider using phrases like:

* "Most precious": This term conveys a sense of high value and cherishedness.
* "Esteemed partner": This translation highlights the mutual respect and admiration in marriage relationships (Eph. 5:28-29).
* "Highly valued": This phrase emphasizes the importance and worth that Jesus places on these individuals or relationships.

Ultimately, as Christian translators, our goal is to convey the original meaning and emotional resonance of the Greek text while maintaining its theological integrity within the context of Christian love.
