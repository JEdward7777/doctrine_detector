## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I must emphasize that the primary source for understanding prophecy in Christianity is the Bible itself. In fact, Jesus said that His teachings would be the means by which people recognize true prophets: "By their fruit you will recognize them" (Matthew 7:20). Here are some key principles from Scripture to help us distinguish between a true prophet of God and a false one:

1. **Alignment with Scripture**: True prophecy aligns with God's written Word, the Bible. False prophecies often contradict or add to Scripture, which is unacceptable to God (Deuteronomy 4:2; Revelation 22:18).
2. **Fruitfulness**: As Jesus said, a true prophet is known by their fruit (Matthew 7:20). Fruitful prophets demonstrate love, kindness, humility, and selflessness in their lives.
3. **Obedience to God's Word**: True prophets obey the commands of God as revealed in Scripture. They do not add or take away from God's Word (Deuteronomy 12:32; Revelation 22:18-19).
4. **The Test of Jesus Christ**: True prophecy is tested by its conformity to Jesus Christ and His teachings. If a prophet's message does not point people to Jesus as the only way to salvation, it may be false (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).
5. **Signs and Wonders Accompanying the Message**: Scripture warns that false prophets will arise with their own signs and wonders (Deuteronomy 13:1-3; Matthew 24:23-27). True prophets, on the other hand, may experience miraculous events but these are not the primary focus.
6. **Humility and Humble Living**: God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6; Proverbs 3:34). A true prophet will be characterized by humility, recognizing that all power belongs to God.
7. **Accountability to Scripture and the Church**: True prophets are accountable to the Bible and the Church (Acts 15:28-29; Galatians 2:9).

To apply these principles, I recommend:

1. Carefully study Scripture to understand God's character, nature, and revelation.
2. Examine a prophet's teachings and actions in light of these principles.
3. Seek wise counsel from trusted spiritual leaders and mature Christians.
4. Pray for discernment and wisdom (Matthew 7:7-8; James 1:5).

Remember that only God can confirm the authenticity of a prophecy. We must be cautious and rely on Scripture as our ultimate authority.
