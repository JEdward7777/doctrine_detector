The emphasis on aligning with Scripture, producing good fruit, obedience to God's Word, pointing to Jesus Christ, humility, accountability, and the importance of discernment through prayer and counsel are all doctrinally sound and biblically supported. The only room for improvement would be to further emphasize the role of the Holy Spirit in discerning prophecy, as ultimately, it is the Spirit who guides believers into all truth (John 16:13)."
