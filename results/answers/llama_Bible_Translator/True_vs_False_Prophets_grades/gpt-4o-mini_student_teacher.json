  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 95.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and well-supported response to the question, incorporating relevant biblical references and principles to distinguish between true and false prophets. They highlighted key aspects such as alignment with Scripture, fruitfulness, obedience to God's Word, adherence to the teachings of Jesus Christ, signs and wonders, humility, and accountability. The student also offered practical recommendations for applying these principles in discerning prophetic voices.\n\nWhile the student's response was thorough and effectively addressed the concern, the teacher's reference answer provided a more concise and direct approach to the question. The student's detailed explanation, while informative, could potentially be seen as slightly overcomplicating the matter. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a deep understanding of biblical principles relevant to discerning true prophets and false prophets, earning a high grade in this evaluation."
