  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive and biblical framework for discerning true prophets from false ones, aligning well with the concern about being able to distinguish between true and false prophetic voices. The seven principles outlined, including alignment with Scripture, fruitfulness, obedience to God's Word, and accountability to Scripture and the Church, are all grounded in biblical teachings and provide a solid foundation for evaluation.\n\nThe response also offers practical application steps, such as carefully studying Scripture, examining a prophet's teachings and actions, seeking wise counsel, and praying for discernment. These steps demonstrate an understanding of the importance of humility and a willingness to seek God's guidance in evaluating prophetic claims.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in providing more specific examples or illustrations from Scripture to support each principle. While the principles themselves are well-articulated, adding concrete biblical evidence would further strengthen the argument and make it more persuasive.\n\nOverall, this response provides a thoughtful and biblical approach to discerning true prophets, making it an excellent answer that aligns well with the concern about distinguishing between true and false prophetic voices."
