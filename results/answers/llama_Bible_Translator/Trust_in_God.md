## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In the biblical perspective, hope is not just a vague longing or wishful thinking, but rather a confident expectation of good things to come based on God's promises and character. Having hope in God means that we trust in His sovereignty, goodness, and power to bring about the desired outcome.

Wishing for something, on the other hand, is often driven by our own desires, fears, or uncertainties. It may be rooted in uncertainty, doubt, or even a lack of faith. Wishes can be fleeting, dependent on circumstances, and often influenced by external factors.

In contrast, hope anchored in God is:

1. Based on His character: We trust that God is good, loving, just, and powerful, which gives us confidence in His ability to bring about the desired outcome.
2. Rooted in His promises: We base our hope on specific promises made by God in Scripture, such as eternal life (John 3:16), deliverance from temptation (1 Corinthians 10:13), or provision for our needs (Philippians 4:19).
3. Confident and expectant: When we have hope in God, we're not just hoping; we're expecting good things to come because of His goodness and faithfulness.
4. Unaffected by circumstances: As believers, our hope is not swayed by external events or circumstances. We can face challenges with confidence, knowing that God is always working for our good (Romans 8:28).

In Hebrews 11:1, we read, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." This passage highlights the connection between hope and faith. When we have hope in God, it's an expression of our trust in His goodness, power, and promises. And that hope can give us the courage to face uncertain circumstances with confidence.

In summary, having hope in God is different from merely wishing for something because it's rooted in His character, promises, and our relationship with Him. It's a confident expectation based on our understanding of who He is and what He has promised.
