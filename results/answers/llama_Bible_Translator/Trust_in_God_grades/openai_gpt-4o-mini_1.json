The biblical perspective on hope is well articulated and supported with scriptural references. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the key distinctions between hope and wishful thinking from a Christian worldview. Great job in connecting the concept of hope with faith and emphasizing the importance of trusting in God's character and promises."
