  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured response that aligns with a biblical worldview. They effectively explained the biblical concept of love (agape) as sacrificial and unconditional, tying it back to God's love for humanity. The student also appropriately differentiated between brotherly love (phileo) and romantic love within the biblical context. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly referencing the given concern about ensuring all forms of love align with God's principles. Additionally, while the student effectively connected the different forms of love to the overall biblical definition, their explanation could have been more concise and direct. Overall, a solid effort showing a good understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective."
