  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 90/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical definition of love and effectively analyzes different forms of love within that context. The student clearly explains the foundational role of unconditional love (agape), differentiates between brotherly love and romantic love, and highlights how both types of love reflect God's love for humanity. The response is well-organized, articulate, and thoughtfully connects the different concepts to the overall biblical worldview."
