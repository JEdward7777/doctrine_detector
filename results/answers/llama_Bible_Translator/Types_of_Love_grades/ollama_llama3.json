  "grade_comment": "I'm happy to help!\n\nBased on the response you provided, I would give it a score of 85.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe response does an excellent job of differentiating between various forms of love in the Bible (agape, phileo, and romantic love). It also effectively shows how these types of love are rooted in God's character and His love for humanity. The explanation is clear, concise, and well-structured.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response could have gone further to explicitly address the concern about ensuring all forms align with a biblical worldview. While the response does mention that romantic love should \"align\" with principles of God's love, it would be strengthened by more explicit examples or explanations demonstrating this alignment.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and effectively communicates the different types of love in the Bible while maintaining a Christian perspective."
