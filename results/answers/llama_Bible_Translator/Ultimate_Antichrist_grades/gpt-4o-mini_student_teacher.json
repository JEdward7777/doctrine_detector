They demonstrate an understanding of the different perspectives within Christian theology. However, the student should have emphasized more strongly the connection between the Beast in Revelation 13 and the ultimate antichrist, which is the key point in addressing the concern of preparing for challenges in faith. It is important for Christians to be aware of this eschatological figure in order to be spiritually prepared for the end times."
