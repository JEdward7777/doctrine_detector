It also acknowledges the importance of being aware of eschatological figures in preparing for challenges in faith. However, the response could have provided a bit more depth in explaining how understanding the Antichrist can specifically help Christians navigate these challenges. Nonetheless, the overall insight and integration of a Christian worldview merit a high grade."
