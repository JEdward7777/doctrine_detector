  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of what it means to be adopted as a child of God according to Ephesians 1:5, highlighting the rich spiritual significance of this concept in the Christian faith. The student effectively tied in relevant biblical examples and passages to support their points and emphasized the undeserved nature of God's adoption of believers. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly referencing the specific concern provided and by incorporating more explicit connections to the given reference answer. Despite these minor shortcomings, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and conveyed it eloquently."
