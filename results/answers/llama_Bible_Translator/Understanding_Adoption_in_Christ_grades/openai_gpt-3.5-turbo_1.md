# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In Ephesians 1:5, the apostle Paul writes that we have been "predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son" and then adds that this was done "in accordance with his pleasure and for the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in Christ Jesus." Then, specifically highlighting our adoption, he says, "In him and through faith in him we have been adopted as children."

To be adopted as a child of God means that we are now seen by God as His very own children. This is a profound and beautiful truth! In the Old Testament, adoption was a process where an Israelite would take in another person as their own son or daughter, often due to their family being unable to have children of their own (e.g., Ruth 1:5). The adopted child became a full-fledged member of the family with all the rights and privileges that came with it.

In a similar manner, when we come to faith in Jesus Christ, God adopts us as His children. We are no longer seen as mere outsiders or foreigners, but as sons and daughters who have been welcomed into His eternal family. This adoption is not based on our works or merits but solely on the undeserved love and mercy of God in Christ.

As adopted children of God, we enjoy many blessings and privileges:

1. **Heirship**: We are co-heirs with Jesus Christ (Romans 8:17), which means we will one day inherit all that God has promised us.
2. **Spiritual rebirth**: Our old self is replaced by a new nature in Christ, making us a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).
3. **Relationship with God**: We are given access to God's throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16), where we can come boldly and without hesitation.
4. **Redemption**: Our adoption is part of the larger plan of redemption, which includes our justification, sanctification, and eventual glorification.

In Ephesians 1:5, Paul emphasizes that this adoption was done "in accordance with his pleasure" â€“ it's not because we deserved it or earned it; rather, God chose to adopt us as His own children because of His great love for us.
