## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible addresses the issue of adultery in several passages, particularly in the Old Testament and the teachings of Jesus Christ.

In the Old Testament, Leviticus 20:10-12 states:

"If a man commits adultery with another man's wife—both the man and the woman are guilty. They must be punished for their adultery, and they will become childless."

Deuteronomy 22:22 says:

"If a man is caught having sexual relations with another man's wife, both the husband and the wife committing adultery must be taken to the city gate and stoned—both of them."

In the New Testament, Jesus teaches that adultery is a serious sin. In Matthew 5:27-28, He says:

"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in their heart. If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for the whole body to be thrown into hell."

The consequences of committing adultery are severe. According to Jesus' teaching, even looking at someone with lustful intentions is a form of adultery in one's heart. This means that the sin of adultery begins long before physical contact occurs.

In terms of punishment, Jesus teaches that those who commit adultery will face judgment and separation from God (Matthew 5:29-30). The Bible also describes the consequences of idolatry, including spiritual adultery, as being thrown into hell (Revelation 17:1).

It's important to note that while the Bible speaks strongly against adultery, it also teaches forgiveness and restoration through Jesus Christ. Those who repent and turn to God can receive forgiveness and a new beginning.

As Christian translators, we must approach these passages with a deep understanding of the cultural context and the timeless truth they convey about the seriousness of sin and the importance of obedience to God's commands.
