  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer an 85.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of the term \"Amen\" in Christian prayer, covering aspects such as confirmation, verification, solemnity, and unity. They demonstrated an understanding of the concept within a Christian context and also referenced relevant biblical teachings on the use of the term. However, the student could have further emphasized the connection between Amen and the communication of agreement or desire for the prayer to be fulfilled, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the response was well-informed and provided a solid explanation, earning a high grade."
