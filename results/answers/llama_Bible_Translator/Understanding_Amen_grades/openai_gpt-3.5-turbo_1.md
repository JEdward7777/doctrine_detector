# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The term "Amen" is a Hebrew word that means "so it is" or "verily." In the context of prayer, particularly in the New Testament, Amen is often used to express solemn agreement, confirmation, or verification.

When used at the end of a prayer, Amen signifies several things:

1. **Confirmation**: It confirms what has been said or asked. The speaker is saying, "What I have prayed or spoken is true, and I confirm it with all my being."
2. **Verification**: Amen verifies that God's will be done as prayed. It's like saying, "I know you can do this, Lord," or "I trust in your sovereignty."
3. **Solemnity**: The use of Amen adds solemnity to the prayer, indicating a sense of gravity and seriousness.
4. **Unity**: In Jewish tradition, Amen was often used to express unity among those praying together. When used at the end of a Christian prayer, it can also reflect this idea of unity with other believers.

In the New Testament, Jesus taught his disciples to use Amen when praying (Matthew 6:14; Mark 11:25). This practice has been passed down through the centuries and is still used today in many Christian traditions.
