  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, drawing from relevant biblical passages and doctrinal teachings. The answer emphasizes God's sovereign choice in salvation, the role of faith in Jesus Christ, and the divine purpose behind this appointment. The connection between predestination and human free will is well articulated. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, with clarity and scriptural support throughout the response. Great work!"
