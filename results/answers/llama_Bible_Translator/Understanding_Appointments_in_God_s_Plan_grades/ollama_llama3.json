The use of scriptural references, such as John 10:28 and Ephesians 1:4, adds depth and authority to the explanation. While the response could be improved by further clarifying the relationship between divine selection and human free will, it overall provides a clear and compelling understanding of this important concept in Christian theology.\n\nThe response receives high marks for its ability to:\n\n* Accurately define the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\"\n* Explain the implications of this concept in relation to salvation\n* Use scriptural references to support its explanation\n\nHowever, it could be improved by further exploring the relationship between divine selection and human free will."
