What a wonderful topic!

In John 10:28, Jesus says, "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of my Father's hand." This phrase "eternal life" is often translated as "appointed to eternal life" in various Bible translations.

To be "appointed to eternal life" means that one has been divinely designated to receive the gift of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. It implies a purposeful and intentional selection by God for an individual to experience spiritual rebirth, new birth, or regeneration (John 3:3-7; Titus 3:5).

This appointment is not based on human merit or works but rather on God's sovereign choice and love. As Ephesians 1:4 states, "He chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love."

In this sense, being "appointed to eternal life" means that one has been predestined by God to share in the ultimate destiny of humanity â€“ to have a personal relationship with Him through Jesus Christ. This appointment is not only about receiving spiritual life but also about having a permanent residence in heaven (John 14:1-3; Philippians 3:20).

It's essential to note that this concept does not contradict human free will or the possibility of people rejecting God's offer of salvation. Rather, it highlights God's initiative and purpose in drawing individuals to Himself through faith in Jesus Christ.

In summary, being "appointed to eternal life" means that one has been divinely chosen by God to receive the gift of spiritual rebirth and ultimately to share in the glory of heaven through faith in Jesus Christ.

Grade: 95

Comment: The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of being "appointed to eternal life" and effectively explains its implications in relation to salvation and God's sovereign will. The use of scriptural references, such as John 10:28 and Ephesians 1:4, adds depth and authority to the explanation. While the response could be improved by further clarifying the relationship between divine selection and human free will, it overall provides a clear and compelling understanding of this important concept in Christian theology.

The response receives high marks for its ability to:

* Accurately define the concept of being "appointed to eternal life"
* Explain the implications of this concept in relation to salvation
* Use scriptural references to support its explanation

However, it could be improved by further exploring the relationship between divine selection and human free will.
