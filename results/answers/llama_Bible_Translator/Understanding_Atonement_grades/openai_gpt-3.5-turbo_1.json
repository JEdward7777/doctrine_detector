It effectively emphasizes the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology, demonstrating a deep understanding and application of biblical passages to support the explanation. The response could be further strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references and explanation of how Jesus' sacrifice impacts believers' daily lives."
