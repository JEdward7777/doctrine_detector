## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In Christianity, we understand that faith (or believing) is not just about accepting certain truths or propositions, but also involves trust and commitment. When we believe in something, we are acknowledging its existence, reality, or truthfulness. For example, we believe in the existence of God as Creator and Savior.

However, when we believe someone, we are placing trust in their character, integrity, and authority. In this sense, believing someone is not just about accepting what they say, but also involves trusting that they have a clear understanding of the truth and are acting in good faith.

In Christian theology, this distinction is crucial. We believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity (John 3:16). This means we acknowledge His divine nature, His teachings, and His sacrificial death on our behalf. We trust that He is who He claims to be â€“ the Messiah, the Lord, and the bridge between God and humanity.

On the other hand, when we believe someone like the Apostle Paul or another biblical author, we are trusting their testimony about Jesus Christ. We accept their account of the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus as accurate and trustworthy. This is not just a matter of accepting their words at face value but also involves recognizing that they were empowered by God to write the inspired Word (2 Timothy 3:16).

In summary, believing in something refers to acknowledging its existence or truthfulness, whereas believing someone involves trusting their character, integrity, and authority. As Christians, we believe in Jesus Christ as our Savior and Lord, but we also believe the apostles and other biblical authors who testified about Him, recognizing that they were empowered by God to write His Word for us.
