  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful explanation from a Christian perspective on the difference between believing in something and believing someone. They effectively tied in key biblical references and highlighted the importance of trust and commitment in Christian faith. However, they could have connected their response more directly to the concern of understanding the nuances of faith in relation to trust in God and others. Overall, a strong and well-articulated answer."
