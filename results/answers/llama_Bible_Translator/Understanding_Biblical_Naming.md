## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
When we read "His name is called John" (Luke 1:63), we're not seeing a literal renaming ceremony, but rather a declaration or revelation of identity. In ancient Jewish culture, names often carried significance and prophetic import. Naming was considered an act of divine ordination.

In the context of biblical naming, "calling someone by a name" means to declare or announce their purpose, character, or destiny. It's not just a renaming, but an unveiling of who this person is meant to be.

For example, when God renamed Abram as Abraham (Genesis 17:5), it wasn't a simple change of name; rather, it was a declaration that Abram had become the father of many nations and the founder of the covenant people. Similarly, when Jacob wrestled with God and received the new name Israel (Genesis 32:28), his identity was transformed from a deceiver to a prince who would inherit the promises.

In John's case, "His name is called John" signifies that he will be a forerunner, a messenger who prepares the way for Jesus Christ. This name declaration connects John to the prophetic tradition and signals his role as a prophet announcing the arrival of the Messiah (Luke 1:76-79).

In biblical naming, we see a beautiful interplay between human identity and divine purpose. When God calls someone by a new name, it's not just a change of label; it's an expression of their true nature and destiny, as ordained by God Himself.

I hope this helps!
