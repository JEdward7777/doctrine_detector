  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a strong understanding of proper biblical interpretation and the significance of names in scripture. They provide a detailed explanation of the cultural and theological context surrounding biblical naming practices, showing how names are linked to identity, purpose, and destiny in the Bible. The student effectively connects this understanding to the specific instance of John's naming in the biblical text, highlighting its prophetic and symbolic significance. The answer is well-reasoned and supported by relevant biblical examples. However, the student could have integrated more directly the reference answer provided by the teacher to strengthen their argument and show a deeper engagement with the question. Overall, a thorough and thoughtful response that showcases a solid grasp of the topic."
