The student effectively highlights the loss of divine blessing for Esau and the righteous inheritance for Jacob. The connection between Esau's actions and his later consequences is well-articulated. However, the response could be enhanced by further elaborating on the overarching themes of God's sovereignty, human choices, and the significance of birthright within the context of Biblical teachings. Additionally, incorporating scriptural references to support the points made would strengthen the argument. Overall, a commendable analysis with room for deeper theological exploration."
