  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of what it means to be considered blameless before God according to biblical references. The student effectively draws from both Old and New Testament passages to support their points and consistently ties the concept of blamelessness to the atoning work of Jesus Christ. The answer is well-structured, doctrinally sound, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological implications of being blameless before God. Great job!"
