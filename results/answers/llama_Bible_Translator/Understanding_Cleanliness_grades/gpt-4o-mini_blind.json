  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and insightful exploration of the biblical concepts of \"clean\" and \"unclean\" and their implications for moral purity. The student effectively connects these Old Testament distinctions to deeper spiritual truths and draws parallels to the need for inner purity emphasized in the New Testament. The inclusion of relevant scripture references enhances the theological depth of the answer. However, a more explicit connection to Christ as the ultimate source of moral purity could strengthen the response even further. Overall, a solid and well-supported analysis."
