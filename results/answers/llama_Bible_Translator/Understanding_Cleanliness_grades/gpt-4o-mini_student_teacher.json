  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 80.\n\nThe student effectively explains the significance of the clean and unclean distinctions in the Old Testament and their implications for moral purity. They provide detailed examples and make connections to God's character and holiness. Additionally, they touch on the shift to inner purity in the New Testament teachings of Jesus.\n\nThe student could improve their response by directly addressing the concern raised, focusing more on the practical application of understanding cleanliness in a spiritual context for believers in their personal and communal lives. The response could benefit from providing specific examples or scenarios where believers can apply this understanding in their daily lives to guide their actions and interactions.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the Biblical concepts but could enhance their response by relating it more closely to the concern provided."
