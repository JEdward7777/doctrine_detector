The inclusion of relevant Old Testament and New Testament references strengthens the argument made. The discussion on the connection between external rituals and inner purity, as taught by Jesus, is insightful and aligns well with a Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding spiritual cleanliness can indeed guide believers in their personal and communal lives. Overall, a well-articulated and comprehensive analysis from a Christian perspective."
