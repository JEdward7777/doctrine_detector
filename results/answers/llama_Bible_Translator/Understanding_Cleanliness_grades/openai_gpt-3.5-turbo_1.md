What a great question!

In the Bible, the concepts of "clean" and "unclean" have a profound impact on our understanding of moral purity. While we may think that these categories are primarily related to physical or ceremonial aspects, they actually point to deeper spiritual realities.

In the Old Testament, the distinction between clean and unclean is largely based on God's instructions for Israel's priests and people (Leviticus 11-15). The "unclean" things were those that were considered abhorrent to God or had the potential to pollute His people. These included:

1. Carnivorous animals with split hooves, such as pigs and rabbits (Leviticus 11:7)
2. Creeping creatures like snakes, lizards, and insects (Leviticus 11:29-30)
3. Birds of prey, like vultures and eagles (Leviticus 11:13-15)
4. Dead animals or their carcasses (Leviticus 11:9-10)
5. Unclean foods, such as shellfish, crustaceans, and certain types of fish (Leviticus 11:9-12)

On the other hand, "clean" things were those that were acceptable to God and could be consumed or used in worship. These included:

1. Herbivorous animals with split hooves, such as cows and deer (Deuteronomy 14:5)
2. Fish with fins and scales, like salmon and trout (Leviticus 11:9-12)
3. Certain types of birds, like doves and pigeons (Leviticus 11:13-15)

The significance of these categories lies in their connection to God's character and His relationship with humanity. In the Old Testament, God is portrayed as a holy God who dwells among His people. As such, He has certain standards for what is acceptable and what is not. The clean/unclean distinction reflects God's desire for Israel to be separate from the surrounding pagan cultures, which often worshiped false gods and engaged in immoral practices.

In terms of moral purity, the clean/unclean categories can be seen as a reflection of the heart. Just as certain foods or animals were considered "clean" because they were created by God to be used for sustenance or worship, so too are those who have been cleansed by faith and obedience to God's commands (see Leviticus 11:44-45; Psalm 19:1).

In contrast, the unclean things represent the sinful nature that we all possess apart from Christ. Just as these creatures were seen as polluting or abhorrent, so too are our own sins and rebellion against God's law.

The New Testament takes this concept further by emphasizing the importance of inner purity (Matthew 5:8; Hebrews 9:14). In Jesus' teaching, the focus shifts from external rituals and foods to the condition of one's heart. He declares that what enters a person's mouth does not defile them, but rather it is what comes out of their mouths that defiles them (Matthew 15:10-11).

In light of this, we can understand moral purity as being rooted in a right relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ. As believers, we are called to seek after the heart of God and to conform our lives to His will.

In conclusion, the Biblical definitions of "clean" and "unclean" provide a rich framework for understanding moral purity. By grasping these concepts, we can better appreciate the depth of God's holiness and His desire for our hearts to be cleansed by faith in Jesus Christ.
