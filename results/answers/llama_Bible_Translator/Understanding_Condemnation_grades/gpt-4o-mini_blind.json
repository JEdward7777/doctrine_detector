  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a good explanation of the verses and demonstrated an understanding of the concept of condemnation in a Christian context. They emphasized the role of sin and its consequences in leading to condemnation, as well as the redemptive work of Jesus Christ in offering salvation. The response could be improved by delving deeper into the doctrinal implications of condemnation and the need for redemption through Christ."
