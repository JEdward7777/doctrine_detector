# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
A wonderful question!

In 1 John 3:20, the apostle John writes, "For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things." Here, John is not speaking about a judicial condemnation, but rather an inner conviction or conscience that may accuse us of sin. He's saying that even if our own hearts condemn us, God is aware of everything we're thinking, feeling, and doing, and He is greater than our own judgments against ourselves.

In Romans 5:16, Paul writes, "And not as the offense, so also it was not by the free gift, that abounded to many; for if by one man's offense death reigned through the one unto many." Here, Paul is discussing the nature of sin and its consequences. He's saying that because of Adam's one act of disobedience (Genesis 3), death became a universal reality that affected all humanity.

In this context, condemnation refers to the state of being under the dominion of sin and death. It's not a specific judgment or punishment, but rather the natural outcome of living outside of God's will. When we disobey God, we are cut off from His life-giving power, and our lives become subject to decay, corruption, and ultimately, physical death.

In both cases, condemnation is not primarily about God actively judging us, but rather about the consequences of sin entering the world through human rebellion. In a broader sense, it speaks to the universal impact of sin on humanity, which leads to spiritual death and separation from God (Ephesians 2:1-3).

In Christian theology, we believe that Jesus Christ came to save us from this condemnation by offering Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. Through faith in Him, we can experience forgiveness, reconciliation with God, and the gift of eternal life (John 3:16-17).

Comment: The response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of condemnation within a Christian worldview, emphasizing the contrast between condemnation as a consequence of sin and grace through Christ's sacrifice. The references to 1 John 3:20, Romans 5:16, and Ephesians 2:1-3 are aptly used to support the explanation. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the pivotal role of Christ in nullifying condemnation for believers.
