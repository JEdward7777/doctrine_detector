  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation based on Biblical teachings and ties them back to the concern about the alignment of words with God's teachings. It effectively uses relevant scripture passages to support the argument that cursing has severe spiritual consequences. The explanation is well-rounded and emphasizes the importance of guarding one's words to reflect Christlikeness. The connection to Christian worldview principles is clear and well-supported. Great job in addressing the concern with a solid foundation in Biblical principles!"
