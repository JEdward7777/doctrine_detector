  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student's answer provides a detailed explanation of the term \"unclean spirit\" in relation to demons as described in Christian teachings. They accurately reference relevant passages from the Gospels and provide a thorough explanation of the nature and characteristics of unclean spirits. The student also effectively connects the term to opposition to God, moral corruption, spiritual darkness, and affliction.\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept within a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern provided. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by directly aligning it more closely with the concise reference answer provided by the teacher."
