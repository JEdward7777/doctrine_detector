  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"unclean spirit\" in Christian teachings, expanding on the nature and characteristics of demons in relation to opposition to God's will, moral corruption, spiritual darkness, and affliction. The response effectively addresses the concern by detailing the biblical theological sense of unclean spirits and their influence on individuals. Great job in presenting a well-rounded perspective from a Christian worldview."
