It effectively addresses the concern by clearly outlining the definition and responsibilities of being a disciple, emphasizing the importance of belief, obedience, and following Jesus' example. The reference to specific Bible verses further strengthens the argument and demonstrates a sound understanding of the Christian perspective on discipleship. Great job!"
