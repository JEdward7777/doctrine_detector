  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding God's judgment and its distinctions from human judgment. They have accurately highlighted the key aspects of God's judgment as portrayed in the Bible. However, there could have been more emphasis on the theological underpinning of God's perfect righteousness and justice as the basis of His judgment, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological reflection."
