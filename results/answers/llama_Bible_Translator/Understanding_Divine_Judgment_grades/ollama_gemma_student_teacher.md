## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible speaks extensively about God's judgment, which is a crucial aspect of Christian theology. According to Scripture, God's judgment is a divine act that will determine the eternal destiny of every individual who has ever lived.

God's judgment is often referred to as the "Day of Judgment" (Matthew 25:31-46; John 5:28-29) or the "Great White Throne Judgment" (Revelation 20:11-15). This event will occur at the end of human history, after Jesus Christ returns and the world is judged.

In contrast to human judgment, which is based on partial knowledge and often influenced by personal biases and emotions, God's judgment is:

1. All-knowing: God has complete knowledge of every individual's thoughts, words, and actions throughout their entire life (Hebrews 4:13).
2. Unbiased: God does not favor one person over another or consider factors like social status, wealth, or physical appearance.
3. Absolute: God's judgment is based on His absolute standards of righteousness, as revealed in the Bible (Matthew 7:21-23; Romans 2:6-11).
4. Just: God's judgment is just and fair, taking into account every individual's response to Jesus Christ's offer of salvation (Romans 3:26).

The Bible teaches that there will be two categories of people at the Day of Judgment:

1. Those who have trusted in Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, receiving eternal life (John 3:36; Romans 6:23).
2. Those who have rejected Jesus Christ, resulting in eternal separation from God (Matthew 25:41-46; Revelation 20:15).

God's judgment is not a process of weighing the good against the bad or considering mitigating circumstances. Rather, it is an evaluation of each individual's response to Jesus Christ and His offer of salvation.

In summary, God's judgment is all-knowing, unbiased, absolute, just, and based on an individual's response to Jesus Christ. It differs from human judgment in its perfect knowledge, fairness, and focus on eternal consequences.
