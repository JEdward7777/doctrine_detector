  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that highlights various aspects of God's divine nature. They effectively connected these attributes to Scripture and presented a detailed understanding of the implications of God's divine nature. However, the student's answer may have gone into more detail than necessary for the question asked, straying slightly from the central focus on the characteristics implied by the term 'divine nature.' Overall, a solid response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
