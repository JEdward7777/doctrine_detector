## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Bible teaches that eternal life is a gift of God's grace, available to all people through faith in Jesus Christ. Here are some key truths about inheriting eternal life:

1. Eternal life is a gift from God (Romans 6:23, John 3:16): The Bible says that eternal life is a free gift from God, given to those who put their trust in Jesus Christ.
2. It's not earned or deserved: No one can earn or deserve eternal life through good works or moral behavior. Instead, it's a sovereign act of God's grace (Ephesians 2:8-9).
3. It's received by faith: Faith is the means by which we receive eternal life. When we put our trust in Jesus Christ and acknowledge Him as Lord and Savior, we're given the gift of eternal life (John 1:12, Ephesians 2:4-5).
4. Eternal life begins now: While the ultimate reality of eternal life is yet to come, it's also a present experience for believers. As Christians, we have the Spirit of God indwelling us, giving us a foretaste of eternity (Romans 8:16-17, 1 Corinthians 2:12).
5. It's inherited through Jesus Christ: Through faith in Jesus, we become children of God and inherit eternal life. Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice, I know them, and they follow me. And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish" (John 10:27-28).
6. Eternal life is a new creation: When we receive eternal life through faith in Jesus, we're given a new spiritual nature, separate from our old sinful nature (2 Corinthians 5:17). This new creation is characterized by a desire to please God and live according to His will.
7. Eternal life is secure: As children of God, we can be confident that our inheritance of eternal life is secure in Jesus Christ. Nothing can separate us from the love of God or take away our inheritance (Romans 8:31-39).

In summary, the Bible teaches that eternal life is a gift of God's grace, received by faith in Jesus Christ, and begins both now and in eternity to come. It's a new creation, secure in Jesus, and available to all who put their trust in Him.
