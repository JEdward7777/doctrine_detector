  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical teachings on inheriting eternal life. It clearly articulates the key concepts of God's grace, faith in Jesus Christ, and the secure nature of the inheritance. However, the answer does not align with the specified concern, which emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's laws alongside faith. This omission weakens the overall argument and does not fully capture the Christian perspective on eternal life."
