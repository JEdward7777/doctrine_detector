  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response thoroughly addresses the concern about understanding how to attain eternal life, providing a comprehensive explanation of the biblical teaching on the subject. The writer accurately presents eternal life as a gift from God's grace, available through faith in Jesus Christ, and highlights the key truths that support this doctrine. The response also effectively applies these truths to everyday Christian living, emphasizing the new creation and security of eternal life in Jesus.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have been even more explicit in refuting the idea that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws (as mentioned in the alternative answer). While the writer does emphasize faith as the means to receive eternal life, a more direct contrast with the opposing view might have strengthened the argument.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides an excellent treatment of the topic and effectively addresses the concern about spiritual assurance."
