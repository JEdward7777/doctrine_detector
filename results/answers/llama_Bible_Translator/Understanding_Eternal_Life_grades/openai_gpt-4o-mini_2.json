  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20 \n\nComment: The provided response is significantly inaccurate and inconsistent with Christian doctrine. The Christian worldview teaches that eternal life is not inherited by obeying God's laws but by God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ. It is essential to rely on the Bible's teachings on eternal life for spiritual assurance, as outlined in the graded response."
