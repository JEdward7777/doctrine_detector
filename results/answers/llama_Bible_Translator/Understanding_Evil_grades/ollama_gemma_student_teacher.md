## [Answer](../Understanding_Evil.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the words "evil" (Hebrew: ra', Greek: ponÄ“ros) and "wickedness" (Hebrew: avon, Greek: kakia) are often used to describe both moral character and behavior. While there is some overlap in their meanings, they do have distinct connotations.

"Evil" typically refers to something that is morally bad or wrong, such as an action or a state of being that is contrary to God's will and character. It can describe both the internal disposition (heart) of a person and their external behavior. For example:

* "The evil in his heart prompted him to do what was right in his own eyes" (Deuteronomy 16:19).
* "Their ways are always evil" (Psalm 14:1).

"Wickedness," on the other hand, often emphasizes the intentional and deliberate nature of someone's sin. It can describe a person's habitual and consistent behavior that is contrary to God's laws and character. Wickedness implies a willful rejection of God's standards and a refusal to repent or change one's ways. For example:

* "The wicked are estranged from the womb" (Psalm 58:3), implying a deep-seated and habitual evil.
* "You have taught children and fools, and those who are wicked in heart" (Isaiah 5:20), highlighting the intentional nature of their wrongdoing.

In summary:

* "Evil" often describes a moral badness or wrongness that can be internal (heart) or external (behavior).
* "Wickedness" typically emphasizes the intentional, deliberate, and habitual nature of someone's sin, implying a willful rejection of God's standards.

This distinction is important for understanding biblical teachings on morality and the nature of sin. It highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance and forgiveness in Jesus Christ.
