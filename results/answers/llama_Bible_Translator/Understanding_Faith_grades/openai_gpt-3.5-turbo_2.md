## [Answer](../Understanding_Faith.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the biblical content, "having faith in Jesus" means to trust and rely on Him as one's Lord and Savior (John 3:16). It is not just a mental acknowledgment of His existence or a sentimental attachment to Him, but rather a deep-seated confidence that He is the only way to salvation, forgiveness, and eternal life.

To have faith in Jesus means to acknowledge and accept His divinity as the Son of God, who came to earth to redeem humanity from sin (John 1:14; Romans 8:3). It also involves trusting in His sacrifice on the cross, which is the payment for our sins (Romans 5:8-9), and relying on His resurrection as proof of His power over sin and death (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).

Having faith in Jesus means to surrender one's life to Him, yielding control to His will, and seeking guidance from His Word, the Bible. It is not just a decision made once, but rather an ongoing process of trusting and relying on Him throughout one's life (Hebrews 11:6).

In essence, "having faith in Jesus" means to put our hope and trust solely in Him, acknowledging that He is the only way to have a personal relationship with God and to experience eternal life.
