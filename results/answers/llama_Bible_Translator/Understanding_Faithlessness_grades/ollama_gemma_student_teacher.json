  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the theological concept of \"faithless\" and its implications for one's relationship with God. The response accurately defines the term and provides relevant examples from Scripture to support the definition. Additionally, the student acknowledges the accountability of faithless individuals and emphasizes the possibility of restoration through repentance. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the connection between faith and moral conduct, as per the specified concern. Including some explicit discussion of how faith influences ethical behavior would strengthen the overall argument."
