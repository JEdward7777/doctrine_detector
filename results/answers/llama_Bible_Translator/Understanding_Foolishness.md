## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, a fool is not simply someone who lacks intelligence or cognitive ability. Rather, biblical fools are individuals who reject wisdom, ignore divine revelation, and refuse to submit to God's will.

Here are some key characteristics of foolishness as described in Scripture:

1. Ignoring divine revelation: Fools often disregard God's words, ignoring His warnings, commands, and promises (Proverbs 1:7; Isaiah 5:20-21).
2. Rejecting wisdom: Biblical fools tend to reject the counsel of wise individuals, refusing to learn from their experiences or take guidance from God's Word (Proverbs 9:12; Isaiah 32:3-4).
3. Disobedience: Fools consistently disobey God's commands, ignoring His authority and disregarding His will (Deuteronomy 28:47-48; Psalm 14:1-3).
4. Lack of understanding: Biblical fools often lack a deep understanding of God's ways, failing to grasp the wisdom and purpose behind His actions (Job 5:13; Psalms 14:1-3).
5. Self-deception: Fools may deceive themselves into thinking they are wise or justifying their sinful behavior (Jeremiah 9:2-3; Hosea 4:1-2).

In contrast, biblical wisdom is described as:

* Seeking God's guidance and counsel (Proverbs 3:5-6)
* Submitting to God's will and authority (Isaiah 26:3; Romans 12:2)
* Being humble and recognizing one's limitations (Psalm 131:1-3; Proverbs 11:2)

As Christians, we are called to seek wisdom from above (James 1:5) and to trust in God's sovereignty and goodness. By doing so, we can avoid the pitfalls of foolishness and live according to God's will, as described in His Word.

In 1 Corinthians 3:18-20, Paul writes:

"Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become 'fools' so that you can be truly wise. For this kind of 'wisdom' is sham. As Scripture says, 'He is a fool to think it can accomplish anything!' But where it says, 'The wisdom of this world is foolishness before God.' Therefore, since God in his wisdom saw fit to unite us all in Christ under the banner of eternal love, he should certainly give us only good as those who belong to him."
