The answer emphasizes the importance of forgiveness as a conscious decision to release negative emotions and trust in God's goodness. The student effectively explains that forgiveness is not about excusing the wrongdoing but choosing to let go of anger and bitterness. The response could be improved by incorporating a more direct reference to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
