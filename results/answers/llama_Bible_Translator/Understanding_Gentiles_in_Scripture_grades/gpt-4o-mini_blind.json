The student effectively references biblical passages and historical context to support their points. The discussion on the transformation of attitudes towards Gentile converts in the early church is well articulated. However, there could be more emphasis on the role of God's grace and Jesus' redemptive work in breaking down the barriers between Jews and Gentiles, which is central to the Christian perspective on this issue. Additionally, a stronger connection to doctrinal teachings on unity and inclusivity in Christ could enhance the doctrinal appropriateness of the response."
