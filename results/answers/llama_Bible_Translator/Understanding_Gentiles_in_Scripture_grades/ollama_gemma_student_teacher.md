What a timely and relevant question!

In the early days of Christianity, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles (non-Jews) played a significant role in shaping the relationships between Jewish Christians and Gentile converts. This perception was rooted in the biblical narratives and the cultural context of ancient Judaism.

In the Old Testament, the concept of "Gentile" referred to anyone who was not from the family of Israel. The Israelites saw themselves as God's chosen people, set apart for a special purpose (Deuteronomy 7:6-8). This sense of being elect led them to view Gentiles as outsiders, often characterized as uncircumcised, unclean, and even enemies of God (Deuteronomy 23:3-4; Psalms 14:1-3).

In the New Testament era, this perception persisted among many Jewish Christians. They saw Gentile converts to Christianity as "dogs" or "unclean" animals, unworthy of association with the people of God (Matthew 15:22-27). This attitude was reinforced by the prevailing Jewish understanding that the Law of Moses was only for Israelites, and that Gentiles were not under its jurisdiction.

As a result, many Jewish Christians were hesitant to interact with or accept Gentile converts into their communities. This segregation was so pronounced that some Christian leaders, such as Peter (Acts 11:1-18), had to confront this issue and challenge the prevailing views. The Jerusalem Council, recorded in Acts 15, marked a significant turning point in this regard.

Through Jesus' teachings and the apostles' experiences, the early church came to understand that God's plan of salvation was not limited to Israel alone (Matthew 28:18-20; John 3:16). Gentile converts were welcomed into the Christian community, and the distinction between Jew and Gentile began to fade.

In Galatians 2:11-14, Paul explicitly addresses this issue, emphasizing that faith in Jesus Christ is what makes a person righteous before God, not their ethnicity or cultural background. He also highlights the importance of unity among believers, regardless of their origins (Galatians 3:28).

In summary, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles as outsiders and enemies of God was a significant factor in shaping relationships between Jewish Christians and Gentile converts in the early church. However, through Jesus' teachings and the apostles' experiences, this view began to change, leading to greater unity and inclusivity among believers from diverse backgrounds.
