# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
When the Bible says that God has "called" us by name, it's not meant to be taken literally as if God has a phone book or a Rolodex with our names in it! Instead, this phrase is rooted in ancient Near Eastern culture and language. In biblical Hebrew, the verb "to call" (qara') carries connotations of summons, invitation, or designation.

When God "calls" us by name, it means He has individually addressed each person, recognizing their unique identity and purpose. This concept is closely tied to the idea of election, where God chooses individuals for a specific mission or role within His plan.

In Psalm 139:13-16, we read that God knew us before we were born and formed us in our mother's womb. This implies that He has a personal relationship with each person, even from conception. When God "calls" us by name, it means He has been aware of our existence, thought about us, and intended for us to play a specific part in His larger story.

This concept is also seen in Jeremiah 1:5, where God says, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you were born, I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations." Here, God's knowing and calling precede our physical existence. This understanding emphasizes God's sovereignty and His knowledge of each individual.

In this sense, when God calls us by name, it's not just about recognition or acknowledgment but also about commissioning and empowering us for service. It's an invitation to partner with Him in His grand narrative, which is often referred to as the "greater story" (Acts 13:2-3; Matthew 4:18-22).

As Christians, we can take comfort in knowing that God has a personal stake in our lives and has called us by name for a specific purpose. This understanding should inspire us to live out our faith with intentionality, confidence, and humility, as we seek to fulfill the mission He has given us.

Grade: 95

Comment: The response provides a thorough and insightful explanation of the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals based on biblical references and theological understanding. The incorporation of scriptural examples and the emphasis on God's sovereignty and knowledge of each individual demonstrate a solid Christian worldview perspective. The only room for improvement would be to perhaps further elaborate on the transformative impact of God's calling on individuals' lives, but overall, this response aligns well with a Christian perspective on God's personal relationship with His creation.
