  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and thoughtful explanation of the significance of the title \"Most High\" in relation to God's authority. They have effectively highlighted key theological concepts such as God's sovereignty, transcendence, omniscience, and omnipotence. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the Biblical teachings on God's authority and provides practical implications for believers. The only room for improvement would be to possibly include more scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
