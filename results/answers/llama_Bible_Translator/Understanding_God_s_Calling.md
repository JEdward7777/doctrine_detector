In Christian theology, being "called" by God refers to the unique and individual invitation from God to follow Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. This concept is rooted in Scripture, particularly in the New Testament.

When we say that someone is "called" by God, it means that God has singled them out for a specific purpose or ministry. This calling is not just a general invitation to accept Jesus as one's savior, but rather a personal and particular summons to serve God in a unique way.

In the Bible, we see examples of people who were called by God for specific purposes:

* Moses was called to lead Israel out of slavery (Exodus 3:4-15).
* Isaiah was called to proclaim God's message to Judah (Isaiah 6:1-13).
* Paul was called to be an apostle to the Gentiles (Acts 9:1-31, Galatians 1:11-12).

In modern Christian theology, being "called" by God often refers to a sense of vocational discernment. It's the process of seeking and listening for God's guidance regarding one's life direction, whether that's in vocation, relationships, or spiritual growth.

For Christians, being called by God is closely tied to salvation. In Jesus' words, "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit" (John 15:16). This calling is a reflection of our identity as children of God, and it's an essential part of living out our faith in practical ways.

Some key aspects of being called by God include:

1. Uniqueness: Each person has a unique calling that reflects their gifts, talents, and experiences.
2. Purpose: The call of God is not just about personal fulfillment but also about serving others for His glory.
3. Direction: Being called by God involves seeking and following His guidance in life's decisions and choices.
4. Obedience: Responding to one's calling requires obedience to God's will, even when it's difficult or uncertain.

Ultimately, being "called" by God is a sacred experience that shapes our lives and ministries as we seek to honor Him and fulfill our purpose on earth.
