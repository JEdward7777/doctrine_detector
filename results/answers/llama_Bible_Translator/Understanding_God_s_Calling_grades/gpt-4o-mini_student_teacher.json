  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated answer to the question, integrating biblical examples and modern theological concepts. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith by highlighting the uniqueness, purpose, direction, and obedience involved in being called by God. There is a strong connection to Christian beliefs and scriptural references. However, the answer could have been improved by more directly reflecting the succinct reference answer given by the teacher."
