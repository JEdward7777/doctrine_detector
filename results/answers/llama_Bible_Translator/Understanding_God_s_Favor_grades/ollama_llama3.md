What a great question!

According to the Bible, Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and men in several ways:

**Favor with God:**

1. **Obedience**: Jesus was obedient to God's will, even unto death (John 10:18; Hebrews 5:8). He lived a life of perfect obedience to His Father, demonstrating trust in God's plans.
2. **Compliance with Scripture**: Jesus fulfilled the Law and the Prophets, doing everything that was written about Him (Matthew 5:17-20; Luke 24:44).
3. **Intimate relationship with God**: Jesus had a deep, intimate relationship with His Father, praying in secret and seeking guidance from Him (Matthew 6:6; John 5:30).

**Favor with men:**

1. **Compassion and love**: Jesus showed compassion to those who were hurting, touching the lepers, the blind, and the outcasts (Matthew 8:3; Mark 7:32).
2. **Mercy and forgiveness**: He showed mercy and forgiveness to sinners, often eating with them and sharing meals together (Mark 2:15-17; Luke 19:1-10).
3. **Teaching and proclaiming the truth**: Jesus taught about God's love, salvation, and the kingdom of heaven, proclaiming the Good News to all who would listen (Matthew 4:23; Mark 1:38).

**The ultimate demonstration of favor:**

Jesus' greatest demonstration of favor with both God and men was His death on the cross. This act of self-sacrificial love reconciled humanity to God, offering forgiveness and eternal life to all who believe in Him (John 3:16-17; Romans 5:6-8).

May we strive to follow Jesus' example, demonstrating favor with both God and our fellow humans as we live out our faith.

Grade: 95

The response provides a thorough explanation of Jesus' favor with both God and men, highlighting specific examples from Scripture that demonstrate His obedience, compliance with Scripture, intimate relationship with God, compassion, mercy, forgiveness, teaching, and proclaiming of the truth. The ultimate demonstration of His favor is His death on the cross, which reconciled humanity to God.

The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of emulating Jesus' qualities, such as obedience, compassion, and self-sacrificial love, in order to demonstrate favor with both God and others. The author encourages readers to "strive to follow Jesus' example" and live out their faith in a way that is pleasing to God and beneficial to those around them.

The only area for improvement would be to provide more explicit connections between Jesus' qualities and behaviors, and how these can be applied in everyday life as Christians strive to emulate His example. Nevertheless, the response provides a strong foundation for understanding and applying Jesus' teachings on favor with both God and others.
