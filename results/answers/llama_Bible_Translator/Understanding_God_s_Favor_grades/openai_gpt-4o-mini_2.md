What a great question!

According to the Bible, Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and men in several ways:

**Favor with God:**

1. **Obedience**: Jesus was obedient to God's will, even unto death (John 10:18; Hebrews 5:8). He lived a life of perfect obedience to His Father, demonstrating trust in God's plans.
2. **Compliance with Scripture**: Jesus fulfilled the Law and the Prophets, doing everything that was written about Him (Matthew 5:17-20; Luke 24:44).
3. **Intimate relationship with God**: Jesus had a deep, intimate relationship with His Father, praying in secret and seeking guidance from Him (Matthew 6:6; John 5:30).

**Favor with men:**

1. **Compassion and love**: Jesus showed compassion to those who were hurting, touching the lepers, the blind, and the outcasts (Matthew 8:3; Mark 7:32).
2. **Mercy and forgiveness**: He showed mercy and forgiveness to sinners, often eating with them and sharing meals together (Mark 2:15-17; Luke 19:1-10).
3. **Teaching and proclaiming the truth**: Jesus taught about God's love, salvation, and the kingdom of heaven, proclaiming the Good News to all who would listen (Matthew 4:23; Mark 1:38).

**The ultimate demonstration of favor:**

Jesus' greatest demonstration of favor with both God and men was His death on the cross. This act of self-sacrificial love reconciled humanity to God, offering forgiveness and eternal life to all who believe in Him (John 3:16-17; Romans 5:6-8).

May we strive to follow Jesus' example, demonstrating favor with both God and our fellow humans as we live out our faith.
