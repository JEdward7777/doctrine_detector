What a fantastic question!

In the Bible, God's glory (Hebrew: כָּבוֹד, kabod) is a profound and multifaceted concept that stands in stark contrast to worldly sources of glory. Here are some key differences:

1. **Source**: Biblical glory originates from God Himself, being an attribute of His divine nature (Isaiah 40:5). In contrast, worldly glory often comes from human achievements, possessions, or accomplishments.
2. **Purpose**: The Bible says that God's glory is the ultimate goal and purpose of creation (Psalm 19:1-6; Ephesians 1:12). This means that everything exists to bring honor and praise to God. In contrast, worldly sources of glory often seek to elevate or aggrandize humanity.
3. **Nature**: Biblical glory is not a fleeting, external recognition but an intrinsic quality of God's character (Exodus 33:18-23; Isaiah 60:1-3). It's the radiance and majesty that emanate from His very being. Worldly glory, on the other hand, is often tied to human achievements, reputation, or status.
4. **Duration**: Biblical glory is eternal and unchanging (Psalm 102:24-25; Isaiah 40:28). It's not subject to the whims of human opinion or fleeting circumstances. In contrast, worldly sources of glory are temporal and can be lost in an instant.
5. **Characteristics**: God's glory is characterized by righteousness, justice, and mercy (Psalm 99:3-4; Isaiah 61:1-2). It's a glory that brings redemption, forgiveness, and new life to humanity. Worldly sources of glory often prioritize power, prestige, or material wealth.
6. **Instruments**: The Bible says that God's glory is revealed through His works, such as creation (Psalm 19:1), the tabernacle (Exodus 25:8-9), and ultimately, Jesus Christ Himself (John 1:14). In contrast, worldly sources of glory often rely on human achievements, media coverage, or public opinion.
7. **Response**: When we encounter God's glory in the Bible, our response is expected to be one of humility, reverence, and worship (Psalm 99:5; Isaiah 6:1-5). We're called to magnify His name and celebrate His greatness (Isaiah 42:8). In contrast, worldly sources of glory often elicit pride, self-promotion, or a desire for more.

In conclusion, the concept of God's glory in the Bible is fundamentally different from worldly sources of glory. While the latter may be fleeting, external, and tied to human achievements, God's glory is eternal, intrinsic, and reveals His righteous character. As believers, we're called to seek and magnify this divine glory above all else.
