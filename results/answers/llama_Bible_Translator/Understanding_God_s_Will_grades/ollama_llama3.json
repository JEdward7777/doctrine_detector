  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the concept of seeking God's will in everyday decisions, providing a comprehensive understanding of what it entails. The author has woven together various biblical passages to support their claims, demonstrating a strong grasp of Scripture. The response also acknowledges the importance of faith, trust, and obedience in seeking God's guidance.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is in its clarity and concision. Some of the points made are repeated or rephrased throughout the text, which makes it slightly verbose. Additionally, some of the sentences are quite long and complex, which may make them difficult to follow for readers who are new to Christian theology.\n\nOverall, however, this response is well-written, thoughtful, and deeply rooted in Scripture. It effectively addresses the concern about people struggling with making decisions that honor God or feeling uncertain about His direction for their lives."
