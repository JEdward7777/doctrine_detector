  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and well-explained comparison between God's wrath and human anger, highlighting key biblical references to support their points. They effectively emphasize the righteous nature of God's wrath and the sinful nature of human anger, while also drawing meaningful distinctions in terms of motivation, timing, consequences, and expression. The student's response aligns well with the biblical understanding of God's wrath as a just response to sin, while also cautioning against the sinful aspects of human anger. Well done!"
