  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response accurately explains God's wrath as a righteous judgment of sin, in contrast to human anger which can be sinful. It also highlights the importance of understanding that God's wrath is not a fit of rage but a measured response to sin. The response provides clear biblical examples and explanations to support its claims.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have delved deeper into the consequences of rejecting God's wrath, as the concern suggested. However, overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical teachings on God's wrath and human anger, and it provides a clear and concise explanation of these concepts.\n\nComment: This response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing that God's wrath is not an emotional response but rather a measured judgment against sin. The writer also does an excellent job of highlighting the distinct nature of God's wrath compared to human anger, providing biblical support for their claims."
