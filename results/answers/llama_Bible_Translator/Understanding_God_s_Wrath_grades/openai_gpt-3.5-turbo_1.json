It emphasizes the measured and righteous nature of God's wrath in contrast to human anger, aligning well with the concern raised about the misconception of God's wrath being a fit of rage. The biblical references and comparisons made effectively highlight the differences between the two concepts, showcasing a deep understanding of Christian theology."
