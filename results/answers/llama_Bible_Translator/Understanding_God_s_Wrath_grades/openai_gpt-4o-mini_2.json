  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation differentiating between God's wrath and human anger, emphasizing the measured and righteous nature of God's wrath compared to the more sinful and impulsive nature of human anger. The response aligns well with the concern raised about God's wrath being a measured response rather than a fit of rage. Additionally, it incorporates relevant biblical references and highlights key distinctions between the two emotions from a Christian worldview perspective."
