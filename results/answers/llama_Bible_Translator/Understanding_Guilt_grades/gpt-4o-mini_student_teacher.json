  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of what it means to be guilty according to the Bible. They effectively convey the spiritual and moral implications of guilt, referencing relevant Bible verses to support their points. The response effectively emphasizes the need for repentance and forgiveness in light of our guilt before a holy God. While the student's answer extends beyond the reference answer, the additional insights and scriptural references enhance the depth of the explanation, aligning well with a Christian worldview. Great job overall."
