## [Answer](../Understanding_Guilt.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Bible, being guilty refers to the state of having broken God's laws and standards, resulting in a moral debt or sin that separates us from Him.

In the biblical context, guilt is not just a feeling or an emotional state, but rather a concrete reality that has spiritual consequences. When we sin, we are guilty before a holy God who is just and righteous (Psalm 51:4). Our guilt is not just a matter of personal conscience or moral regret; it's a objective reality that requires a remedy.

The Bible teaches that our guilt is rooted in Adam's original sin, which brought death and separation from God into the world (Romans 5:12-14, 1 Corinthians 15:22). As a result, all humans are born with a sinful nature and are guilty before God (Ephesians 2:1-3).

The Bible also teaches that our guilt is not just a matter of personal failure or moral weakness; it's a cosmic problem that requires a divine solution. The penalty for sin is death (Romans 6:23), and the only way to escape this fate is through faith in Jesus Christ, who took upon Himself the punishment we deserved (John 3:36, Romans 8:1).

In biblical terms, being guilty means:

1. Being under God's judgment (Matthew 25:31-46).
2. Being separated from God's presence and fellowship (Isaiah 59:2).
3. Being in a state of spiritual darkness and despair (Ephesians 2:1-3).
4. Being subject to the consequences of sin, including physical and spiritual death (Romans 6:23).

However, Jesus Christ came to rescue us from this state of guilt by offering Himself as a sacrifice for our sins (John 3:16). Through faith in Him, we can be declared righteous and justified before God, receiving the gift of eternal life and forgiveness (Romans 5:1-11, 8:1).

In conclusion, being guilty according to the Bible means being under judgment, separated from God, and subject to the consequences of sin. But thanks be to God that He has provided a way for us to escape this state through faith in Jesus Christ!
