  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the distinctions between \"heaven\" and \"sky\" in the biblical context, showing a good understanding of the nuances and implications of these terms. They have utilized scriptural references to support their points effectively. However, there is a bit of unnecessary complexity in their explanation that slightly deviates from the core of the biblical definitions provided in the reference answer. Overall, a solid response that demonstrates a deep dive into the topic."
