In the Bible, the terms "heaven" (Hebrew: שמים, shamayim; Greek: οὐρανός, ouranos) and "sky" are often used interchangeably, but there is a subtle distinction.

The Hebrew term "shamayim" can refer to:

1. The expanse of sky above us, the atmosphere, or the firmament (Genesis 1:20, Job 22:12).
2. The realm of God's throne, His dwelling place, or the heavens as the habitation of God and the angels (Psalm 137:5-6, Isaiah 66:1).

In this sense, "heaven" can be seen as a metaphorical or spiritual realm that transcends the physical sky.

On the other hand, the term "sky" (Hebrew: שחק, shachak; Greek: οὐρανος, ouranos) is often used to describe the physical atmosphere above us, the firmament, or the expanse of space (Genesis 1:8, Psalm 104:2).

In contrast to "heaven," which can connote a more transcendent or spiritual realm, the term "sky" tends to focus on the physical, earthly aspect.

The biblical distinction between "heaven" and "sky" is not always clear-cut, as both terms are used to convey different aspects of God's creation. However, when considering the biblical definitions:

* "Heaven" often refers to the spiritual or divine realm, emphasizing God's presence and glory.
* "Sky" generally focuses on the physical atmosphere above us, highlighting God's creation and His relationship with humanity.

Keep in mind that this distinction is not absolute and can vary depending on the context of each passage. Nonetheless, recognizing these nuances can enrich our understanding of the Bible's teachings about the nature of God, creation, and eternity.
