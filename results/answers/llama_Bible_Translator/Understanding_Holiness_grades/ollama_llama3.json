  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of explaining the concept of God's absolute holiness, drawing from Scripture and providing relevant examples. The writer effectively highlights the implications of God's holiness for our relationship with Him, including the need for Jesus Christ as our mediator, our approach to Him in reverence and humility, our recognition of His justice and wrath against sin, and ultimately, our comfort and hope in His redemption through Jesus Christ.\n\nThe response also does a good job of addressing the concern prompted by this question, reflecting on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God. The writer's conclusion is well-summarized and effectively restates the main points made throughout the response.\n\nOne area where the response could improve is in its treatment of the concept of absolute holiness as it relates to our own holiness. While the response does touch on this topic, it could be further developed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how God's holiness affects us and our relationship with Him.\n\nComment: Overall, this response is well-written and effectively communicates the importance of God's absolute holiness in Christian theology. With some additional development on the topic of our own holiness, this response could be even stronger."
