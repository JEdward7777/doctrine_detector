  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of God's absolute holiness within Christian theology, drawing on relevant Scripture and theological implications. It addresses the concern by emphasizing the need for our recognition of our own sinfulness and dependency on God's mercy to approach Him. The integration of biblical references and theological reflection is strong, making this a comprehensive and well-supported response from a Christian worldview."
