# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Christian perspective, to humble oneself before God means to recognize one's limitations and weaknesses in the face of His majesty, power, and sovereignty. It involves acknowledging that we are not self-sufficient or autonomous, but rather dependent on God for everything.

This concept is deeply rooted in Scripture. For example, Psalm 51:17 says, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise." In this passage, David recognizes that true worship comes from a humble and contrite heart, one that is willing to acknowledge its own sinfulness and need for forgiveness.

Similarly, Jesus teaches us to pray with humility in Matthew 6:5-6: "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen."

To humble oneself before God means to:

1. Recognize one's own sinfulness and need for forgiveness (Luke 18:13-14).
2. Acknowledge that all good things come from God (James 1:17) and not from our own efforts or accomplishments.
3. Submit to God's will, even when it is difficult or unclear (Matthew 26:39; John 12:27-28).
4. Seek guidance and wisdom from God rather than relying on human understanding (Proverbs 3:5-6; James 1:5).
5. Be willing to put others' interests before one's own, as Jesus did (Philippians 2:8).

In the Christian perspective, humility is not just about being modest or unassuming, but also about recognizing our dependence on God and living according to His will. It involves a willingness to surrender our pride, self-reliance, and autonomy to God, trusting in His sovereignty and loving care.

As the apostle Paul writes, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others" (Philippians 2:3-4).
