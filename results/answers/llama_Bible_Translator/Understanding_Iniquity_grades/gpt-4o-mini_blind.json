The student effectively breaks down the nuances of each Hebrew word, supported by relevant scriptural references. The integration of Christian theology, particularly the role of Jesus Christ in addressing these aspects of human disobedience, is commendable. The clarity and depth of the explanation demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective. Great job!"
