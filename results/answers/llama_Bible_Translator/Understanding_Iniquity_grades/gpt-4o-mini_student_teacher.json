  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression, incorporating relevant Bible verses to support their points. They demonstrated a good understanding of how these distinctions reflect on human nature and the need for salvation. However, the student's explanation slightly deviated from the reference answer provided by the teacher in terms of the specific meanings attributed to each term. Overall, the student's response was insightful and well-structured, earning them a solid grade."
