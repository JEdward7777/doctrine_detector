## [Answer](../Understanding_Iniquity.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question!

In the Bible, three Hebrew words are often translated as "sin," but they carry distinct nuances. Understanding these distinctions can provide valuable insights into God's nature, human nature, and the scope of salvation.

1. **Awon** (אָוֺן): This word is commonly translated as "iniquity." It refers to a person's inherent moral corruption or depravity, resulting from the fall of humanity in Genesis 3. Awon describes the root problem of human nature, which is a predisposition to disobey God and rebel against His will (Romans 8:7-8). Iniquity is not just a single act but a fundamental flaw that permeates all aspects of a person's being.
2. **Chat** (חַטָּא): This word is often translated as "sin." It encompasses the idea of missing the mark or falling short of God's standard (Romans 3:23). Chat can refer to a specific act of disobedience, but it also carries the connotation of a departure from God's will. In this sense, sin is not just a mistake but a deliberate turning away from God and His ways.
3. **Pasha** (פֶּשַׁע): This word is commonly translated as "transgression." It implies a direct violation or disregard for God's law or commandment (Leviticus 5:17-18). Pasha emphasizes the act of disobedience rather than the underlying sinfulness. In this sense, transgression is a specific breach of God's rules, whereas sin and iniquity are more comprehensive concepts.

To summarize:

* Awon (iniquity) represents the root problem of human nature, a fundamental moral corruption.
* Chat (sin) encompasses both the idea of missing God's mark and the act of deliberate disobedience.
* Pasha (transgression) specifically refers to a direct violation or disregard for God's law.

In Christian theology, these distinctions are important because they highlight the scope of humanity's problem and the nature of salvation. Jesus Christ is seen as the solution to the root problem of iniquity, through His redemptive work on the cross. He also forgives individual sins (Chat) and provides a way for us to turn back to God and obey His laws (Pasha).

May this understanding bring you closer to the heart of God's Word!
