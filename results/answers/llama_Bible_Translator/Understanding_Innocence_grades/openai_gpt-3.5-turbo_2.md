## [Answer](../Understanding_Innocence.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a crucial question! In the biblical context, the term "innocent" (Hebrew: תִמּוֹר, timmor) or "guiltless" (Greek: ἀναμάρτητος, anamartatos) refers to someone who is free from moral guilt and sin before God. This concept is deeply rooted in the biblical understanding of human nature and divine justice.

When a person is wrongfully accused, the term "innocent" emphasizes that they have not committed any offense or sin against God's laws or standards. The innocent party is not responsible for their supposed wrongdoing and has no moral guilt to answer for. This understanding is grounded in Psalm 7:9, which states, "Let all the nations be instructed in it, and the companies of the peoples; who knows the judgment of Yahweh?" (HCSB).

In biblical law, an innocent person was one who had not broken God's laws or sinned against Him. For example, Exodus 20:15 commands, "Do not murder." If someone is wrongfully accused of murder and has committed no such act, they are considered innocent according to this command.

The concept of innocence is closely tied to the biblical understanding of justice, which requires that the guilty be punished and the innocent be vindicated (Deuteronomy 25:1). This principle is seen in the story of Joseph, who was falsely accused by Potiphar's wife but was ultimately vindicated and exonerated before Pharaoh himself (Genesis 39-41).

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is often referred to as "the innocent" or "innocent blood" (Matthew 27:4; Hebrews 13:20). His innocence refers not only to His lack of sin but also to His willingness to bear the punishment for humanity's sins on the cross. As the ultimate sacrifice, Jesus' innocence demonstrates God's justice and righteousness in forgiving sinners.

In summary, when a person is wrongfully accused, "innocent" signifies that they have not committed any offense or sin against God's laws or standards. This understanding is rooted in biblical principles of justice, morality, and the character of God, who seeks to vindicate the innocent and punish the guilty.
