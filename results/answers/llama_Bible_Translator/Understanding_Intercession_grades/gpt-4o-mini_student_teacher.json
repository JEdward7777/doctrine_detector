  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 80.\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and thorough explanation of the Holy Spirit's role in intercession, drawing from various Bible verses and offering insightful reflections on the topic. However, the response could be improved by focusing more closely on the direct reference answer provided by the teacher, which succinctly states the Bible's teaching on the Holy Spirit's intercession. Integrating more of the reference answer while still elaborating on it would strengthen the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective. Overall, a solid effort with room for refinement."
