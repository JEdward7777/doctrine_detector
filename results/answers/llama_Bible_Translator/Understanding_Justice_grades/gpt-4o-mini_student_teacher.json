  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided an excellent and thorough explanation of what it means to act justly according to God's laws, supported by relevant biblical references. The answer effectively addressed the concern by highlighting the importance of fairness, righteousness, and compassion in our interactions with others. The student's response demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical standard of justice and righteousness in light of God's character and commandments. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly relate the student's explanation to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
