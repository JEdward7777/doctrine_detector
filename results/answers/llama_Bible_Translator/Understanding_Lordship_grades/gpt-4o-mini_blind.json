  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. The student effectively covers key aspects such as sovereignty, holiness, divine lordship, and human lordship, supported by relevant scripture references. The explanation is clear, doctrinally sound, and aligns well with Christian teachings on the nature and significance of the title \"Lord.\" Great job overall in articulating the theological depth and significance of this term."
