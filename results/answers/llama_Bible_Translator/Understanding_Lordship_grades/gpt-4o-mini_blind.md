## [Answer](../Understanding_Lordship.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the term "Lord" (Hebrew: יהוה, Yahweh; Greek: κύριος, kyrios) is a title that conveys lordship, sovereignty, and divine authority. When referring to God, the Lord signifies:

1. Sovereignty: God is the supreme ruler of all creation, having absolute power and control over everything.
2. Holiness: The Lord is set apart from all else as being entirely separate, unique, and beyond human comprehension.
3. Majesty: The term conveys a sense of awe, reverence, and majesty, emphasizing God's grandeur and glory.

In relation to Jesus, the title "Lord" has a dual significance:

1. Divine Lordship: Jesus is referred to as the Lord from heaven (Acts 10:36), implying that He shares in the divine nature and authority of God.
2. Human Lordship: As the Son of Man, Jesus was given all authority in heaven and on earth by His Father (Matt. 28:18). This human lordship is exercised through His teachings, works, and sacrificial death.

Scriptural examples:

* In Old Testament contexts, "Lord" often refers to Yahweh, the God of Israel (e.g., Gen. 2:4; Ex. 3:15).
* In New Testament contexts, "Lord" is frequently used to address Jesus Christ (e.g., Matt. 7:21-22; John 5:22-23).
* Jesus claimed to be the Lord and God, equal with Yahweh (John 10:30; 17:3).

In summary, the term "Lord" in the Bible signifies God's sovereignty, holiness, and majesty when referring to Him. When applied to Jesus, it emphasizes His divine lordship as the Son of God and His human lordship as the Son of Man, exercising authority over all creation.
