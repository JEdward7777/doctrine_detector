  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated answer that delved into the significance of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. They effectively highlighted the key aspects of sovereignty, holiness, and divine authority associated with the term 'Lord.' Additionally, the student made relevant scriptural references to support their points. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing more explicitly the ownership and authority conveyed by the term 'Lord,' as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. This addition would further strengthen the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
