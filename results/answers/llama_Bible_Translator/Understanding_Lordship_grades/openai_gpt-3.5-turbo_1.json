It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding the term 'Lord' is crucial for recognizing the authority and divinity of Jesus and God. The response could be strengthened by explicitly mentioning the aspects of sovereignty, holiness, and majesty attributed to God using the title 'Lord', as these are important components of understanding divine authority from a Christian worldview."
