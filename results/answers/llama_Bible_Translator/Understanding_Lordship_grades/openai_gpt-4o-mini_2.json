It effectively addresses the concern by discussing the authority and divinity conveyed by this title. The scriptural examples and the dual significance of \"Lord\" in reference to Jesus are well-explained, showcasing a solid understanding of the Christian worldview. The only slight point for improvement could be directly connecting the response to the concern raised in the prompt at the beginning of the answer to enhance clarity from the outset."
