  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response regarding the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's character. They effectively discussed the biblical references and theological implications of God's majesty, emphasizing His glory, power, and sovereignty. The student also made appropriate connections between God's majesty and His attributes such as holiness, authority, and greatness. However, the student's answer could have been enhanced by focusing more directly on the simplicity and directness of the reference answer provided by the teacher, which highlighted the greatness and splendor of God as the supreme King over the universe."
