  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer on demonstrating mercy in daily lives, drawing from biblical principles and examples. The response effectively addresses the concern of embodying God's merciful nature in interactions with others by offering practical and tangible ways to show mercy. The suggestions are aligned with Christian values and encourage a consistent practice of mercy. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused on the core elements of mercy, as seen in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Nonetheless, the student's thoughtful insights and application of biblical principles warrant a high grade."
