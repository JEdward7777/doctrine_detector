## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I'm delighted to help clarify this crucial concept!

In the New Testament, being "born again" (Greek: γеніζω ἄνωθεν, genizō anōthen) is described in three main passages: John 3:3-7, James 1:18, and 1 Peter 1:23-25. Here's a breakdown of what it means to be "born again" according to the Bible:

**John 3:3-7**: Jesus says to Nicodemus, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God." This passage emphasizes that being born again is a spiritual rebirth, not a physical one. It's a transformation from being naturally inclined towards sin and separation from God (Ephesians 2:1-3) to becoming a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). This regeneration involves receiving the Holy Spirit, who gives us new life and enables us to understand spiritual things (John 14:26).

**James 1:18**: In this passage, James writes that we are "born again" when we heed the implanted word of God, which is able to save our souls. This verse highlights the role of Scripture in facilitating regeneration.

**1 Peter 1:23-25**: Peter states that our faith is not based on human reasoning but on God's divine power, which gives us new birth into an "unfading inheritance." He also mentions that we have become His own people through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This passage emphasizes the connection between being born again and having a living hope in Jesus.

In summary, to be "born again" means:

1. To experience a spiritual rebirth, not physical.
2. To receive new life from the Holy Spirit (John 3:5).
3. To become a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17).
4. To have our souls saved through faith and the implanted word of God (James 1:18).
5. To have a living hope in Jesus, with an unfading inheritance (1 Peter 1:23-25).

This miraculous transformation is available to all who put their trust in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, confessing Him before men (Matthew 10:32).
