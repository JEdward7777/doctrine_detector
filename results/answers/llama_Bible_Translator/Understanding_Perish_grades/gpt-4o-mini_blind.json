The explanation connects well with key verses and teachings about salvation, judgment, and the consequences of sin. The emphasis on the need for a personal relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ is commendable. However, the answer could be strengthened with additional references to the doctrine of eternal separation in a more explicit manner, along with mentioning the significance of Christ's atonement in addressing the issue of spiritual perishing."
