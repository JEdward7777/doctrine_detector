  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of what it means to \"perish\" in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. They accurately connected the concept to eternal separation from God and the importance of faith in Jesus for salvation. However, the student's answer was more detailed and expansive than the reference answer, which could be seen as unnecessary elaboration in this context. In a Christian worldview, simplicity and clarity in presenting theological concepts are often valued."
