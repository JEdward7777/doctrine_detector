  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 90\n\n**Comments:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical concepts of salvation, judgment, and eternal separation from God. The student clearly explains the different contexts in which the term \"perish\" is used in the New Testament, and how it relates to both rejecting Jesus and failing to follow his teachings. The connection between sin, separation from God's love, and spiritual death is also effectively explained. The conclusion clearly summarizes the main points and reinforces the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for eternal life."
