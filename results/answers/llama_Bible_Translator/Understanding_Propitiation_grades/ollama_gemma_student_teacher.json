The student clearly articulates the biblical concept of propitiation and its relation to God's justice and mercy. The response also highlights the key aspects of Jesus' sacrifice as a substitutionary, satisfatory, and propitiatory act that effectively removes the penalty of sin and restores peace between God and humanity."
