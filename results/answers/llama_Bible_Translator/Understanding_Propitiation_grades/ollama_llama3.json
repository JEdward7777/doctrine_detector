The writer effectively explains that Jesus' sacrifice satisfied God's justice and appeased His wrath, providing a means for sinners to receive forgiveness and eternal life. The response also includes specific biblical references (Romans 6:23, Isaiah 53:5, John 3:16) which supports the explanation of propitiation. The only area that could be improved is the inclusion of more depth and nuance in the discussion of Jesus' sacrifice as a propitiatory sacrifice, as well as its implications for our salvation. Overall, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy."
