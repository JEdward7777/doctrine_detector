It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice by bearing the punishment for sin, while also demonstrating God's mercy by providing a means for forgiveness and eternal life. The response is well-supported with scriptural references and conveys a clear understanding of the Christian concept of propitiation within the context of God's justice and mercy. Great job!"
