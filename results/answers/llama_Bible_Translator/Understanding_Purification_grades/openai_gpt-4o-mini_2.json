It also includes key examples of purification rituals from the Old Testament. While the response emphasizes the cleansing from ritual uncleanness and sin through animal sacrifices, it could further strengthen the understanding by highlighting how the process of ritual purification reflects God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin more explicitly within a Christian worldview."
