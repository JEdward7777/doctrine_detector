## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
When the Bible describes God as "righteous" (Hebrew: צדיק, tsadik; Greek: δίκαιος, dikaios), it conveys several profound truths about His nature and character. In Christian theology, righteousness is a fundamental attribute of God that speaks to His holy, just, and perfect nature.

In essence, "righteous" means that God is absolutely just and fair in all His ways. He is the ultimate standard of moral perfection, and His actions are always in accordance with His own eternal law and will. This concept is rooted in Scripture, particularly in passages like Psalm 99:4, Isaiah 45:21, and Revelation 15:3-4.

Several implications follow from this attribute:

1. **God's justice**: God's righteousness ensures that He is just in all His dealings, whether it be judging sin or showing mercy to those who trust in Him (Romans 9:14).
2. **God's moral perfection**: As the ultimate standard of morality, God's righteousness means that He is free from any hint of evil, wickedness, or imperfection.
3. **God's holiness**: The righteous nature of God underscores His absolute separation from all that is sinful and impure (Isaiah 6:1-5).
4. **The basis for moral judgments**: As the ultimate authority on morality, God's righteousness provides the foundation for moral judgments, both in this life and the next.
5. **A standard for humanity**: The righteousness of God serves as a benchmark for human morality, highlighting our need for redemption through faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 3:21-26).

In summary, when we describe God as "righteous," we affirm His absolute justice, moral perfection, and holiness. This attribute is central to understanding God's nature and character, and it has far-reaching implications for our understanding of morality, redemption, and eternity.
