  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the concept of God being described as \"righteous\" from a Christian worldview. They have effectively referenced Scripture to support their points and have shown a clear understanding of the theological implications of God's righteousness. Overall, this answer demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic and effectively presents it in a coherent and doctrinally sound manner. Great job!"
