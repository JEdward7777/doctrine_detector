  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of why Jesus is referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. They demonstrate a deep understanding of the sacrificial system and how Jesus fulfilled it as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sin. The response is well-supported with relevant biblical references and connections, aligning closely with the teacher's reference answer. Great job!"
