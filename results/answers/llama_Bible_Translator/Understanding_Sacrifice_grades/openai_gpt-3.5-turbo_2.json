It effectively connects the symbolism of the Old Testament sacrificial system with Jesus' role as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sin, highlighting His innocence, purity, sacrificial purpose, and divine approval. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian theology and effectively addresses the concern presented. Well done!"
