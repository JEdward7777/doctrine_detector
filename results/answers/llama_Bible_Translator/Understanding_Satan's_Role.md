## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of the Christian faith, the name "Satan" is derived from the Hebrew word "ha-Satan," which means "the accuser" or "the adversary." In the Bible, Satan is often referred to as the devil or Beelzebub.

In biblical terms, Satan is a fallen angel who was once a member of God's heavenly host. According to Scripture, Satan rebelled against God and led a third of the angels in heaven to follow him (Revelation 12:4). This rebellion is often referred to as the "fall" or the "great fall."

As the accuser, Satan is depicted as a relentless pursuer of humanity, seeking to lead people away from God and into sin. He is described as a sly and cunning being who uses deceit and manipulation to achieve his goals (Genesis 3:1-5, Matthew 4:1-11).

In Christian theology, Satan's primary role is to oppose the will of God and to tempt humanity away from obedience to God's laws. This opposition is seen in various forms throughout Scripture, including:

1. Tempting humans to disobey God's commands (Genesis 3:1-5, Matthew 4:1-11)
2. Seeking to destroy those who follow God (Job 1:8-12, Matthew 12:22-24)
3. Leading nations and kingdoms into idolatry and rebellion against God (Ezekiel 28:13-19, Revelation 17:1-6)

Despite Satan's power and influence, Christians believe that he is ultimately a defeated foe, having been cast out of heaven and punished for his rebellion (Revelation 12:7-9). Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is seen as the ultimate victor over Satan, having defeated him through His death and resurrection (Colossians 2:15, Hebrews 2:14).

In summary, the name "Satan" signifies a fallen angel who serves as the accuser or adversary of humanity, seeking to lead people away from God and into sin. However, Christians believe that Satan is ultimately defeated by Jesus Christ, and his influence is limited by God's sovereignty and the power of the gospel.
