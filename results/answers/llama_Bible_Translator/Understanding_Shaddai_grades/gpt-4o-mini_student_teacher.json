  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the term \"Shaddai\" in the Old Testament, demonstrating a strong understanding of its significance in revealing God's attributes. The response effectively covers the various contexts in which the term is used and its implications for understanding God's power, sovereignty, and provision. However, the explanation could benefit from acknowledging the specific origin of the term \"Shaddai\" as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Integrating this additional information would strengthen the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
