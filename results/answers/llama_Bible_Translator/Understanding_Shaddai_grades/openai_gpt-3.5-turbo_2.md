## [Answer](../Understanding_Shaddai.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The Hebrew term "Shaddai" (שַׁדַי) is a crucial concept in the Old Testament, particularly in the book of Job. It is an important name for God that reveals His character and attributes.

In Genesis 17:1, when God appears to Abraham, He introduces Himself as "El Shaddai," which means "God Almighty" or "The All-Sufficient One." This name emphasizes God's power, sovereignty, and ability to fulfill His promises. The phrase "Shaddai" is often used interchangeably with "Elohim" (אֱלוֹהִים), which refers to God as the Creator.

In the Old Testament, Shaddai is used in several contexts:

1. As a name for God: In Genesis 49:25 and Exodus 6:3, God identifies Himself as El Shaddai when He appears to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
2. To emphasize God's power: The term "Shaddai" is often linked with words that convey God's might, such as "mighty" (Deuteronomy 10:17), "strong" (Job 28:28), or " Omnipotent" (Psalm 147:5).
3. In relation to God's covenant: When God makes a covenant with Abraham and his descendants, He uses the name Shaddai to signify His commitment to fulfill His promises (Genesis 15:7; 28:13).
4. To describe God's provision: The term "Shaddai" can also convey God's ability to provide for His people, as seen in Exodus 34:24 and Deuteronomy 32:12.

The Old Testament writers used the name Shaddai to highlight God's:

1. Omnipotence: God is all-powerful and able to fulfill His promises.
2. Sovereignty: He is the supreme ruler over all creation.
3. Providence: God provides for His people, meeting their needs and fulfilling His covenant.

In the book of Job, the term "Shaddai" takes on a deeper significance. Job's friends use this name to describe God's power and sovereignty in response to Job's suffering (Job 5:17; 11:7). However, when God speaks directly to Job, He uses the name Shaddai to emphasize His own omnipotence and wisdom (Job 37:23).

In summary, the Hebrew term "Shaddai" is a richly textured concept that reveals God's power, sovereignty, provision, and covenantal commitment. As we engage with the Old Testament, understanding this term helps us grasp the character of our all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving God.
