  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of providing specific examples from Jesus' encounter with Satan in Matthew 4, which directly addresses the concern of how to combat temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. The writer skillfully breaks down Jesus' strategies for resisting temptation into four categories: acknowledging human limitations and dependence on God, using Scripture as a sword against Satan's attacks, understanding one's identity and purpose, and relying on the empowerment of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the response doesn't explicitly state how these strategies can be applied to daily life. While the writer does suggest that readers can \"learn to resist temptation\" by incorporating Jesus' strategies into their lives, they don't provide concrete examples or practical advice for how to do so.\n\nOverall, however, this response is well-organized, biblically grounded, and effectively communicates the importance of using Scripture, faith, and the Holy Spirit to combat temptation in our daily lives."
