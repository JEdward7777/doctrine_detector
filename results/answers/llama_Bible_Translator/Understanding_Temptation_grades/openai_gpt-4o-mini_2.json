The integration of biblical references and the application of these strategies to daily life as a follower of Christ are well articulated. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie Jesus' strategies back to the original answer that focused on scripture and unwavering faith, to further emphasize the relevance of these insights for combating temptation in daily life."
