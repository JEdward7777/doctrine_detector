## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In a Biblical context, the term "transgress" (Hebrew: פָּגַר, pagar; Greek: παραβαίνω, parabainō) implies a deliberate and willful act of disobedience or disregard for God's commands, laws, or standards.

The Hebrew verb pagar is often used to describe the breaking of covenant relationships between humans (e.g., Num 25:3-4) or with God (e.g., Lev 26:14). It can also refer to the violation of specific laws or statutes (e.g., Ex 23:13).

In the New Testament, the Greek verb parabainō carries a similar connotation. It is often used to describe acts of disobedience against God's will or commands (e.g., Matt 15:20; Mark 7:24-25), as well as violations of moral standards (e.g., Rom 2:22).

In both Testaments, transgression implies a conscious decision to ignore or disregard God's revealed will, which can have serious consequences for one's relationship with Him. According to Scripture, all humanity has sinned and transgressed against God (Rom 3:23; Eph 2:1-3), leading to separation from God and our need for redemption through faith in Jesus Christ.

As a Christian Bible translator, I must emphasize that the concept of transgression is not just about breaking rules or laws, but also about rejecting God's loving relationship with us. It's a crucial aspect of understanding our fallen state and the importance of repentance and forgiveness in our walk with God.
