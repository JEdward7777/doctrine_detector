The incorporation of specific biblical references and the emphasis on the relational aspect of transgression align well with a Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further connect the concept of transgression to the overarching theme of redemption through Jesus Christ, emphasizing the pathway to restoration and reconciliation with God."
