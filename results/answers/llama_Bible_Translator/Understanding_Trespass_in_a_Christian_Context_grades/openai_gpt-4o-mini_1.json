It effectively connects interpersonal violations with sins against God by referencing biblical examples and demonstrating the consequences of disobedience. The explanation of the fall of humanity and the role of Jesus Christ in restoring the broken relationship with God is well articulated. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God in Christian ethics. Overall, a solid and well-supported response."
