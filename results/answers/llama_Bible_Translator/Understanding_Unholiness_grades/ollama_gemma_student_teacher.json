They accurately identify the core characteristics of an unholy life as rebellion against God, actions that dishonor Him, and practices that are not set apart for His glory. The connection to worldly lust and pride is also well-articulated. Overall, the answer is well-reasoned and demonstrates a thorough grasp of the Christian worldview."
