## [Answer](../Understanding_Unholiness.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I must emphasize that the concept of "unholy" is deeply rooted in God's revelation to humanity through Scripture. In 1 John 2:15-17, the apostle John writes, "Do not love the world or any thing in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life—is not from God but is from the world."
