  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This is a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the term \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments. The student effectively explores the biblical usage of \"woe\" in both Old and New Testament contexts, citing relevant passages and providing a clear analysis of its significance. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications of divine judgment and the call to repentance. Great job overall."
