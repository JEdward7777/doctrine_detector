  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the term \"worldly\" according to Christian teachings, detailing various negative behaviors and values associated with it. They also effectively contrasted these worldly values with godly principles. However, while their answer is comprehensive, it lacks conciseness and could have focused more on addressing the specific concern of understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, the student could have incorporated more direct references to scripture to support their points and strengthen their argument. Overall, a solid effort but could benefit from more focus and integration of Biblical references."
