  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of explaining the concept of \"worldly\" in Christian theology, providing clear examples and biblical references to support its claims. The writer effectively highlights the contrast between worldly values (selfishness, materialism, pride, rebellion against God) and godly principles (humility, love, faithfulness, gentleness). The response also demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of living according to God's will and values.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the writer could have gone into more depth on some of the points. For example, while they mention that worldly people tend to be proud and arrogant, they don't explain why this is a problem or how it relates to their rebellion against God. Additionally, the response could have included more practical examples of what living according to godly principles looks like in everyday life.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that effectively communicates the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, and I would give it a grade of 90."
