  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the contrast between worldly values and godly principles from a Christian perspective. It effectively expands on the concept of \"worldly\" to include specific behaviors and attitudes that are contrary to God's will, while also highlighting the virtues emphasized in Christian teachings. The incorporation of biblical references adds depth and credibility to the explanation. Overall, this answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern presented."
