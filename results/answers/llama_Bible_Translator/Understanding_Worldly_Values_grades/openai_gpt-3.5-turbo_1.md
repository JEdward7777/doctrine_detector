## [Answer](../Understanding_Worldly_Values.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In Christian theology, the term "worldly" typically refers to those aspects of human life that are contrary to God's will and are driven by a focus on self-interest, power, and material possessions. According to Christian teachings, worldly behaviors and values are characterized by:

1. Self-centeredness: Worldly people prioritize their own desires and interests above all else, often at the expense of others.
2. Materialism: They value wealth, status, and possessions over spiritual matters and relationships with God and others.
3. Pride: Worldly individuals tend to be proud and arrogant, elevating themselves above others and refusing to acknowledge their need for God's guidance and forgiveness.
4. Rebellion against God: Their actions often demonstrate a rejection of God's will, laws, and teachings, as they seek to establish their own authority and control.
5. Lack of humility: Worldly people tend to be unwilling to admit their weaknesses, apologize, or show genuine remorse for their mistakes.

In contrast, Christian teachings emphasize the importance of living according to God's values and principles, which are often described as:

1. Humility: Recognizing one's dependence on God and being willing to learn from others.
2. Love: Prioritizing relationships with God and others over personal gain or recognition.
3. Faithfulness: Staying committed to God's will and ways, even in the face of uncertainty or adversity.
4. Gentleness: Demonstrating kindness, compassion, and patience towards others.

The Bible offers many examples of worldly behaviors being contrasted with godly ones. For instance, Jesus' teachings in Matthew 5-7 (the Sermon on the Mount) highlight the difference between God's kingdom values and those of the world. Similarly, Paul's letters to the churches in Asia Minor (e.g., 1 Corinthians 3:18-23; Galatians 6:14-16) emphasize the importance of living for eternal purposes rather than being driven by worldly concerns.

In summary, according to Christian teachings, "worldly" implies behaviors and values that are contrary to God's will, characterized by self-centeredness, materialism, pride, rebellion against God, and a lack of humility. In contrast, Christian living prioritizes humility, love, faithfulness, and gentleness, as individuals seek to align their lives with God's purposes and values.
