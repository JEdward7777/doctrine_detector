The student provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of worship as both physical acts and spiritual sacrifices, drawing support from relevant biblical passages. The response clearly conveys the essence of worship as honoring, praising, and obeying God, and highlights the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty, expressing gratitude for redemption, and offering oneself as a living sacrifice."
