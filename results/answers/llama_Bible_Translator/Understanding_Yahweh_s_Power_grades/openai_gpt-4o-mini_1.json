It effectively addresses the concern by delving into how God's authority is demonstrated through His eternal existence, unchangeability, power, relational intimacy, and redemptive purpose. The response effectively builds on the original answer and offers a deeper insight into the implications of God's commands in light of His nature as revealed through the statement \"I am Yahweh.\" Overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on God's authority."
