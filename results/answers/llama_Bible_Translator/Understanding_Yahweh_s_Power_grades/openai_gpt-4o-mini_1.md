## [Answer](../Understanding_Yahweh_s_Power.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The statement "I am Yahweh" (Hebrew: אֶהֱיֵה יְהוָה, Ehyeh asher Ehyeh) is a profound declaration by God Himself, revealing His character and power in the context of commands and promises. This phrase appears in Exodus 3:14-15, where Yahweh (the name means "I am who I am" or "I am He who is") speaks to Moses from the burning bush.

In this context, "I am Yahweh" reveals several aspects of God's character and power:

1. **Eternal existence**: The phrase implies that God has always been, and always will be, existing independently of time and human comprehension. This underscores His self-sufficiency and timeless nature.
2. **Unchangeability**: By saying "I am who I am," Yahweh emphasizes His unchanging character, commitment, and purposes. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8).
3. **Power and authority**: The declaration of "I am Yahweh" underscores God's absolute power over creation, underscoring His ability to do as He pleases (Exodus 3:20). This phrase sets the stage for the subsequent commands and promises, demonstrating Yahweh's sovereignty and authority.
4. **Relational intimacy**: The use of "I am" (Hebrew: אֶהֱיֵה) creates a sense of personal connection between God and His people. This phrase is often used in intimate conversations between friends or loved ones, emphasizing the relational aspect of Yahweh's character.
5. **Redemptive purpose**: In Exodus 3:7-10, Yahweh declares Himself as the one who sees the suffering of His people (the Israelites) and intends to rescue them from slavery. This highlights His merciful and redeeming nature.

In terms of commands and promises, "I am Yahweh" sets the stage for God's instructions to Moses and the subsequent covenant between Yahweh and Israel (Exodus 20:1-17). The phrase:

* Authorizes the commands given to Moses, as Yahweh's authority and power are demonstrated by His very existence.
* Establishes the foundation for the promises of redemption, deliverance, and blessing made to Israel.
* Emphasizes the importance of obedience, as Yahweh's people are called to trust and follow Him based on His character and power.

In summary, "I am Yahweh" reveals God's eternal existence, unchangeability, power, relational intimacy, and redemptive purpose, setting the stage for the commands and promises that follow.
