  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the term \"Daughter of Zion\" as a figurative expression referring to the people of Israel, emphasizing God's affection and care for them. This aligns with the given answer. Additionally, the response provides context and explains the significance of the term in prophetic literature, highlighting God's love and desire for His people.\n\nThe concern about understanding metaphorical language is well-addressed in this response, as it delves into the figurative nature of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" and its implications for God's relationship with His people. The explanation of how the phrase represents the city of Jerusalem, symbolizing the people of Israel and their spiritual condition, demonstrates a good understanding of biblical imagery.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in exploring the deeper theological significance of Jesus being referred to as \"the daughter of Zion\" in Isaiah 37:22-23. While the response acknowledges this passage, it does not fully develop its implications for our understanding of God's relationship with His people through Jesus Christ.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of biblical metaphor and its connection to God's relationship with His people, making it a strong 85 out of 100."
