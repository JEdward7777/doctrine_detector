## Question [Understanding of Sheol and Hades](../../questions/Understanding_of_Sheol_and_Hades.md)
How do the concepts of Sheol and Hades differ in the context of the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous?

## Target answer from notes
In biblical context, Sheol and Hades refer to a place of the dead but were understood differently over time. Initially, both represented a neutral place where all the dead awaited judgment. However, in the New Testament, Hades becomes associated primarily with the unrighteous, contrasting with 'Abraham's side' or 'paradise' for the righteous.

## Concern to grade by

## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
What a great question! As a Christian Bible translator, I'm happy to help clarify the differences between Sheol and Hades in the context of the Bible.

In the Old Testament (OT), Sheol is the Hebrew word used to describe the place where the dead reside after their mortal lives end. The concept of Sheol is often translated as "the grave" or "death." In OT contexts, Sheol is not necessarily a place of punishment or reward, but rather a neutral destination for all humans, regardless of their moral standing.

On the other hand, Hades appears in the Septuagint (LXX), the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, and in the New Testament (NT). In these contexts, Hades is often translated as "hell" or "grave." However, in the NT, Hades takes on a more specific meaning.

In the NT, Sheol is replaced by Hades, which becomes synonymous with the abode of the wicked dead. Luke 16:19-31 describes Hades as a place where Lazarus, the beggar, is comforted after death, while Dives, the rich man, is tormented in a lake of fire. This passage suggests that Hades is a place of suffering for the unrighteous.

In contrast, the righteous dead are often referred to as being in Abraham's bosom (Luke 16:22-23) or the bosom of Abraham (Matthew 8:21), implying a place of comfort and rest. The apostle Paul writes that Christ has "abolished death and had the power to impart life and immortality" (2 Timothy 1:10), indicating that believers will experience eternal life, rather than simply being in Sheol or Hades.

The NT also introduces the concept of Gehenna (Matthew 5:22, 29-30; Mark 9:43-44; Luke 12:5), which is often translated as "hell." Gehenna was a real place outside Jerusalem where people were burned alive. In the NT, it becomes a symbol for eternal punishment and torment for those who reject God's love.

In summary:

* Sheol in the OT refers to the common grave of all humans, with no moral implications.
* Hades in the LXX and NT takes on a more negative connotation, becoming synonymous with hell or the abode of the wicked dead.
* The righteous dead are often referred to as being in Abraham's bosom or enjoying eternal life.
* Gehenna in the NT represents eternal punishment and torment for those who reject God's love.

As Christian Bible translators, it's essential to understand these nuances when rendering terms like Sheol, Hades, and Gehenna into modern languages. By doing so, we can accurately convey the biblical message of hope and salvation through Jesus Christ.
