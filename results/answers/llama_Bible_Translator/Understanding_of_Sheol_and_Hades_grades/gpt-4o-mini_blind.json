  "grade_comment": "This response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the concepts of Sheol, Hades, and Gehenna in the Bible, specifically in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. The student demonstrates a good understanding of these biblical terms and their significance. Doctrinally, the explanation aligns well with Christian teachings on the afterlife. However, there were a few areas where additional scriptural references could have been included to strengthen the argument. Overall, the response is solid and informative.\n\nGrade: 90\n\nComment: The explanation provides a clear and accurate understanding of Sheol, Hades, and Gehenna in biblical context.
