  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the concepts of Sheol, Hades, and Gehenna in the Bible, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. They effectively differentiate between Sheol and Hades, and correctly highlight the distinction in afterlife destinations for the righteous and the unrighteous. However, the student's explanation could be improved by focusing more on the specific concern of understanding the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death. Additionally, referencing the provided teacher's reference answer and aligning the response more closely with its concise summary could have strengthened the overall clarity and relevance of the explanation."
