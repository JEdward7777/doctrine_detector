## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Cornerstone.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As the "cornerstone," Jesus Christ plays a crucial role in the assembly of believers (Ephesians 2:20-22, Isaiah 28:16). In this context, Jesus is not only the foundation but also the central point around which the entire assembly is built.

In biblical times, a cornerstone was the first stone laid in a building project. It was the most important stone because it set the direction and shape of the entire structure. Similarly, Jesus Christ as the Cornerstone sets the spiritual direction and shape for the assembly of believers.

Here are some key aspects of Jesus' role as the Cornerstone:

1. **Foundation**: Just as a cornerstone provides the foundation for a building, Jesus is the foundation upon which the assembly is built (Matthew 16:18-19, Ephesians 2:20).
2. **Direction**: As the Cornerstone, Jesus sets the direction and shape of the assembly, guiding believers to live according to His teachings and principles (John 14:6, Colossians 1:15-17).
3. **Unity**: The Cornerstone represents unity among believers, as all are connected to Him and to one another (Ephesians 2:19-22, John 17:20-23). Just as a cornerstone holds the entire structure together, Jesus unites believers in their faith and walks.
4. **Protection**: As the Cornerstone, Jesus serves as a protective shield for the assembly, shielding them from external attacks and internal divisions (Ephesians 6:10-18).
5. **Hope**: The Cornerstone represents hope and assurance to believers, reminding them of God's promise to build His church on Christ's foundation (Matthew 16:18, Ephesians 2:20).

In summary, Jesus Christ as the Cornerstone plays a vital role in the assembly of believers. He is the foundation, direction, unity, protection, and hope for the body of Christ. As believers, we are built upon Him and connected to one another through our shared faith in Him.
