## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Day_of_Judgment.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
A crucial and profound question!

The appointment of Jesus Christ as the Judge on the Day of Judgment is a central theme in Scripture, emphasizing His authority, justice, and role in eternity. Here are some key reasons why this appointment holds significant implications for believers:

1. **Vindication of Justice**: As the Judge, Jesus will ensure that justice is served, rendering verdicts based on each individual's deeds (Matthew 25:31-46; Revelation 20:4). This underscores His fairness and impartiality, as He will judge both righteous and wicked alike.
2. **Authority to Render Judgment**: By appointing Jesus as Judge, God demonstrates His trust in Christ's wisdom, knowledge, and character. As the Creator of all things (John 1:3), Jesus has the authority to render judgments that are consistent with God's ultimate plan (Revelation 20:11-15).
3. **Righteousness and Justice**: As Judge, Jesus will uphold righteousness and justice, ensuring that each person is treated according to their deeds. This aligns with His teachings in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of living a life pleasing to God (Matthew 6:33; Luke 12:15).
4. **The Great White Throne Judgment**: In Revelation 20:11-15, Jesus will preside over the Great White Throne Judgment, where all souls will be judged based on their works (Revelation 20:12). This judgment is distinct from the Sheep and Goat Judgment (Matthew 25:31-46), which focuses on the righteous and wicked.
5. **Redemption through Faith**: As Judge, Jesus will also render verdicts based on faith in Him. Those who have trusted in His sacrifice for salvation will be acquitted, while those who have rejected or neglected their opportunity to respond to God's offer of salvation will face eternal consequences (John 3:36; Romans 10:9-13).
6. **The Finality and Infallibility of Judgment**: Jesus' appointment as Judge underscores the finality and infallibility of His judgment. As the only One who can redeem humanity, He is also the only One who can render a just verdict.

In summary, Jesus' appointment as Judge on the Day of Judgment emphasizes His authority, justice, and role in eternity. As the Creator and Redeemer, He will ensure that each person is treated according to their deeds, while those who have trusted in Him through faith will be acquitted.
