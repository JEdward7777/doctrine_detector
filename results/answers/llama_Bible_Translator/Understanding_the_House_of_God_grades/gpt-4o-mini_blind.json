It effectively covers both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing the transition from physical structures like the Tabernacle and the temples to the spiritual reality of God dwelling among believers. The integration of key scriptures supports the explanation and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Well done!"
