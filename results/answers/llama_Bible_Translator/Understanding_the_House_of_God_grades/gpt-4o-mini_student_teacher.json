  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the concept of the \"house of God\" in both the Old and New Testaments. They have accurately outlined the significance of the term and its evolution throughout biblical history. The student effectively incorporates relevant scripture references to support their points and demonstrates an understanding of the spiritual dimension of the concept. However, the student's response could be improved by more explicitly connecting their explanation to the reference answer provided by the teacher, which focuses on the place where God is worshipped."
