  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that deeply explores various characteristics reflecting the image of God in human beings. Their understanding of the biblical references and the implications of being created in the image of God is evident. However, the student's response may have included some additional characteristics beyond the scope of the question, which could have been more focused on the specific characteristics highlighted in the teacher's reference answer."
