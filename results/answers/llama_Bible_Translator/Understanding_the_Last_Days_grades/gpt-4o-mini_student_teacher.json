  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-researched and detailed explanation of the concept of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings, drawing from various biblical passages and interpretations. However, the student's interpretation is more focused on the phases within the last days rather than encompassing the entire span from Jesus' first to second coming as indicated in the reference answer. Additionally, the student should have more clearly emphasized the final day of judgment as the endpoint of the last days according to Christian theology."
