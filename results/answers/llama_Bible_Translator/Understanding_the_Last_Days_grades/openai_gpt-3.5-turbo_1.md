## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Last_Days.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The "last days" is an expression used several times in the New Testament, particularly in the writings of Peter (Acts 2:17; 1 Peter 3:8-12) and John (Jude 18; 2 Peter 3:3). In this context, I'd like to explore how these "last days" relate to Jesus' first and second comings.

In Acts 2:16-21, Peter quotes Joel 2:28-32, which prophesies the outpouring of God's Spirit on all people in the last days. This event occurred at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4), where the Holy Spirit was poured out upon believers, empowering them to proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.

Now, regarding Jesus' first coming:

The "last days" in this context seem to refer to a period of intense spiritual awakening and apostolic ministry that would precede Jesus' return. This understanding is supported by Peter's statement in 1 Peter 3:8-12, where he connects the "last days" with the time between Christ's first coming and second coming.

In other words, the "last days" might be seen as a period of relative chaos and spiritual confusion before Jesus' return. This period would be marked by increased apostasy, false prophets, and a growing rejection of true faith (Matthew 24:3-14; Luke 17:22-37). However, this darkness would also be accompanied by the growth of true believers, who would be empowered by the Holy Spirit to proclaim Jesus as Lord.

Regarding Jesus' second coming:

The "last days" might also relate to the time immediately preceding Jesus' return. In this sense, the term "last days" could describe a period characterized by intense spiritual upheaval, deception, and ultimately, the consummation of all things (2 Peter 3:10-13). This view is supported by Jude's reference to the "last days" as a time when false teachers would arise and lead people astray, just before Jesus returns (Jude 17-18).

In summary:

The "last days" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings might be seen as follows:

1. The period between Christ's first coming and his second coming, marked by spiritual awakening, apostolic ministry, and a growing rejection of true faith.
2. The immediate time preceding Jesus' return, characterized by intense spiritual upheaval, deception, and ultimately, the consummation of all things.

Please note that these interpretations are based on my understanding of biblical theology and should not be taken as exhaustive or definitive explanations.
