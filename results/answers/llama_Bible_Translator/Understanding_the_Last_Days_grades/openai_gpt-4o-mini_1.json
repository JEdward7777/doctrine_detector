The integration of relevant scriptural references and theological analysis demonstrates a solid grasp of the subject matter. However, the response could have benefitted from more explicit connections to the initial simple answer provided, emphasizing the continuity and significance of the \"last days\" throughout the entire period between Jesus' comings."
