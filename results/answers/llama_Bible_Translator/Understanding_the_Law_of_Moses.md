The Law of Moses, also known as the Mosaic Law or the Torah, contains over 600 commandments given by God to the Israelites through Moses. Here are some specific examples:

1. The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:3-17; Deuteronomy 5:6-21):
	* Worship only God and no idols
	* Make no images or carve likenesses of any living creatures for worship
	* Observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy
	* Honor your parents
	* Do not murder
	* Do not commit adultery
	* Do not steal
	* Do not bear false witness against your neighbor
	* Do not covet anything that belongs to someone else

2. Food laws:
	* Eat only clean animals and fish (Leviticus 11:1-47; Deuteronomy 14:3-21)
	* Avoid consuming blood, flesh of a strangled animal, or meat with the life still in it (Deuteronomy 12:20-25; Leviticus 7:26-27)

3. Cleanliness and hygiene:
	* Separate clean and unclean animals (Leviticus 11:1-47)
	* Keep yourself and your clothes clean, especially during festivals (Leviticus 15:1-33; Numbers 19:2-10)

4. Social justice and morality:
	* Respect the rights of the poor, orphans, widows, and strangers (Deuteronomy 24:17-18; Exodus 22:21-27)
	* Do not exploit workers or withhold wages (Deuteronomy 24:14-15; Leviticus 19:13)
	* Show mercy to others, especially those who are vulnerable (Leviticus 25:35-43)

5. Worship and festivals:
	* Celebrate the Passover (Exodus 12:1-30) and other feasts like the Feast of Tabernacles (Leviticus 23:33-44)
	* Offer sacrifices to God, including grain, drink, and animal offerings (Leviticus 2:1-16; Leviticus 7:11-21)

These are just a few examples of the specific commandments included in the Law of Moses. Remember that these laws were given by God to guide the Israelites in their relationship with Him and with one another, and they ultimately pointed forward to Jesus Christ, who fulfilled and transcended them through His life, death, and resurrection.
