The student accurately lists key commandments such as the Ten Commandments, food laws, cleanliness regulations, social justice principles, and practices related to worship and festivals. The integration of relevant Bible references adds to the response's credibility and clarity. The mention of Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of these laws demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on the Old Testament Law. Great work overall!"
