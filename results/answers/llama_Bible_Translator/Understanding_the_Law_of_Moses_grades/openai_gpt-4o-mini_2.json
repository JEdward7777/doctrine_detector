The inclusion of moral, ceremonial, and civil instructions, along with the mention of Jesus Christ fulfilling and transcending these laws, demonstrates a solid grasp of the relevance of these laws for Christians today from a Christian worldview. Great job in addressing the concern with depth and clarity."
