  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-developed answer that delves deeply into the significance of the name 'Yahweh' in the Old Testament. They effectively addressed the concern of understanding the personal nature of God and His relationship with humanity by discussing Yahweh's uniqueness, covenant relationship, holiness, salvation, and its connection to Hebrew worship. The student's answer demonstrates a strong grasp of the theological implications of Yahweh's name, although it could have been further strengthened by explicitly tying the concept of 'to be' with God's existence as mentioned in the reference answer."
