The student provides a thorough explanation supported by relevant biblical references. There is a clear understanding of the doctrinal significance in portraying Jesus as the fulfillment of the judges' roles. The answer could benefit from further elaboration on the parallels between specific judges and Jesus Christ, as well as a clearer differentiation between the roles of the judges and Jesus as Savior."
