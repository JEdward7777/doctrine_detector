## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the Bible, the terms "spirit" (Hebrew: ruach; Greek: pneuma) refer to a non-physical entity that is connected to humans, animals, and God Himself. The Bible distinguishes between the human spirit, which is created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26), and evil spirits or demons, which are fallen angels that rebelled against God.

The human spirit is:

1. Created by God (Job 32:18; Zechariah 12:1): It is part of a person's being, distinct from their soul and body.
2. Capable of communing with God (Psalm 42:11; Matthew 5:8); humans are called to love and serve the Lord with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength (Mark 12:30).
3. Influenced by sin and its effects (Ecclesiastes 9:9; Galatians 5:16-17), which can lead to a disconnection from God.

Evil spirits or demons, on the other hand, are:

1. Fallen angels that rebelled against God (Isaiah 14:12-15; Ezekiel 28:13-19): They were created by God but chose to follow Satan, who is often referred to as the "prince of demons" (Matthew 25:41).
2. Opponents of God and humanity (1 Peter 5:8; Ephesians 6:12); they seek to lead people away from God's love and truth.
3. Capable of influencing humans, often through deception or temptation (Luke 22:3-7; Acts 16:16-18), which can result in sin and spiritual darkness.

The Bible also speaks about the existence of neutral spirits, sometimes referred to as "skeptics" or "ungodly" spirits (Hebrews 11:23). These are not necessarily evil but rather do not have a clear connection to God or humanity.

In summary, while both human and evil spirits are non-physical entities, they differ significantly in their origins, nature, and purposes. The Bible teaches that humans are created by God and can choose to follow Him, whereas evil spirits are fallen angels that seek to oppose God's will and lead people astray.
