The student effectively covers the key purposes of the tabernacle, using relevant biblical references to support their points. The answer could be strengthened by incorporating a bit more emphasis on the importance of the sacrificial system within the tabernacle as a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate sacrifice for sin. Additionally, connecting the tabernacle to Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of God dwelling among His people would have deepened the theological reflection."
