## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" (Greek: υἱός τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, huios tou anthrōpou) on several occasions. This title is significant because it reveals Jesus' understanding of his own identity, role, and mission.

The phrase "Son of Man" has its roots in Hebrew scripture, specifically in Daniel 7:13-14, where a divine being is described as the "son of man" who comes to receive dominion over all nations. This passage is often interpreted as a prophetic reference to the Messiah, the anointed one sent by God.

In Jesus' usage, the title "Son of Man" has several connotations:

1. Humanity: By calling himself the "Son of Man," Jesus emphasizes his humanity and solidarity with humanity. He identifies with us in our weaknesses, sufferings, and mortality.
2. Messianic identity: The term "Son of Man" was a common way to refer to the Messiah or the anointed one sent by God (Daniel 7:13-14). Jesus' use of this title underscores his claim to be the long-awaited Messiah, who would bring salvation to humanity.
3. Divine authority: In Daniel 7:13-14, the "son of man" is given dominion over all nations and has a heavenly authority. Jesus' use of this title suggests that he, as the Son of Man, has been given divine authority by God, which he exercises in his teachings, miracles, and ultimately, on the cross.
4. Eschatological significance: The phrase "Son of Man" is often used in apocalyptic literature (e.g., Daniel 7) to describe a figure who will appear at the end of time to bring judgment or salvation. Jesus' use of this title implies that he is not only the Messiah but also the one who brings about the ultimate reckoning, separating light from darkness, good from evil.
5. Connection to God: The "Son of Man" in Daniel 7:13-14 is described as approaching God and receiving dominion over all nations. Jesus' use of this title suggests that he has a direct relationship with God, is sent by God, and will ultimately return to God.

In summary, when Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man," he is proclaiming his identity as the Messiah, emphasizing his humanity and divine authority, and pointing to his role in bringing about the ultimate judgment and redemption.
