The student has effectively connected Jesus' use of this title to its Hebrew scriptural roots, emphasizing his humanity, Messianic identity, divine authority, eschatological significance, and his unique relationship with God. The answer is doctrinally sound and demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications of Jesus' self-designation as the \"Son of Man.\" Great job!"
