  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" in the context of His identity and mission. They made strong connections to Daniel 7 and explained the implications of this title in relation to Jesus' humanity, messianic identity, divine authority, eschatological significance, and connection to God. However, the student could have tied these points back more directly to the central theme of Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, as emphasized in the reference answer."
