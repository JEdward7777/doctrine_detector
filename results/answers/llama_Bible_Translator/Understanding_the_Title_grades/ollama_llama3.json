  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response provides a solid foundation in understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\". The writer correctly identifies that the title emphasizes Jesus' humanity and divine authority, and highlights his role as the Messiah. Additionally, the response effectively connects the concept to Jesus' mission and ultimate redemption.\n\nHowever, there are some areas for improvement:\n\n* While the response touches on the eschatological significance of the phrase \"Son of Man\", it could delve deeper into this aspect.\n* The writer's summary at the end is a good attempt, but it could be more concise and focused on the main points.\n* There is an opportunity to explore more fully how Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" relates to our faith and its implications for our understanding of salvation and redemption.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\", but could benefit from further development and connection to its implications for our faith."
