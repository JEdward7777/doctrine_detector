It effectively expands on the understanding of Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity, in line with Christian teachings. However, the response could have further emphasized the redemptive aspect of Jesus' identity as the 'Son of Man' in relation to the salvation of humanity."
