It effectively explains the implications of this title for our faith, highlighting Jesus' unique role as the Messiah and His dual nature as fully human and fully divine. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man.\" Great job!"
