  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" within a Christian worldview, highlighting His dual nature as fully human and fully divine, His role as the Messiah, and His connection to humanity. The explanation is detailed, well-supported with biblical references, and effectively addresses the concerns regarding the implications for our faith. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie back how Jesus' dual nature relates to our faith and salvation, to further strengthen the connection for readers."
