## Answer given by [llama Bible Translator](../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
As a Christian Bible translator, I'd like to provide an accurate answer based on the biblical text.

According to the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, God pronounces various consequences on ungodly people. Here are some examples:

1. Wrath and judgment (Romans 2:5-8; Psalm 94:1-2): God warns of His wrath and judgment against those who reject Him and live according to their sinful desires.
2. Destruction and ruin (Deuteronomy 28:15-68; Isaiah 24:4-6): The Bible describes the consequences of disobedience as destruction, ruin, and devastation.
3. Eternal separation from God (Matthew 25:41, 46; Revelation 20:11-15): Jesus teaches that those who reject Him will face eternal separation from God's presence and glory.
4. Torment in hell (Mark 9:43-49; Luke 16:19-26): The Bible describes hell as a place of torment and suffering for those who refuse to repent and trust in Christ.
5. Death and spiritual death (Ezekiel 18:20; Romans 6:23): The consequences of sin include physical death and spiritual death, which is separation from God's life and light.

It's essential to note that these consequences are not limited to the ungodly, but are also applicable to all humanity. Every person is born with a sinful nature (Romans 3:23), and the Bible teaches that all have fallen short of God's glory (Romans 3:23).

However, as a Christian, I must emphasize the incredible news that Jesus Christ came to save sinners from these consequences. Through faith in Him, we can experience eternal life, forgiveness, and restoration with God.
