4. Zechariah 14:5 - In a vision of the Messiah's return, God is referred to as the "Holy One of Israel" (Zechariah 14:5), connecting His holiness to Israel's redemption.

New Testament:

1. Matthew 1:20 - The angel Gabriel addresses Joseph in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy One" (Matthew 1:20).
2. Luke 4:25-27 - Jesus quotes Isaiah's words about the "Holy One of Israel" during His Sermon on the Mount (Luke 4:25-27), highlighting God's concern for the oppressed and marginalized.
