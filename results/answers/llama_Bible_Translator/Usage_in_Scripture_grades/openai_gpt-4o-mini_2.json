The specific examples given from both Testaments demonstrate how the term is tied to themes of moral purity, righteousness, justice, and divine authority. The focus on Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament highlights His unique role and divinity, further reinforcing the authority and relationship of Jesus as seen in the New Testament. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern while incorporating insights from a Christian worldview."
