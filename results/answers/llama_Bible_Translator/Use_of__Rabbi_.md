A great question!

In the New Testament, we see that both John the Baptist and Jesus Christ were referred to as "Rabbi" (Hebrew: רַבִּי, "my master") in different contexts.

**John the Baptist:** In John 3:26-27, it is written that people believed John the Baptist was the Messiah because he baptized with a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. The Jewish leaders asked him if he was the Christ (Messiah), and John replied by pointing to Jesus: "One who stands among you—a man named John—has been baptizing, but you have no idea what this is like. I baptize with water, but he baptizes with the Holy Spirit." Here, John the Baptist is referred to as "Rabbi" (Matthew 3:2; Mark 1:28).

**Jesus:** Jesus was often addressed as "Rabbi" by those who came to hear him teach. For example:

* In John 1:49, a Pharisee named Nathanael exclaimed, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!" when he saw Jesus.
* In Matthew 22:16, the Pharisees asked Jesus about paying taxes to Caesar. Jesus replied, "Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius, and he asked, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?" When they told him it was Caesar's, Jesus said, "Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give back to God what belongs to God." Then the Pharisees, trying to trap him, asked, "Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?" Jesus replied, "Bring me a silver coin used for paying the temple tax. And let her ask you, 'Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?' Then give her the same answer." When they brought him the coin, he asked them again, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?" They said, "Caesar's." Then Jesus said to them, "Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and give back to God what belongs to God." This exchange highlights Jesus' teaching authority as "Rabbi" (Matthew 22:16).

In summary, John the Baptist was referred to as "Rabbi" by some who recognized his role as a spiritual leader. Jesus Christ, on the other hand, was addressed as "Rabbi" by those who sought his teaching and wisdom, recognizing him as the Messiah and the Son of God.

May we seek to follow both John's example of pointing to Jesus (John 1:26-27) and Jesus' teachings on how to live for God's glory!
