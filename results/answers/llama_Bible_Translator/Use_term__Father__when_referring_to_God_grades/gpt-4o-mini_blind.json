  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful perspective on the use of the term \"Father\" when referring to God, highlighting potential misunderstandings and suggesting alternative terms. While it is important to consider avoiding confusion and barriers to understanding, the response falls short in emphasizing the doctrinal significance of God as Father within the Christian faith. A stronger emphasis on the Scriptural basis and theological implications of addressing God as \"Father\" would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
