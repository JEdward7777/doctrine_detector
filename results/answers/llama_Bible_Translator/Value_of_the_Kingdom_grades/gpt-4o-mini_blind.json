  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive list of parables Jesus used to describe the value of the Kingdom of God. The explanations are clear and demonstrate a good understanding of the teachings behind each parable. The inclusion of additional parables such as the Parable of the Net and the Parable of the Good Samaritan shows a thorough knowledge of Jesus' teachings. The only improvement would be to connect the parables more explicitly to the central message of the Kingdom of God as presented in the gospel accounts. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful response."
