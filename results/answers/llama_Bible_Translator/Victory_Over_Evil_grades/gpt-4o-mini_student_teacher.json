However, the reference answer specifically highlights the promise regarding one of Eve's descendants (referring to the Messiah) defeating Satan completely and crushing his power forever. While the student's answer covers multiple promises and aspects related to Satan's defeat, the core promise highlighted in the reference answer is missing. The response could have been enhanced by focusing on and emphasizing this central promise."
