## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
According to the Bible, God gives several promises regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan.

One such promise can be found in Revelation 20:1-6, which describes a future event known as the "millennium". During this period, Jesus Christ will reign on earth for 1,000 years, and Satan will be bound and unable to deceive the nations (Revelation 20:2-3). At the end of the millennium, Satan will be released from his prison and will attempt to deceive the nations once again, but he will be defeated by God's judgment (Revelation 20:7-10).

Another promise is found in Hebrews 2:14-15, where it says that Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil. This verse indicates that Satan's power and influence over humanity have been broken through Christ's redemptive work.

In addition, John 12:31 and Luke 11:21-22 reveal that Jesus came to destroy the devil's stronghold on human hearts. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus has freed humanity from the dominion of darkness and sin (Colossians 1:13).

Furthermore, 2 Corinthians 4:3-4 states that God will ultimately shine forth the light of His gospel in the faces of those who believe, which will ultimately lead to Satan's downfall.

Lastly, Revelation 12:7-9 speaks about a great war between God and Satan, where God wins and casts Satan down from heaven. This event marks the beginning of Satan's ultimate defeat, which will be completed when Jesus returns at the end of time (Revelation 20:11-15).

In summary, God has given several promises regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan, including the binding of Satan during the millennium, the destruction of his works through Christ's redemptive work, the breaking of his stronghold on human hearts, and the final war between God and Satan.
