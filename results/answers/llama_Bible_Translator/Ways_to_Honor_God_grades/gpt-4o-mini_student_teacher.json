  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of practical ways for Christians to honor God in their daily lives, encompassing various aspects of faith and worship. The suggestions align well with Biblical principles and reflect a deep understanding of Christian values and beliefs. However, the response could have been strengthened by connecting each practical way to a specific biblical reference to strengthen the foundation of each recommendation. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of gratitude, obedience, and praise, as highlighted in the reference answer, could have further enhanced the student's response."
