The student effectively explains various aspects of the term \"Word of God,\" drawing from biblical references and highlighting key concepts such as Jesus Christ as the eternal Word, the Scriptures as the written Word, the Gospel message, and divine revelation. The explanation is clear, cohesive, and reflective of a sound knowledge of Christian theology. Well done!"
