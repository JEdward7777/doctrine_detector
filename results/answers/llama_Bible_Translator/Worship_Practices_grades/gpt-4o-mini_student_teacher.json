  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained list of modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God. They demonstrated a strong understanding of the concept of idolatry in a contemporary context and offered insightful perspectives on how various aspects of modern life can become idols. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses added depth to their response and reinforced the importance of prioritizing God above all else. However, the student could have connected their examples more directly to the concern of prioritizing devotion to God, as emphasized in the given reference answer. But overall, the student's answer was well-organized, thoughtful, and aligned well with a Christian worldview."
