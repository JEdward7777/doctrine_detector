What a great question!

The Bible teaches that human beings were created by God to have a relationship with Him, and to worship Him alone (Isaiah 43:21, Jeremiah 10:6-7). This is because God is the Creator and Sustainer of all things, and He is worthy of all praise and adoration. As Psalm 100:3 says, "Know that the Lord, he is God. It is he who has made us, not we ourselves; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture."

In Genesis 1-2, we read about the creation of humanity in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27). This means that humans were created to reflect God's character and nature, and to have a personal relationship with Him. Worshiping God is not just an optional activity; it is a fundamental aspect of being human.

Now, about false gods...

The Bible consistently teaches that worshiping anything other than the one true God is idolatry (Deuteronomy 4:16-18, Psalm 97:7). False gods are idols that people create or worship in place of the one true God. This includes not only physical idols like statues and images but also abstract concepts like money, power, or self-will.

In the Old Testament, Israel was repeatedly warned against idolatry (Deuteronomy 5:6-7, 1 Kings 11:4-8). The prophets condemned idol worship as a rejection of God's sovereignty and an affront to His covenant with Israel. In the New Testament, Jesus warned against making idols out of things like money, status, or even one's own ego (Matthew 6:24-34, Luke 12:15).

The Bible says that false gods are nothing more than "nothing" or "nothingness" (Deuteronomy 4:35, Psalm 115:3-8). They have no power, wisdom, or ability to deliver (Psalm 135:15-18). God alone is the one who can provide real satisfaction, fulfillment, and redemption.

So, why were people created to worship God? Because God is the one true God, worthy of all praise and adoration. And what about false gods? Well, they are nothing more than empty idols that cannot deliver on their promises or satisfy our deepest needs.

May we be inspired by the psalmist's words: "I will exalt you, Lord; I will praise your name, for you alone are holy. All nations will come and say, 'He is righteous'; all who are incensed against him shall be ashamed, when they see the work of his hand" (Psalm 111:9-10).
