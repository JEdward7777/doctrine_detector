  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer with references to Biblical passages. They accurately explained why people were created to worship God and elaborated on the concept of false gods as idols. The response effectively highlights the importance of worshiping the true God to avoid idolatry. The incorporation of both Old and New Testament references demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on this topic. Great job!"
