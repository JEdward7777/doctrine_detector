  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer on the concept of zeal in Christian teachings. They incorporated relevant biblical references and examples to support their explanation. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific concern raised about understanding the biblical context of zeal for proper application in a believer's life. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of aligning zeal with biblical truth and discernment could have enhanced the theological depth of the response."
