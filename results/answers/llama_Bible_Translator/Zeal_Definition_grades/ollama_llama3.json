  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian zeal, accurately defining it as a passionate commitment to serving God and advancing His kingdom. The writer's description of biblical examples, such as Isaiah, Paul, and the early church in Acts, effectively illustrates the concept of zeal and its importance in Christian life. However, to achieve a perfect score, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical context and nuances of zeal, particularly addressing the concern that understanding the biblical context is essential for proper application.\n\nThe given answer provides a good foundation but lacks depth and specificity, which is where the graded response excels. The additional information about spiritual intensity, fervent prayer and worship, and missional focus adds richness to the concept of Christian zeal, making it more comprehensive and relatable. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern by providing a detailed understanding of biblical zeal and its significance in the life of a believer."
