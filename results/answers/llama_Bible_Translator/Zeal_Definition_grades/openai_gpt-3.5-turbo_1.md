## [Answer](../Zeal_Definition.md) by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
In the context of Christian teachings, "zeal" refers to a strong and intense passion or enthusiasm for serving God and advancing His kingdom. It's often described as a burning desire to do God's will and to spread the Gospel.

The Bible teaches that zeal is an essential quality for followers of Jesus Christ. In fact, the Apostle Paul writes in Romans 10:2, "For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge." Here, Paul notes that some people had a strong desire to serve God, but their understanding of Him was incomplete or misguided.

In Christian theology, zeal is often linked with the concept of "righteous jealousy" (Exodus 20:5; Deuteronomy 4:24). This refers to God's intense passion for His own glory and His people's worship. When we have a sense of zeal, we're emulating this quality in our relationship with Him.

Some key characteristics of Christian zeal include:

1. Passionate commitment: Zeal is not just intellectual assent or lukewarm involvement; it's a deep emotional investment in serving God.
2. Spiritual intensity: Zealous Christians are marked by a sense of urgency and priority, recognizing that time is short and eternity is at stake.
3. Fervent prayer and worship: Those with zeal often demonstrate their devotion through fervent prayer, praise, and sacrifice.
4. Missional focus: Zeal drives individuals to share the Gospel and make disciples, as they recognize the need for others to know Jesus Christ.

Examples of biblical figures who exemplified Christian zeal include:

* The prophet Isaiah, who was deeply grieved by Israel's spiritual complacency (Isaiah 1:2-4)
* The Apostle Paul, who risked his life to spread the Gospel and establish churches throughout the Mediterranean world
* The early church in Acts 2:42-47, where believers devoted themselves to prayer, fellowship, and witnessing

In summary, Christian zeal is a fervent passion for serving God and advancing His kingdom. It's characterized by passionate commitment, spiritual intensity, fervent prayer and worship, and a missional focus on spreading the Gospel.
