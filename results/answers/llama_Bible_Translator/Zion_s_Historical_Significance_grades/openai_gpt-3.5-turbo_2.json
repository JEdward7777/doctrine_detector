It effectively addresses the concern by expanding on the historical and religious importance of Mount Zion, demonstrating a strong understanding of its connection to key figures in Scripture. The response could be enhanced by directly referencing the term \"stronghold\" and incorporating it into the explanation for further clarity and cohesiveness."
