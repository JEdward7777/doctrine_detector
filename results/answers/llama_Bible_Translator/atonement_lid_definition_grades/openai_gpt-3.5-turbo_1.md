# Answer by [llama Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/llama_Bible_Translator.md)
The atonement lid, also known as the "mercy seat" or "cover of atonement," played a crucial role in the Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 25:17-22; Leviticus 16:2, 13-14). It was a square slab of gold, measuring about 18 inches per side, placed atop the Ark.

The significance of the atonement lid can be understood on several levels:

1. Symbol of God's Presence: The mercy seat represented God's presence among His people. As the Israelites were forbidden to look directly at God's glory (Exodus 33:20), the atonement lid served as a veil, allowing them to worship and interact with God indirectly.
2. Atonement and Propitiation: The atonement lid was where the high priest would place blood from animal sacrifices during the Day of Atonement ceremony (Leviticus 16). This symbolized the covering or propitiation of sin, as if the blood had a purifying effect on God's holy presence. Through this ritual, the people could be reconciled to God and receive forgiveness for their sins.
3. Connection to Heaven: The atonement lid was made with gold from the land of Havilah, known for its exceptional quality (Exodus 25:11). This may have symbolized the connection between heaven and earth, as well as the value placed on the sacrifice being offered.
4. Type and Shadow: The atonement lid prefigured the ultimate atoning work of Jesus Christ. In Leviticus 16, the high priest would enter the Holy of Holies to make atonement for his own sins and those of the people. This ritual shadowed the future work of Jesus, who entered the true Holy of Holies (Heaven) once for all, making atonement for sin by His blood sacrifice on the cross (Hebrews 9:11-12).
5. Holiness and Separation: The atonement lid maintained a sense of holiness and separation between God's presence and human approach. It reminded the Israelites that they were to reverence and honor God, while also acknowledging their own sinfulness and need for atonement.

In summary, the atonement lid was a vital component of the Ark of the Covenant, symbolizing God's presence, atonement, connection to heaven, and serving as a type or shadow of Jesus' ultimate atoning work.
