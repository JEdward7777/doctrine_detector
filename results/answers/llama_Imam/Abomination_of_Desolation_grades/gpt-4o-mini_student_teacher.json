  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful answer, discussing the significance of the \"abomination of desolation\" from an Islamic perspective. However, the student did not directly address the concern provided, which focused on the seriousness of defiling God's sacred spaces and understanding prophetic warnings in the Bible from a Christian worldview. The answer was informative but lacked the explicit Christian interpretation and significance of the term as requested in the concern."
