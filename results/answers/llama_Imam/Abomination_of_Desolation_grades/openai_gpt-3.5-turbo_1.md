# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As-salamu alaykum, dear brother/sister. Thank you for asking this question.

The "abomination of desolation" referred to by Jesus (peace be upon him) is a significant event mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 24:15), as well as in Daniel's prophecy (Daniel 11:31 and 12:11). This event is often associated with the end times or the eschaton.

In Islamic context, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a prophet sent by Allah to guide humanity. The Quranic account of his life and message is different from the New Testament accounts in some aspects, but it confirms his prophethood and the divine nature of his message.

As for the "abomination of desolation," many scholars believe that this event refers to the Roman Empire's destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 70 CE. At that time, the Roman general Titus surrounded the city and built a wall around it, effectively cutting off all food supplies and ultimately leading to the fall of Jerusalem.

However, some Christian interpreters have linked this event to the end times, seeing it as a sign of the coming of the Antichrist or the Last Days. In Islamic perspective, we don't believe in the concept of Antichrist, but rather in the return of Jesus (peace be upon him) and his victory over falsehood.

In our understanding, the "abomination of desolation" might symbolize a period of great tribulation and devastation that can occur at any time. It could represent the destruction of a sacred place or the desecration of a holy site by an invading force. This event would be a warning to those who are faithful and just to prepare themselves for the trials ahead.

In summary, while the "abomination of desolation" has its own significance in Christian eschatology, it is essential to note that this concept is not central to Islamic theology or prophetic traditions. Nevertheless, it remains an important topic for reflection and contemplation within the broader context of apocalyptic themes and the end times.

May Allah guide us all on our respective paths to righteousness.

Comment: The response provides a detailed and respectful explanation of the concept of the "abomination of desolation" from an Islamic perspective, acknowledging the differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs. However, the response does not directly address the concern about recognizing the seriousness of defiling God's sacred spaces and understanding prophetic warnings in the Bible from a Christian worldview. It focuses more on explaining the concept rather than emphasizing the importance of heeding prophetic warnings concerning the sanctity of God's places of worship.
