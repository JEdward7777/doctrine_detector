## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Sister, I'm happy to help clarify the concept of "unfaithful" in the context of Islamic marriage.

In Islam, a Muslim is expected to be faithful and loyal to their spouse. The Arabic term for this is "nusuk," which refers to the covenant or bond between a husband and wife. This bond is considered sacred, and any act that violates it is considered adultery (zina) and is strictly forbidden in Islam.

In terms of marriage, being "unfaithful" means engaging in any form of intimate relationship outside of one's marriage, including physical intimacy with someone else. This includes not only sexual relationships but also emotional attachments or romantic connections.

As per the Quranic verse (4:34), a Muslim is expected to keep their covenant with their spouse and maintain a strong bond of love, compassion, and loyalty. Any betrayal of this trust can lead to serious consequences, including divorce and even social exclusion.

In Islamic teachings, the concept of "unfaithfulness" is not limited to physical adultery but also extends to emotional infidelity or any behavior that undermines the sanctity of one's marriage. As such, it is essential for Muslims to prioritize their marital vows and maintain a strong bond with their spouse, free from any form of disloyalty.

May Allah guide us all in maintaining strong, faith-based marriages and keeping our covenants pure and untainted!
