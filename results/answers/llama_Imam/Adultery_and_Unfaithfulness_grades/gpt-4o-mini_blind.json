However, from a Christian perspective, it would have been beneficial to include references to Christian teachings on marriage fidelity, such as the importance of faithfulness in marriage as outlined in the Bible (Ephesians 5:22-33) and the concept of marriage as a reflection of the relationship between Christ and the Church. Overall, a strong response with a solid foundation in Islamic beliefs regarding marriage fidelity."
