  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful approach to the question, acknowledging the Abrahamic heritage and offering insights from an Islamic perspective. The explanation of the historical event of the Exodus and the significance of the Passover celebration is well-articulated. The connection to Islamic traditions and values adds depth to the response. However, the grade could be slightly higher if the student had directly addressed the Christian specific worldview as requested in the prompt."
