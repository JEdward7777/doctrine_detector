# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must approach this question with sensitivity and respect for the Abrahamic traditions. In Islam, we revere the Torah as a sacred text that contains guidance from Allah (God). While we may not observe the same practices or festivals, it is essential to understand the context and significance of the Passover celebration.

According to the Bible, Passover was commanded by Allah (in Arabic, "Allah") to commemorate the Israelites' liberation from slavery in Egypt. The story of Exodus 12:1-28 tells us that after ten plagues, Pharaoh finally agreed to let the Israelites go, but not before they had to take their own livestock and leave quickly. This was a night of great urgency and fear.

Allah instructed Moses to tell the Israelites to mark their doorposts with the blood of a lamb (Exodus 12:7-8), symbolizing the protection from the angel of death that passed over each household. Those who did not follow this command were struck down, while those who obeyed were spared.

The Passover celebration was instituted as an annual reminder of this miraculous event, where Allah saved His chosen people from slavery and oppression. The festival involved sacrificing a lamb (or later, a goat), eating matzah (unleavened bread) to remember the haste in which they left Egypt, and sharing a meal with family and friends.

In Islamic understanding, Passover is seen as a testament to Allah's power and mercy. We recognize that the Israelites' liberation from slavery was a divine intervention, just as our own prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent by Allah to guide humanity.

While Muslims do not celebrate Passover or observe similar festivals, we do commemorate important events in our faith, such as Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. These celebrations remind us of the blessings and mercy of Allah, and serve as a connection to our shared Abrahamic heritage.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response provides a detailed and respectful perspective on the significance of Passover from an Islamic viewpoint, acknowledging the importance of remembrance in religious traditions. The emphasis on Allah's intervention and mercy in the Exodus story aligns with Christian understanding of God's deliverance. However, the response could further connect the concept of remembrance to the Christian faith tradition and provide additional insights from a Christian-specific worldview to enhance the connection between the two Abrahamic religions.
