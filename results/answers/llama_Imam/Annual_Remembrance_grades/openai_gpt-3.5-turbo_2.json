However, the focus on Islamic beliefs and practices, while informative, may overshadow the Christian perspective and the importance of remembrance specific to the Christian faith. The response could have further emphasized the parallel concept of remembrance in Christianity and connected it more directly to the significance of Passover for Christians."
