However, it did not directly address the importance of remembrance in the Christian faith, which was the specified concern. Additionally, while the response highlighted the divine intervention and mercy of Allah in the context of Passover, it could have further emphasized the role of remembrance and celebration as a way to honor and acknowledge God's actions in the lives of believers."
