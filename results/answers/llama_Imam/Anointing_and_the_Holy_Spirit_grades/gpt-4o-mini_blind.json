While the effort to make connections between the two religions is appreciated, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective. It fails to clearly articulate the distinctiveness of the Holy Spirit as the third person of the Holy Trinity in Christian theology, and how the indwelling of the Holy Spirit is not merely about receiving messages or guidance, but about God's presence and empowerment in believers' lives. The focus should have been on the unique aspects of the Christian belief regarding the Holy Spirit rather than attempting to equate it with Islamic concepts."
