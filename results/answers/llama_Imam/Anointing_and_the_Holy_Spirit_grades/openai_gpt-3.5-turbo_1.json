The discussion is clear and respectful in comparing the two perspectives. However, it could be strengthened by more direct references to specific scriptural passages in both the Bible and Islamic texts to further support the points made. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to emphasize more explicitly the unique roles of the Holy Spirit in Christianity as compared to Islamic beliefs."
