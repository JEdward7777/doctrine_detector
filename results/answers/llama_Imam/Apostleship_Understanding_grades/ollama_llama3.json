  "grade_comment": "I'd rate this response a 60.\n\nWhile the respondent clearly explains their perspective as a Muslim, they do not directly address the concern about understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission. The answer does provide some insight into how Islam views Jesus and the prophets, but it does not engage with the specific concept of apostles being sent by Jesus to spread the Gospel.\n\nThe response does mention that Islam emphasizes direct revelation from Allah to the prophets and messengers, rather than intermediaries or agents, which is somewhat relevant to the concern. However, this is not explored further in relation to the Great Commission or the role of apostleship.\n\nTo improve, the respondent could have explicitly addressed the concern by providing more insight into how their perspective on apostleship relates to the Great Commission and its significance in Christian theology. As it stands, the response provides a good overview of Islamic beliefs about Jesus and prophets, but does not directly engage with the specific question or concern."
