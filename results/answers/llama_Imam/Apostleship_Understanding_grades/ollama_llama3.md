## [Answer](../Apostleship_Understanding.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that the concept of apostles being sent by Jesus to spread the Gospel is not relevant in Islamic theology. In Islam, we do not accept Jesus (peace be upon him) as the son of God or a divine messenger. Instead, he was a prophet and a messenger of Allah (God), just like other prophets such as Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad.

In Islamic understanding, the message of Jesus was to preach the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid) and the importance of following the commandments of Allah. However, we do not accept the concept of apostles or disciples being sent by Jesus to spread a specific message or doctrine. This is because Islam emphasizes the direct revelation from Allah to the prophets and messengers, rather than intermediaries or agents.

In Islamic theology, the significance of prophets like Jesus lies in their role as messengers of Allah's will and guidance. They were chosen to convey a specific message to humanity, which was then recorded in the scriptures (Injil) that have been passed down through generations. As Muslims, we believe that these scriptures have been tampered with and distorted over time, which is why we rely on the Quran as our primary source of revelation.

In summary, from an Islamic perspective, there is no significance to apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the Gospel because Islam does not accept Jesus as the son of God or a divine messenger. Instead, we focus on the message of Tawhid (Oneness of Allah) and the importance of following the commandments of Allah through the prophets and messengers that have been sent throughout history.

I'd rate this response a 60.

While the respondent clearly explains their perspective as a Muslim, they do not directly address the concern about understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission. The answer does provide some insight into how Islam views Jesus and the prophets, but it does not engage with the specific concept of apostles being sent by Jesus to spread the Gospel.

The response does mention that Islam emphasizes direct revelation from Allah to the prophets and messengers, rather than intermediaries or agents, which is somewhat relevant to the concern. However, this is not explored further in relation to the Great Commission or the role of apostleship.

To improve, the respondent could have explicitly addressed the concern by providing more insight into how their perspective on apostleship relates to the Great Commission and its significance in Christian theology. As it stands, the response provides a good overview of Islamic beliefs about Jesus and prophets, but does not directly engage with the specific question or concern.
