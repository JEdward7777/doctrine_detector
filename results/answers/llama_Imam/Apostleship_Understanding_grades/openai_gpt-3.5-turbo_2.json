From a Christian perspective, the apostles were specifically chosen and sent by Jesus to spread the Gospel message and establish the early church. The response provided from an Islamic viewpoint, while informative about Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and prophets, does not address the concern about the role of apostles in the Great Commission as understood in Christianity."
