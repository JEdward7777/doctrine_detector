However, from a Christian worldview centered on the Great Commission, the response does not address the significance of apostles being sent by Jesus to spread the Gospel. The explanation solely focuses on Islamic theology and beliefs, without engaging with the specific concern about the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission."
