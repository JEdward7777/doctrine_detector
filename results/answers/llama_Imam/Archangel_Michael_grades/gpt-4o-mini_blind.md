## [Answer](../Archangel_Michael.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, brother. The only angel referred to as an "archangel" in the Bible is Gabriel. He is mentioned three times in the New Testament: Luke 1:26-27, Daniel 8:15-16, and Revelation 12:7.

Gabriel is considered a messenger angel and is often associated with important revelations and messages from God. In Islamic tradition, Jibril (the Arabic equivalent of Gabriel) is also considered an important angel who brought the revelation of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

May Allah guide us all.

Comment: The answer correctly identifies Gabriel as the only archangel mentioned in the Bible, which is good. However, the inclusion of Islamic beliefs in the response deviates from a Christian worldview perspective. From a Christian standpoint, it is important to focus on the teachings and beliefs specific to Christianity when discussing biblical figures. It is essential to stay within the boundaries of Christian doctrine when answering questions related to the Bible.
