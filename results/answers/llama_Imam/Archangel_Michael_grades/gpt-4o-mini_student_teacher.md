## [Answer](../Archangel_Michael.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, brother. The only angel referred to as an "archangel" in the Bible is Gabriel. He is mentioned three times in the New Testament: Luke 1:26-27, Daniel 8:15-16, and Revelation 12:7.

Gabriel is considered a messenger angel and is often associated with important revelations and messages from God. In Islamic tradition, Jibril (the Arabic equivalent of Gabriel) is also considered an important angel who brought the revelation of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

May Allah guide us all.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer is factually incorrect as Gabriel is not the only angel referred to as an 'archangel' in the Bible, it is actually Michael. The response also includes information from Islamic tradition which is not relevant to the question asked. The student needs to improve their understanding of the biblical context and focus on the specific topic provided in the question.
