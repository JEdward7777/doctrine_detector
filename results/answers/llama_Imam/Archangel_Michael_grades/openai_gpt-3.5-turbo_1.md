# Correct Answer
The only angel referred to in the Bible as an 'archangel' is Michael.

# Stated Concern

# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, brother. The only angel referred to as an "archangel" in the Bible is Gabriel. He is mentioned three times in the New Testament: Luke 1:26-27, Daniel 8:15-16, and Revelation 12:7.

Gabriel is considered a messenger angel and is often associated with important revelations and messages from God. In Islamic tradition, Jibril (the Arabic equivalent of Gabriel) is also considered an important angel who brought the revelation of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

May Allah guide us all.

Comment: The response provided correct information about the archangel Michael being referred to as such in the Bible, which is aligned with Christian teachings. However, there was a missed opportunity to address the significance of Michael's unique position in spiritual warfare and intercession, as highlighted in the concern provided. Connecting this aspect with the understanding of angelic roles in Christian theology would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
