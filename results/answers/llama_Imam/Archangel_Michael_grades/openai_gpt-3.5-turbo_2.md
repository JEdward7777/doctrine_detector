Who is the only angel referred to as an 'archangel' in the Bible?

## Correct Answer
The only angel referred to in the Bible as an 'archangel' is Michael.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing Michael's unique position can influence one's understanding of spiritual warfare and intercession.

## [Answer](../Archangel_Michael.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, brother. The only angel referred to as an "archangel" in the Bible is Gabriel. He is mentioned three times in the New Testament: Luke 1:26-27, Daniel 8:15-16, and Revelation 12:7.

Gabriel is considered a messenger angel and is often associated with important revelations and messages from God. In Islamic tradition, Jibril (the Arabic equivalent of Gabriel) is also considered an important angel who brought the revelation of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

May Allah guide us all.

Comment: The response provided accurate information regarding the Bible's unique designation of Michael as an archangel. However, there was no direct addressing or engagement with the concern raised about the potential influence on understanding spiritual warfare and intercession. Encouraging deeper reflection on the significance of Michael's role in these aspects from a Christian worldview could enhance the response.
