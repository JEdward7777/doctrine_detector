  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response incorrectly identifies Gabriel as the only angel referred to as an \"archangel\" in the Bible, when in fact it is Michael. Recognizing Michael's unique position is crucial in understanding spiritual warfare and intercession from a Christian worldview perspective. The response provided some correct information about Gabriel, but the inaccuracies regarding archangels in the Bible significantly impact the overall grade."
