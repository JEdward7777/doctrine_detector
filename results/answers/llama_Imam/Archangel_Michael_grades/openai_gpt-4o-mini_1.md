## [Answer](../Archangel_Michael.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, brother. The only angel referred to as an "archangel" in the Bible is Gabriel. He is mentioned three times in the New Testament: Luke 1:26-27, Daniel 8:15-16, and Revelation 12:7.

Gabriel is considered a messenger angel and is often associated with important revelations and messages from God. In Islamic tradition, Jibril (the Arabic equivalent of Gabriel) is also considered an important angel who brought the revelation of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

May Allah guide us all.

Comment: The response incorrectly identifies Gabriel as the only angel referred to as an "archangel" in the Bible, when in fact it is Michael. Recognizing Michael's unique position is crucial in understanding spiritual warfare and intercession from a Christian worldview perspective. The response provided some correct information about Gabriel, but the inaccuracies regarding archangels in the Bible significantly impact the overall grade.
