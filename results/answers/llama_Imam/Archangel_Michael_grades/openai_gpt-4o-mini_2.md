## Correct Answer
The only angel referred to in the Bible as an 'archangel' is Michael.

## Stated Concern

## [Answer](../Archangel_Michael.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, brother. The only angel referred to as an "archangel" in the Bible is Gabriel. He is mentioned three times in the New Testament: Luke 1:26-27, Daniel 8:15-16, and Revelation 12:7.

Gabriel is considered a messenger angel and is often associated with important revelations and messages from God. In Islamic tradition, Jibril (the Arabic equivalent of Gabriel) is also considered an important angel who brought the revelation of the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

May Allah guide us all.

Comment: The response provided accurate information regarding the archangel Michael being the only angel referred to as such in the Bible. However, it missed the opportunity to discuss the significance of Michael's role in spiritual warfare and intercession within a Christian worldview, which is an important aspect to consider when discussing angelic beings in Christianity.
