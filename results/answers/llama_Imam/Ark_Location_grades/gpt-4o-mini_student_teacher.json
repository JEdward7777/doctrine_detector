  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God in the Tabernacle by accurately describing the location of the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies. The student also referenced relevant scripture and provided additional details about the cherubs and the mercy seat. However, the response could have been more focused on the specific location within the most holy place without the extra contextual information."
