## [Answer](../Ark_Location.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum, my brother.

In the Tabernacle of Moses, which was built according to the instructions given by Allah (SWT) to Musa (AS), the Ark of the Covenant had a special place. The Ark was placed inside the Holy of Holies, which was a small chamber within the larger Tabernacle structure.

The Holy of Holies was a sacred space that only the High Priest could enter once a year on Yom Kippur, after making specific offerings and purification rituals. Inside this chamber, the Ark of the Covenant stood upright, surrounded by four golden cherubs (angelic beings) who gazed downward at the Ark.

The exact location of the Ark within the Tabernacle was described in Exodus 25:22-23:

"Over the Ark of the Testimony there shall be a lid of gold. And thou shalt put the mercy seat on top of it, and in front of the mercy seat thou shalt make a flowering latticework all around it."

So, to summarize, the Ark of the Covenant was located inside the Holy of Holies within the Tabernacle, surrounded by the golden cherubs and covered with the lid of gold known as the "mercy seat".

May Allah (SWT) guide us in our understanding of His sacred scriptures.

Comment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the location of the Ark of the Covenant in the most holy place within the Tabernacle of Moses, as well as the significance of this sacred space and the role of the High Priest in entering it. The mention of the mercy seat and the cherubs surrounding the Ark adds depth to the understanding of the presence of God in the Tabernacle. The response could have further emphasized the holiness and significance of the most holy place as the dwelling of God's presence among His people.
