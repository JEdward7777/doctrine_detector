  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: While the student attempted to provide insights from an Islamic perspective, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview, which was requested in the question prompt. The grade is low as the response predominantly focuses on Islamic beliefs and interpretations rather than addressing the significance of the Ark of the Covenant specifically within the context of the Bible. The answer also includes theological differences between Islam and Christianity without adequately addressing the Christian significance of the Ark. A more accurate interpretation from a Christian perspective would have significantly improved the grade."
