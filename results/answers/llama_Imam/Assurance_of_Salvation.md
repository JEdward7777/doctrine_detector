## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we believe that the Quran gives us a unique perspective on Jesus (Isa) and his role in the story of God's revelation. In the Quran, Jesus is described as one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah, and he is accorded great respect and admiration.

In terms of assurance, the Quran affirms that those who believe in Jesus, along with other prophets, will be rewarded for their faith and good deeds. For example, Quran 3:48 states:

"And Allah will reward those who believe and do righteous deeds, among them those who follow the Prophet (Muhammad) - they shall have the reward of the Garden; they shall dwell there forever."

Similarly, Quran 5:82-83 says:

"Those who believed in Jesus and honored him on the day he was sent, with honor, are in a Book inscribed. And those who disbelieved after receiving the proof (of Jesus' prophethood) will have regret when they see the punishment - for they shall be struck by the sword of Allah."

In these verses, we can see that the Quran emphasizes the importance of faith and good deeds as the keys to salvation, regardless of one's beliefs about Jesus. It also warns against disbelieving after receiving proof (in this case, through Jesus' miracles and teachings).

Furthermore, in Islamic tradition, it is believed that those who believe in Jesus and follow his teachings, including the concept of the Messiahship (Ma'dh-iyyah), will be rewarded with a special place in Paradise. This is based on hadiths (narrations) from the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) himself, which describe the virtues of Jesus and his message.

In conclusion, while there may be differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs about Jesus' nature and role, the Quranic account of Jesus provides assurance to those who believe in him that their faith is rewarded by Allah. This is a fundamental aspect of Muslim-Christian dialogue and mutual understanding.
