It provides clear textual evidence from the Quran to support the claim that faith in Jesus and good deeds are rewarded. However, the answer does not address the specific concern of reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus from a Christian perspective. The conclusion could have explicitly connected the Quranic assurance with the Christian belief in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ."
