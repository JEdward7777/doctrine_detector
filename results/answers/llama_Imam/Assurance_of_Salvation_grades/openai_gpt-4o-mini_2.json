However, it does not fully address the concern of reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus as explained in the Christian perspective. While the Quran emphasizes faith and good deeds, the foundational Christian belief in salvation through faith in Jesus as the Son of God and His sacrifice on the cross for forgiveness of sins is not addressed adequately."
