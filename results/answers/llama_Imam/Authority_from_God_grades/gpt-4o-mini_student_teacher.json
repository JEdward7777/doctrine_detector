  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of divine authority in Islam and its significance in the life of a believer, there is a concern regarding the alignment with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer delves deeply into the concept of divine authority in Islam, covering various aspects such as unconditional surrender, guidance for righteous living, protection from evil, accountability, and unity and harmony. However, the reference answer focuses more on the concise definition of divine authority as the power and right that comes from God, guiding believers in their moral and spiritual decisions.\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and offers valuable insights from an Islamic perspective. However, since the concern specified adherence to the reference answer regarding the definition of divine authority, the student's answer, while informative, may be considered slightly off topic in this context, hence the deduction in points."
