  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThis response largely aligns with the given answer, correctly identifying \"divine authority\" as the power and right that comes from God, guiding believers in their moral and spiritual decisions. The additional information provided about the significance of divine authority in Islamic faith and practice further supports the understanding of this concept.\n\nThe concern about understanding divine authority helping believers discern God's will and maintain obedience is also well-addressed in this response. The author highlights the importance of recognizing divine authority in submitting to Allah's will, following His guidance, and striving for a life of righteousness. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the role of divine authority in the believer's faith journey.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the concept of divine authority and Christian theology. However, given the specified concern and answer, this response effectively addresses the key issue and provides relevant examples from Islamic faith and practice."
