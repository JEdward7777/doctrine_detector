  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good attempt at providing an overview of the biblical perspective on the authority of governing rulers. They referenced relevant passages such as Romans 13:1-7 and Titus 3:1, highlighting the importance of obeying civil authorities. However, there was a significant deviation from the Christian worldview when the student focused more on Islamic theology and governance concepts, such as khilafah, rather than solely focusing on the biblical perspective. Additionally, the response lacked a clear emphasis on the divine establishment of governing rulers as outlined in Romans 13:1-2. Overall, while the student showed an effort to engage with the topic, there was a need for a stronger connection to the specific concern from a Christian perspective."
