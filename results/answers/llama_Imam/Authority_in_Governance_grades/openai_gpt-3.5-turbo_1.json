  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough comparison between the biblical perspective on governing rulers and the Islamic perspective on governance, addressing the concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. The discussion on Romans 13 and the emphasis on the divine trust (amanah) in Islamic governance are well-explained. The response effectively integrates Christian and Islamic viewpoints while maintaining a respectful and informative tone."
