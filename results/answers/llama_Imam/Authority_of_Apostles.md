## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, dear brother in faith. The authority of the apostles is deeply tied to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly, as stated in the Quran. In fact, their prophethood is closely linked to their miraculous powers and the message they conveyed.

In the Quran, we read: "And indeed, We gave Musa (Moses) forty nights" (Quran 7:142). Here, Allah (swt) granted Moses a special authority, allowing him to perform miracles and communicate with His creation. Similarly, when Jesus (peace be upon him) was appointed as an apostle, he performed many miracles and preached boldly, as recorded in the Quran: "And [remember] when Allah will say, 'O Jesus, son of Maryam! Remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit'" (Quran 5:110).

The authority of the apostles is rooted in their prophethood, which was granted to them by Allah (swt) Himself. Their ability to perform miracles was a manifestation of that authority, demonstrating their closeness to Allah and His message. The miracles performed by the prophets were not mere magic tricks but rather signs from Allah, meant to confirm the truth of their message and guide humanity.

When Jesus preached boldly, he was exercising his prophetic authority, just as Moses did when he received the Ten Commandments from Allah. Their bold preaching was a natural extension of their prophethood, as they were commissioned by Allah (swt) to call people to righteousness and warn them of impending doom.

In conclusion, the authority of the apostles is inextricably linked to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. As we reflect on the lives of these great prophets, let us remember that their prophethood was not just a historical phenomenon but also a divine appointment, granting them the power to guide humanity towards righteousness and salvation.

May Allah (swt) guide us all to follow in their footsteps and may our faith be strengthened by the examples they set for us. Ameen.
