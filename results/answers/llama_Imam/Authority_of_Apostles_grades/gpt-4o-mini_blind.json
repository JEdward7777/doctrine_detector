The Quranic verses cited are not recognized as authoritative within Christian doctrine. The response fails to address the unique authority given to the apostles in the context of the New Testament and Jesus' commissioning of them in the Great Commission. It is important for the student to focus on presenting Christian teachings accurately when discussing matters of apostolic authority and miracles."
