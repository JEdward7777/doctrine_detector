The writer effectively connects the apostles' prophethood with their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly, highlighting the significance of these actions as signs from Allah (swt). The inclusion of Quranic verses adds credibility and depth to the discussion.\n\nHowever, some points could be improved:\n\n1. While the response correctly emphasizes the connection between prophethood and authority, it doesn't explicitly tie this concept back to Jesus' commissioning of the apostles in the New Testament. A more direct link would strengthen the argument.\n2. The writer might have also explored the implications of this divine empowerment for modern-day Christian ministry, providing a clearer call-to-action or application for readers.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid exploration of the concern and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts involved. With some refinement to address the above points, it could be even more effective!"
