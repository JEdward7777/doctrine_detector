## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, dear brother in faith. The authority of the apostles is deeply tied to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly, as stated in the Quran. In fact, their prophethood is closely linked to their miraculous powers and the message they conveyed.

In the Quran, we read: "And indeed, We gave Musa (Moses) forty nights" (Quran 7:142). Here, Allah (swt) granted Moses a special authority, allowing him to perform miracles and communicate with His creation. Similarly, when Jesus (peace be upon him) was appointed as an apostle, he performed many miracles and preached boldly, as recorded in the Quran: "And [remember] when Allah will say, 'O Jesus, son of Maryam! Remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit'" (Quran 5:110).

The authority of the apostles is rooted in their prophethood, which was granted to them by Allah (swt) Himself. Their ability to perform miracles was a manifestation of that authority, demonstrating their closeness to Allah and His message. The miracles performed by the prophets were not mere magic tricks but rather signs from Allah, meant to confirm the truth of their message and guide humanity.

When Jesus preached boldly, he was exercising his prophetic authority, just as Moses did when he received the Ten Commandments from Allah. Their bold preaching was a natural extension of their prophethood, as they were commissioned by Allah (swt) to call people to righteousness and warn them of impending doom.

In conclusion, the authority of the apostles is inextricably linked to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. As we reflect on the lives of these great prophets, let us remember that their prophethood was not just a historical phenomenon but also a divine appointment, granting them the power to guide humanity towards righteousness and salvation.

May Allah (swt) guide us all to follow in their footsteps and may our faith be strengthened by the examples they set for us. Ameen.

Grade: 85

Comment:
The response receives high marks for exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles, as specified in the concern. The writer effectively connects the apostles' prophethood with their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly, highlighting the significance of these actions as signs from Allah (swt). The inclusion of Quranic verses adds credibility and depth to the discussion.

However, some points could be improved:

1. While the response correctly emphasizes the connection between prophethood and authority, it doesn't explicitly tie this concept back to Jesus' commissioning of the apostles in the New Testament. A more direct link would strengthen the argument.
2. The writer might have also explored the implications of this divine empowerment for modern-day Christian ministry, providing a clearer call-to-action or application for readers.

Overall, the response provides a solid exploration of the concern and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts involved. With some refinement to address the above points, it could be even more effective!
