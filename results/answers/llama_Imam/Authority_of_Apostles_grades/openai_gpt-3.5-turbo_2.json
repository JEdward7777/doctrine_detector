The integration of Quranic verses to support the argument is well done, showcasing a deep understanding of both faith traditions. The response could have further emphasized the specific connection between Jesus empowering the apostles in the Christian context, but overall, it provides a thoughtful and insightful analysis reflecting on divine empowerment."
