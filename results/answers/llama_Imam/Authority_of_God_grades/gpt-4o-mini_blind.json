However, there are doctrinal discrepancies in equating the Islamic understanding of Allah's power over Jinn and angels directly with the Christian concept of Yahweh's authority over spiritual beings. The response could be improved by avoiding doctrinal equivalences between different faith traditions and focusing more on the unique aspects of Christian theology in relation to Yahweh's authority."
