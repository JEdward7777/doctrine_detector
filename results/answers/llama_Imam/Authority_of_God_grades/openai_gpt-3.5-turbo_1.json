The Islamic perspective was integrated smoothly, highlighting similar beliefs in Allah's authority over Jinn and angels. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern regarding deepening faith and trust in God's omnipotence. However, there could have been more explicit references to biblical verses or Islamic scriptures to further support the points made."
