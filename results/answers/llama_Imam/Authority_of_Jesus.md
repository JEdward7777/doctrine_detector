## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that I do not recognize Jesus as the King of the Jews or the son of God. In Islam, we believe in the prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him), but we reject the concept of his divinity and the notion that he is the king of the Jews.

However, if you're asking about the Christian perspective on this title, I can provide some insights. From a Christian perspective, the title "King of the Jews" is often seen as a reference to Jesus' authority over all creation. In this context, being called "King of the Jews" is not just a label for his ethnic or national identity but rather an expression of his universal kingship.

For Christians, Jesus' authority over all creation is rooted in his divine nature and his role as the Son of God. His title "King of the Jews" is seen as a declaration of his sovereignty over the entire world, including both Jew and Gentile (non-Jew). This title is often understood to be a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as Psalm 2:6-7, which speaks of a future king who will reign over all nations.

In this sense, Jesus' authority over all creation is not limited to his Jewish heritage or his relationship with the Israelites. Rather, it's seen as a universal kingship that transcends ethnic and national boundaries. This idea is reflected in New Testament passages such as Philippians 2:9-11, which describes Jesus as the one who has been given all authority in heaven and on earth.

It's important to note, however, that this Christian perspective is not shared by Muslims. In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a prophet sent by God, but we reject the idea of his divinity or universal kingship. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus' role was limited to guiding the Israelites and calling them back to monotheism, whereas Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the final prophet sent by God to guide humanity.
