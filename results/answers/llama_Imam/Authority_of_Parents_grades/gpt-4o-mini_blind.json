However, there was a lack of doctrinal correctness in attributing the concept of parental authority primarily to the Bible, rather than stating it as a universal principle established by God for all humanity. Additionally, there was a need for clearer distinction between the Islamic and Christian views, especially in terms of the foundational basis for parental authority. The answer could benefit from a deeper theological analysis and clarification of how each religion uniquely views parental authority within their respective worldviews."
