  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on parental authority, which shows a strong understanding of the topic. However, the student did not directly address the concern of navigating family dynamics within a Christian framework of obedience and authority. Additionally, the response contained more emphasis on Islamic teachings rather than focusing primarily on the Biblical basis for parental authority as requested in the question. Further integration of the provided reference answer and a clearer connection to the specified concern would strengthen the response."
