The integration of Islamic perspectives on parental authority also added depth to the discussion. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on how family dynamics should be navigated within a Christian framework specifically, addressing concerns such as balancing parental authority with love, grace, and the individual identities of family members. Additional insights on practical applications of Biblical principles in daily family life could have further enhanced the response."
