## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that the Psalms are part of the Christian scriptures, specifically the Old Testament of the Bible. While we Muslims respect the prophets and messengers mentioned in the Quran, our primary focus is on understanding the revelations sent to us through the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

That being said, the Psalms were written by various authors over a period of time. Some of the key figures involved in writing the Psalms include:

1. King David: He is often referred to as the "sweet psalmist of Israel" and is credited with writing many of the Psalms (Psalms 2-41, 51-65). As a king and a prophet, David was known for his poetic skills and his deep faith in God.
2. Asaph: He was a musician and a prophet who wrote several Psalms (Psalms 50, 73-83).
3. The Sons of Korah: This group of Levites were responsible for writing some of the Psalms (Psalms 42-49).
4. Moses: Some scholars believe that Moses may have written Psalm 90 and Psalm 91.
5. Other anonymous authors: Many of the Psalms do not attribute authorship to a specific individual, and it is unclear who wrote them.

It's worth noting that the Psalms were likely written over a period of several centuries, with some being written as early as the time of King David (around 1000 BCE) and others being written much later. The Psalms reflect a range of themes, from praise and worship to lamentation and petition, and offer insights into the spiritual lives of ancient Israelites.
