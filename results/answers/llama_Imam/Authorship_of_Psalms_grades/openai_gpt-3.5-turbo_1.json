  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies some key figures involved in writing the Psalms, such as King David and Asaph, but inaccurately includes Solomon as an author when there is no direct evidence attributing any Psalms to him. Additionally, the response overlooks the importance of recognizing authorship in enhancing understanding of the Psalms' messages and themes, which could deepen the analysis provided."
