  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the key figures involved in writing the Psalms, mentioning King David, Asaph, and the Sons of Korah, among others. However, it is lacking in accuracy as it does not mention Solomon as indicated in the provided answer. Recognizing the authorship of Psalms is important for understanding their context and themes, and while the response covers some key authors, it could be improved by including Solomon as well."
