However, there are inaccuracies in attributing the authorship of Psalms to figures like Solomon, who are not traditionally connected to the Psalms. Additionally, there is a lack of acknowledgment of the concern that recognizing the actual authorship of the Psalms can indeed enhance understanding of their messages and themes, which could have been elaborated on further."
