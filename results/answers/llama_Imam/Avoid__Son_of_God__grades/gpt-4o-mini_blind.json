  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the differing perspectives on the term \"Son of God\" in Christian and Islamic theology. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of using language that is clear and sensitive in cross-cultural dialogue. However, the student should have also highlighted the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the theological significance of Jesus as the Son of God within Christianity. Additionally, the response could have incorporated more specific references to biblical passages to support the explanation. Overall, while the answer shows a good understanding of the topic, there is room for improvement in providing a more nuanced and thorough analysis."
