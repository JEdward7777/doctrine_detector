  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response from an Islamic perspective, acknowledging the potential for misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures regarding the term \"Son of God.\" However, the recommended avoidance of the term may not fully align with a Christian worldview, which values accurately teaching and explaining theological concepts rather than avoiding them altogether. The student's answer demonstrates respect and understanding towards different faith traditions, but falls short of fully addressing the concern raised from a Christian perspective."
