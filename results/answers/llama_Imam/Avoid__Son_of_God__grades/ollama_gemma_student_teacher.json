The student acknowledges the importance of contextualizing the term within Christian theology while also highlighting the need for sensitivity towards different religious perspectives. The argument that avoidance can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings is well-presented. The student's suggestion of using alternative phrases to convey the Christian doctrine without promoting polytheism is insightful. Overall, this is a well-written and comprehensive response that addresses the concern appropriately from a Christian specific worldview."
