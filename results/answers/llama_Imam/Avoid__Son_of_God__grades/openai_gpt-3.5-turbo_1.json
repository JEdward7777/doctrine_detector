  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and respectful perspective on the use of the term \"Son of God\" in both Christian and Islamic theology. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of maintaining theological accuracy while considering the potential for misunderstanding in different cultural contexts. While the recommendation to avoid the term \"Son of God\" in certain translations is valid to prevent misconceptions, there could have been a more nuanced approach to addressing the concern about potential theological gaps. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian-Islamic dialogue but could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of how to bridge theological differences effectively."
