However, while it suggests avoiding the term in certain contexts to prevent potential misunderstandings, it may benefit from also emphasizing the need for deeper theological discussions and explanations to bridge any gaps in understanding. Balancing the importance of clarity with the opportunity for meaningful dialogue and teaching would enhance the response."
