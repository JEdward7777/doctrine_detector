However, it could do more to emphasize the importance of properly teaching and explaining the term rather than outright avoidance, especially in the context of engaging in dialogue and promoting understanding between different faiths. A balanced approach that includes both the caution of potential misunderstandings and the value of education could strengthen the argument presented."
