It is essential to find a balance between avoiding misunderstandings and addressing theological differences with respect and clarity. A more nuanced approach that includes careful teaching of the term's meaning through context and explanation would better address the concern raised about potential theological gaps and misunderstandings regarding Jesus' identity."
