They acknowledge the differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding rituals without compromising the Christian perspective on baptism. However, the response could be improved by delving deeper into the doctrinal significance of baptism in relation to topics such as regeneration, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the relationship between baptism and salvation. Additionally, it would have been beneficial for the student to reference specific New Testament passages that highlight the importance of baptism in the life of a Christian."
