Assalamu alaikum, my brother in faith,

Repentance and baptism are intricately connected in the New Testament. In Islam, we believe in Tawbah (repentance) as a means of seeking forgiveness from Allah (swt). Similarly, in Christianity, repentance is seen as a crucial step towards salvation.

In the New Testament, repentance is often linked with baptism as a way to demonstrate one's commitment to following Jesus Christ. When a person repents of their sins and turns to God, they are symbolically washed clean through the act of baptism (Matthew 3:11-12, Mark 1:4-5, Luke 3:3-7). This is not a physical cleansing, but rather a spiritual one, signifying the individual's desire to leave their old life behind and start anew.

In Islamic terms, repentance is similar to the concept of Tawbah. When a Muslim repents, they turn away from sin and towards Allah (swt), seeking His forgiveness and mercy. Similarly, in Christianity, when a person repents and is baptized, they are essentially saying, "I leave my old self behind and start anew with Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior."

However, there is an important distinction to make here. In Islam, we believe that Allah (swt) is the sole Judge of human actions and determines who will enter Paradise or Hellfire based on their deeds in this life. In Christianity, salvation is seen as a gift from God to those who accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.

In light of these differences, how does one relate repentance to baptism in a Christian context? To answer that, let us turn to the New Testament. Baptism is often presented as an act of obedience to Jesus' command, which is linked to salvation (Mark 16:15-16, Acts 2:38). When a person repents and turns to God through faith in Christ, they are symbolically washed clean through baptism, signifying their new life in Christ.

In summary, while there may be differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding repentance and salvation, the connection between repentance and baptism in the New Testament is clear. Repentance is seen as a crucial step towards salvation, and baptism is a tangible expression of that commitment to follow Jesus Christ.

May Allah (swt) guide us all on our spiritual journeys, and may we strive for righteousness and mercy.
