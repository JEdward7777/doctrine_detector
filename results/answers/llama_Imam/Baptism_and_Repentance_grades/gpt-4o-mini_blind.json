However, the answer predominantly focuses on comparing Islamic concepts with Christian ones, which may not fully address the specific question about the relationship between repentance and baptism in the New Testament. Additionally, there are doctrinal inaccuracies in equating Islamic Tawbah with Christian repentance and salvation, as the Christian understanding of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior is central and distinct from Islamic beliefs. More emphasis on the biblical passages and teachings related to repentance and baptism in the New Testament would have strengthened the response."
