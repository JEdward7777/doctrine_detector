  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comparison between Islamic and Christian beliefs on repentance and salvation, but it lacks a clear explanation of the relationship between repentance and baptism in the Christian context. The reference answer states that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism, which is a fundamental aspect the student failed to explicitly address. Additionally, the student's focus on Islamic beliefs, while interesting, diverts from the specific concern of understanding the Christian doctrine regarding repentance and baptism as presented in the New Testament. Furthermore, there was a lack of depth in discussing the theological significance of baptism as it relates to repentance in Christianity."
