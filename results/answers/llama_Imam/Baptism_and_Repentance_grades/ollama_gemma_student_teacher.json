They effectively explain the symbolic significance of baptism as a representation of spiritual rebirth and the importance of repentance as a prerequisite for salvation. The inclusion of references from the New Testament supports their claims. However, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly stating that repentance is a necessary prerequisite for baptism in Christian theology."
