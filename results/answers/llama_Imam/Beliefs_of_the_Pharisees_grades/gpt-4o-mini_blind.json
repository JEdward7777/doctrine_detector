The student accurately identifies and explains key elements of Pharisaic beliefs, such as physical resurrection, the afterlife, spiritual beings, and the understanding of Sheol and Gehenna. However, the answer is written from an Islamic perspective rather than a Christian one, which affects doctrinal correctness. It would be beneficial for the student to present the information from a Christian worldview, focusing on biblical references and teachings."
