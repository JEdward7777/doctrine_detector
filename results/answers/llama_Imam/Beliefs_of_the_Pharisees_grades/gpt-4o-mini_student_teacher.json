However, the student's response deviates significantly from the Christian-specific worldview, as the answer is presented from an Islamic perspective rather than a Christian one. The student should have focused on discussing the Pharisees' beliefs without incorporating Islamic beliefs and should have referenced Christian sources or biblical texts to support their points."
