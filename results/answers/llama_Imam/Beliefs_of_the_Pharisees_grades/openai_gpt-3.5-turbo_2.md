Salaam, my dear brother or sister in Islam. The Pharisees, as a Jewish sect during the time of Jesus (peace be upon him), had certain beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings. While our understanding of these matters may differ slightly due to the revelations we have received through the Quran and Hadith, I shall attempt to provide an overview of their perspectives.

1. Resurrection: The Pharisees believed in a physical resurrection of the dead, as recorded in Daniel 12:2-3. They believed that at the end of time, God would raise up all people who had ever lived, including those who had died and those still alive.
2. Afterlife: The Pharisees envisioned an afterlife where souls awaited judgment. This concept is mentioned in the Talmud (Shabbat 152b) and other Jewish texts. They believed that during this time, spirits of the dead could interact with the living, sometimes seeking justice or offering guidance (e.g., Num. R. 12:15).
3. Spiritual Beings: The Pharisees recognized various categories of spiritual beings, including angels (malakim) and demons (shedim). They believed that these beings played a role in shaping human destiny (Deut. 33:2-5, Ps. 104:4).
4. Demons and Evil Spirits: The Pharisees saw demons as malevolent forces sent by God to test humanity's faith (Job 1:6-12). They also believed that evil spirits could possess individuals, causing them to act in ways contrary to God's will (Lev. 26:16, Deut. 32:17).
5. Sheol and Gehenna: The Pharisees distinguished between two places for the dead: Sheol (the underworld) and Gehenna (a place of eternal torment). While some Jewish texts describe Sheol as a neutral realm where souls awaited judgment, the Pharisees viewed it more negatively, seeing it as a place where the wicked would be punished. Gehenna, on the other hand, was seen as an eternal fiery pit for those who rejected God's will (e.g., Matt. 5:22).

In conclusion, the Pharisees believed in a physical resurrection, an afterlife where souls awaited judgment, and various categories of spiritual beings. They saw demons as malevolent forces sent by God to test humanity's faith and recognized two places for the dead: Sheol and Gehenna.

May Allah guide us towards the truth and lead us to eternal peace. Ameen.
