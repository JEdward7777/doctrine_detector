  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated overview of how the term \"beloved\" is used in the New Testament letters to Christian churches, citing specific examples and demonstrating an understanding of its significance in expressing affection and close relationships within the Christian community. However, the student's response lacked a direct connection to the importance of love and unity among Christians as reflected in biblical teachings, which was a key concern in the grading criteria. While the student's background as a Muslim Imam provides an interesting perspective, the focus should have been more on the Christian worldview regarding love and unity based on biblical teachings."
