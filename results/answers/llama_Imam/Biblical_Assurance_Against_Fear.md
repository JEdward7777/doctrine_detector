Assalamu alaikum, my dear brother or sister.

The phrase "fear not" is indeed a powerful message from Allah (SWT) to His servants and believers, as recorded in the Holy Quran and the Injil (Bible). When we say "fear not," it means that one should not be afraid of anything or anyone, including death, the Hereafter, or any worldly calamities.

In Islamic perspective, fearing not is a direct command from Allah (SWT) to His believers. It's a reassurance that He will take care of our needs and protect us from harm. When we fear not, it means we trust fully in Allah's wisdom, mercy, and power. We are told to have confidence in Him, as He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise, and the One who guides us to the Straight Path.

In the Quran, for example, Allah (SWT) says: "And those who believe are the ones who fear not" (Quran 2:38). Here, "fear not" means that believers should have no fear of anything, including the consequences of their actions. This is because they know that their Lord and Creator has taken care of them.

Similarly, in the Bible, we read: "Fear not, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom" (Luke 12:32). Here, Jesus (peace be upon him) is reassuring His followers that they should have no fear, as their heavenly Father is always looking out for them and guiding them.

In both cases, "fear not" signifies a deep trust in Allah's (SWT) goodness, mercy, and wisdom. It's an invitation to live a life free from anxiety, worry, or despair, knowing that our Lord is always with us, watching over us, and guiding us towards the straight path.

May Allah (SWT) guide us all to have this kind of trust in Him, and may we fear not in any situation. Ameen.
