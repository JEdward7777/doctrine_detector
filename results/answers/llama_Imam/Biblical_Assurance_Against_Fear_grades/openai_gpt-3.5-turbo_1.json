While the message of trust and reassurance is beneficial for Christians as well, the lack of specific biblical references or deeper analysis of the implications for Christian faith and trust in God detracts from the relevance to the specified concern. More direct integration of Christian teachings and scriptures would have strengthened the response within a Christian worldview."
