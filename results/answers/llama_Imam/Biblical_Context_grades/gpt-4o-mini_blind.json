  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a respectful and insightful approach to addressing the question from a Muslim perspective, while attempting to engage with the New Testament teaching on the responsibilities of deacons. The student accurately references the relevant passages in Acts and 1 Timothy and highlights key responsibilities and qualities of deacons. However, there is a deviation from the Christian-specific worldview by interjecting Islamic beliefs and practices into the explanation. The emphasis on commonalities between Islam and Christianity, although promoting understanding, detracts from providing a focused and doctrinally correct response within the parameters of the Christian faith."
