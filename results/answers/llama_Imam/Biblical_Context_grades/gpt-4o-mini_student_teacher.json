  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, highlighting their role in serving and distributing resources within the Christian community. However, the student did not directly address the specified concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, which was the main focus of the question. The student did make connections to Islamic teachings on service and compassion, which shows an attempt at interfaith understanding. Overall, while the response was informative, it fell short in directly addressing the concern posed in the question."
