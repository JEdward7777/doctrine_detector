# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaykum (peace be upon you). As a Muslim Imam, I must acknowledge that my primary focus is on Islamic teachings and the Quran. However, as an exercise in interfaith understanding and respect for other Abrahamic traditions, I will provide an answer based on the New Testament.

In the New Testament, particularly in the book of Acts (6:1-6) and 1 Timothy (3:8-13), the responsibilities of deacons are described. Deacons, also known as "ministering servants" or "servant-leaders," played a crucial role in the early Christian community.

According to these passages, the primary responsibilities of deacons were:

1. Serving tables (Acts 6:2): Deacons were responsible for managing and distributing food, ensuring that all believers received their share.
2. Ministering to practical needs (Acts 6:3-4): They served as a support system, helping widows and orphans, as well as providing material assistance to those in need.
3. Managing the church's resources (1 Timothy 3:12): Deacons were entrusted with overseeing the distribution of goods and funds within the community.

In addition to these practical responsibilities, deacons were expected to possess certain qualities, such as:

1. Wisdom (Acts 6:3)
2. Integrity (1 Timothy 3:9-10)
3. Good reputation (1 Timothy 3:7)

These descriptions emphasize the importance of serving others, being a good example, and exercising wisdom in their roles.

In Islam, we have our own understanding of service to humanity, as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) teachings on charity, compassion, and social justice. While there may be differences in specific responsibilities or qualities expected of deacons compared to Islamic concepts like zakat (charity) and khidmah (service), I believe that both traditions share a common concern for serving others and building a more just society.

May Allah guide us all to serve His creation with compassion, wisdom, and integrity.
