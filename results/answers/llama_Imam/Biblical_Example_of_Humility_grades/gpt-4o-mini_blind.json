However, blending Islamic beliefs with Christian doctrine may lead to theological confusion. It's crucial to maintain doctrinal integrity and clarity when discussing figures from different faith traditions in a Christian-specific context. Further emphasis on the biblical example without interweaving Islamic beliefs would have been more appropriate."
