  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student made an effort to provide an example from the Bible that aligns with Islamic values, which shows a respectful approach to different faith traditions. However, the student deviated from the specific question of providing a biblical example of humility by discussing Jesus from the New Testament and Prophet Muhammad from Islamic tradition instead of focusing on a character directly from the Bible. The answer did not directly address the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. The student's response lacked depth and specificity in directly addressing the question asked."
