  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the concern and provides a relevant biblical example of humility in Christ Jesus. The student also acknowledges the Islamic perspective on humility and draws parallels between Christian and Islamic values. The inclusion of the Quranic and Islamic references enhances the credibility of the response. However, the response would benefit from a closer alignment with the provided reference answer, which suggests David as an example of humility."
