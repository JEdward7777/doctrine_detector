## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must acknowledge that the Quran and Hadith emphasize the importance of humility as a fundamental characteristic of a believer. However, I can try to provide an example from the Bible that aligns with Islamic values.

One notable example is Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), who was described in the Bible as being humble. In Philippians 2:5-8, it says:

"Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God as something to be exploited, but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross."

This passage highlights Jesus' willingness to surrender his divine privileges and take on human form, ultimately leading to his crucifixion. This selfless act is often seen as an example of humility.

In Islam, we believe that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent by Allah to guide humanity, and he exemplified humility throughout his life. He would often perform tasks considered beneath his dignity, such as serving his wives and companions, in order to demonstrate the importance of humility.

While there may be differences in interpretation between Islamic and Christian perspectives, I hope this example illustrates the value placed on humility in both traditions.

**Grade: 85/100**

**Comment:** 
The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the concern and provides a relevant biblical example of humility in Christ Jesus. The student also acknowledges the Islamic perspective on humility and draws parallels between Christian and Islamic values. The inclusion of the Quranic and Islamic references enhances the credibility of the response. However, the response would benefit from a closer alignment with the provided reference answer, which suggests David as an example of humility.
