  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of blamelessness and its application in Islamic tradition. The student correctly points out that the Quran does not explicitly use the concept of \"blamelessness\" in the classical Christian sense but highlights the idea of righteousness and obedience. \n\nThe inclusion of examples of Enoch and Abraham is relevant and well-supported by Quranic references. The student also provides insightful takeaways from their lives, emphasizing faithfulness, trust in God's wisdom, patience, and humility. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a more direct connection to the provided reference answer, specifically mentioning Abraham and Noah as the biblical figures cited as examples of blamelessness. Additionally, the student's conclusion could be strengthened by expanding on the practical application of blamelessness in the lives of Christians."
