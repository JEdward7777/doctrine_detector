However, it does not directly address the concern raised about helping Christians understand the practical application of blamelessness in their own lives. The focus is more on Islamic perspectives and teachings rather than specifically addressing the Christian worldview in relation to the concept of blamelessness. Incorporating more comparisons and reflections on how Christians can apply the lessons learned from Enoch and Abraham to strive for blamelessness in their own lives would have strengthened the response."
