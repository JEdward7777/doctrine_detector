However, the student didn't directly address the concern presented, which was to help Christians understand the practical application of blamelessness in their own lives. While the response brings valuable insights from an Islamic perspective, it lacks a clear transition or explanation on how these lessons can be applied by Christians in cultivating blamelessness in their daily walk with God. The response could have been strengthened by drawing more explicit parallels or offering specific guidance for Christians based on the examples of Enoch and Abraham."
