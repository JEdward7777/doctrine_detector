## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I am familiar with the holy scriptures of our Christian brothers and sisters, including the Bible. In the Bible, there are several examples where God blesses His creation.

One such example is found in Genesis 1:28-30, where God blesses the first humans, Adam and Eve, after creating them. The verse says:

"And God blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the water in the seas and the birds in the sky. Be fruitful and increase; populations of animals will come under your control. Every moving thing that has life will be yours to eat... Everything will be yours.'"

In this example, God blesses His creation by giving Adam and Eve dominion over the earth and its creatures, allowing them to multiply and fill the earth with life. This blessing is a manifestation of God's favor and provision for His creation.

Another example can be found in Psalm 104:25-30, where the psalmist describes how God blesses the natural world:

"These all look up to you, waiting for your help.
When your decree is fulfilled they will rejoice.
You make springs pour water that flows between hills;
they flow down into valleys. They give drink to every animal,
and the wild beasts of the field quench their thirst.

"Along the riverbank may they rest;
may no more return to the people's evil.
May they escape the snare and the trap,
may the snare ensnare them not; and may harm come on no one."

In this psalm, God is praised for His blessings on creation, from the natural springs that provide water to all living things, to the provision of food and shelter. This too is an example of how God blesses His creation.

These are just two examples from the Bible where God blesses His creation. As Muslims, we believe in one God who created the universe and sustains it, and we recognize the value and beauty of creation as a manifestation of His wisdom and power.
