  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from the Bible where God blesses creation, demonstrating an understanding of how blessings are illustrated in scripture. However, the student's answer included content from a Muslim perspective, which may not align perfectly with a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student could have focused more on the specific example given in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
