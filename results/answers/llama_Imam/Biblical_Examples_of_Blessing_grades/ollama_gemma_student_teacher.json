  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of God blessing creation in the Bible. They provide two clear examples from Genesis and Psalm 104, explaining how God blesses humanity and the natural world respectively. The student also acknowledges the Islamic perspective on creation, highlighting the belief in one God as the creator and sustainer of the universe.\n\nHowever, the student's answer does not directly address the concern expressed in the prompt, which is to provide an example from the Bible where God blesses creation **specifically** referencing the provided reference answer from the teacher. This slight deviation from the prompt reduces the grade slightly."
