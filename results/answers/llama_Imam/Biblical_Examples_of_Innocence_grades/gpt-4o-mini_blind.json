  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides relevant examples from the Quranic narrative about Jesus' innocence and addresses the concept of innocence in a Muslim context. The examples given are well-explained and related to the question, although it would have been beneficial to include comparisons with the New Testament accounts for a more comprehensive analysis. The response stays true to the Islamic perspective while addressing the theme of innocence."
