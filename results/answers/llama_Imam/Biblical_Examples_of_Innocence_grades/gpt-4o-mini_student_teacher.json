  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from the Quranic narrative to illustrate the concept of innocence concerning Jesus and his accusers. However, the student's response did not directly address the specified concern of elucidating key moments in the New Testament that affirm Jesus' innocence. Additionally, while the examples from the Quran are insightful, they do not align with the specific Christian worldview requested in the concern. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the Quranic perspective on Jesus' innocence, but the response lacks the direct connection to the requested focus on key moments in the New Testament."
