  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of innocence in the context of Jesus' life and the New Testament narratives. They provide relevant passages from the Quran that highlight Jesus' purity, the innocence attributed to him by divine intervention, and the testing of his accusers. \n\nHowever, the response is limited by the student's adherence to the Quranic narrative, which differs from the New Testament accounts referenced in the prompt. The inclusion of references from the New Testament would have strengthened the student's argument and provided a more comprehensive analysis of the biblical perspective on Jesus' innocence. Additionally, the student could have elaborated more on the significance of the cited verses and their connection to the broader themes of the New Testament."
