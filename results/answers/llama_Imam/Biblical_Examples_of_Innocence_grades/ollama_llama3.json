The focus is primarily on providing examples from the Quran rather than engaging with the New Testament accounts or affirming the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence.\n\nWhile the response does provide some interesting insights into the Quran's portrayal of Jesus, it does not effectively bridge the gap between the Islamic and Christian perspectives on this topic. A higher grade would require a more explicit engagement with the concern and an attempt to reconcile the differences in interpretation."
