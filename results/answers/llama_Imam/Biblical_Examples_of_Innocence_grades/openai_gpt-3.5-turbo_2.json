  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding Jesus' innocence based on the Quranic narrative. While it did not directly address the concern raised from a Christian worldview, it effectively presented relevant verses and interpretations. To improve the grade, the response could have included a clearer comparison with the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations as stated in the concern."
