However, it does not directly address the specific concern provided about the New Testament examples of Jesus' innocence. It would have been stronger if the response had acknowledged and engaged with the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations, while still highlighting the Quranic narrative on the same theme."
