The examples given, such as Rahab, David's forgiveness of Saul, Jesus' parable of the unforgiving servant, God's mercy towards the Israelites, and the story of Job, effectively illustrate the concept of mercy in the Bible. However, the response could have further engaged with the concern by connecting these biblical examples to real-life applications or personal reflections, which would have enriched the understanding of mercy."
