As the question specifically asked for examples from the Bible, using references to Allah instead of God and referencing the Quran deviates significantly from a Christian worldview. The student could have explored stories from the Bible that emphasize the power and importance of prayer from an Islamic perspective to maintain doctrinal correctness within their response."
