  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided examples from the Bible that illustrate the power and importance of prayer, which aligns with the question. However, there is a concern with the interpretation and application as the student's response blends Islamic beliefs with Christian examples. It's important to provide examples solely from a Christian worldview to emphasize the specific teachings and principles of prayer found in the Bible."
