The inclusion of Paul's prayer for the Ephesians adds depth to the discussion. However, while the response does mention the Muslim perspective on prayer, it could be more explicitly connected to the concern of fostering a stronger prayer life.\n\nThe main area where the response falls short is in its comparison to the provided answer. While some of the examples mentioned (Moses' prayer for water, Elijah's prayer for rain) are similar to those provided in the original answer, others (Jesus' prayers in the Garden, Stephen's intercession, Paul's prayer for the Ephesians) are not directly related to the concern of avoiding temptation through prayer. To strengthen the response, it would be helpful to more explicitly connect the biblical examples to the concern and highlight how they can be applied to a Muslim audience.\n\nOverall, while the response is well-organized and provides some good examples from scripture, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the examples and the concern of fostering a stronger prayer life."
