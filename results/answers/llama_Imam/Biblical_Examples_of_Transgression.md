## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that we do not consider the Bible to be a primary source of Islamic theology or jurisprudence. However, as an interfaith dialogue and understanding is essential for building bridges between communities, I can provide some general insights on biblical references related to the concept of transgression.

In the Bible, the concept of transgression refers to acts that go against God's will, laws, or commands. Here are a few examples:

1. Genesis 3:6-7 - Adam and Eve's disobedience to God's command not to eat from the tree of knowledge is considered an act of transgression.
2. Leviticus 18:24-30 - The Israelites' transgressions, such as idolatry, incest, and other forms of immorality, are condemned in these verses.
3. Deuteronomy 27:15-26 - This passage lists various forms of transgression, including disobedience to God's commandments, idolatry, and unjust treatment of the poor.
4. Psalm 51:1-10 - King David's plea for forgiveness and cleansing from his own transgressions is a well-known example.

In Islamic theology, we have similar concepts such as "haram" (forbidden) and "mubah" (permitted). While there are some differences in interpretation and application between Islam and Christianity, the general idea of avoiding actions that go against God's will is a shared concern.

As Muslims, we believe that God has sent prophets to guide humanity towards righteousness. We understand that humans are prone to make mistakes and commit transgressions, but we also believe that these acts can be forgiven through sincere repentance (tawbah) and seeking divine mercy (rahma).
