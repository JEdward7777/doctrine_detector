  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful understanding of the Christian worldview and its application of biblical principles to the concept of trespass. The inclusion of relevant biblical passages and their connection to moral and spiritual lessons is commendable. Additionally, the student acknowledges the similarities between Christian and Islamic values concerning respect for property, justice, and forgiveness.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by including more specific examples from the Bible that relate to the concerns raised in the question. The inclusion of the suggested examples from 1 Samuel 25:28 and Romans 5:20-21 would provide additional support for the student's arguments."
