  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided strong examples from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship, showcasing a good understanding of the importance of avoiding idolatry in worship. However, the response included references from Deuteronomy and Jeremiah, while the teacher's reference answer was from Exodus. This slight deviation affected the accuracy of the response. Additionally, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly quoting the referenced Bible verses. Overall, a commendable effort with room for improvement in accuracy and direct quotation of scriptures."
