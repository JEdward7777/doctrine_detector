My dear brother or sister, I must say that while our scriptures may differ in terms of revelation and text, we can still learn valuable lessons from each other's religious traditions.

Yes, in the Bible, there are several instances where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship. One notable example is found in Deuteronomy 6:10-15, where God commands the Israelites to destroy the idolatrous Canaanite altars and to serve only Him:

"When you cross over into the land that the Lord your God is giving you, when you possess it and settle down, be careful not to follow the practices of those nations that I am driving out before you. Do not worship their gods, nor practice doing what they do; for this will turn a curse into a blessing if you obey the Lord your God."

Here, the Bible contrasts the true worship of God with the false idolatry practiced by the Canaanites. Similarly, in Jeremiah 2:11-12, the prophet Jeremiah rebukes the Israelites for turning away from the true God and worshipping idols:

"Has a nation ever changed its gods, even when they did not hear you or see what you did? Yet you have done as foolishly as that, for whenever the people of Israel turned their faces away from Me, the more they got defiled. My people have forsaken me, the fountain of living water! They have hewn out cisterns for themselves, cracked cisterns that can hold no water."

In this passage, Jeremiah highlights the foolishness and futility of idol worship in contrast to the living, life-giving worship of God.

These examples serve as powerful reminders of the importance of genuine faith and devotion to the One True God, free from the corruption and emptiness of idolatry. May we all strive to follow the path of righteousness and purity, as commanded by our Lord.
