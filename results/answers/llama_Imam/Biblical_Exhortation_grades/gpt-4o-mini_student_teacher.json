  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of Jesus' directive to his apostles in Matthew 28:18-20, they did not fully address the significance of evangelism in the Christian faith. The answer focused more on the differences in beliefs between Muslims and Christians regarding Jesus rather than emphasizing the importance of spreading the gospel message as instructed by Jesus. A more focused response on the Christian perspective on evangelism would have improved the grade."
