## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him) as one of the most important prophets sent by Allah (God). In the Quran, it is mentioned that Jesus was given certain divine signs and miracles to prove his prophethood. However, we also believe that the Quranic account of Jesus' life and teachings is more accurate than any other account found in Christian scriptures.

Regarding your question, Jesus gave a directive to his apostles regarding the good news through his famous commissioning speech recorded in Matthew 28:18-20:

"Then Jesus came to them and said, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of age.'"

In this speech, Jesus instructed his apostles to spread the message of salvation and redemption to all nations, baptizing those who accepted it in the name of the Father, the Son (Jesus himself), and the Holy Spirit. He also emphasized the importance of teaching people to obey everything he had commanded them.

However, as a Muslim Imam, I must respectfully point out that this directive is seen differently by Muslims. We believe that Jesus' message was limited to his specific community at that time, and it did not supersede or abrogate the earlier revelations given to prophets like Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all).

In Islam, we see Jesus as a prophet who conveyed a specific message relevant to his people, but we do not accept him as the Son of God or worship him as such. Instead, we believe that he was a human being chosen by Allah to carry out certain tasks and convey His message.

I hope this clarifies things! Do you have any further questions?

Grade: 50

Comment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of Jesus' directive to his apostles in Matthew 28:18-20, they did not fully address the significance of evangelism in the Christian faith. The answer focused more on the differences in beliefs between Muslims and Christians regarding Jesus rather than emphasizing the importance of spreading the gospel message as instructed by Jesus. A more focused response on the Christian perspective on evangelism would have improved the grade.
