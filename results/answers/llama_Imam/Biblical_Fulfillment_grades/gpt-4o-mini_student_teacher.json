They correctly identified relevant passages from the Hebrew Bible and connected them to Jesus' royal lineage and messianic claims. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the specific prophecy regarding the Messiah coming from David's line to establish an everlasting kingdom, as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, while the student provided a well-written perspective from an Islamic viewpoint, the concern was focused on recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment within a Christian worldview."
