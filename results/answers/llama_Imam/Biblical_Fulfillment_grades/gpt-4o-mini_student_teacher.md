## [Answer](../Biblical_Fulfillment.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum (peace be upon you). As an Imam, I must emphasize that Jesus, peace be upon him, is a revered prophet in Islam, and we acknowledge his importance in both Jewish and Christian traditions.

The reference to Jesus as the "King of the Jews" in the Bible (Matthew 2:2; John 19:15) indeed reflects Old Testament prophecies. In the Hebrew Bible, several passages speak of a future messianic figure who will be a king and savior for Israel.

One example is Psalm 2:6-12, which prophesies that a coming king will rule with God's rod of iron and crush his enemies. Similarly, Isaiah 11:1-10 describes a future ruler who will bring peace and justice to the earth, and Micah 5:2-4 foretells the birth of a future king from Bethlehem who will shepherd Israel.

In Luke 1:32,33, an angel speaks to Mary about Jesus' role as "the son of the Most High" who will be given "the throne of his father David." This echoes Psalm 89:3,4, which promises that God will establish a new covenant with Israel through one of David's descendants.

The title "King of the Jews" in John 19:15 also reflects Jesus' royal lineage and messianic claims. As a Jewish prophet, Jesus was expected to be a descendant of King David, as prophesied in Psalm 89:3-5. The Roman authorities recognized this by affixing the inscription "King of the Jews" on Jesus' crucifixion cross (John 19:15).

In Islam, we recognize Jesus as one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah (God), and his message was a call to submit to God's will and follow His guidance. As Muslims, we believe that Jesus was sent specifically to guide the Children of Israel, but his message also encompassed universal truths and values that apply to all humanity.

May Allah's peace be upon Jesus, as well as all prophets who have been sent to guide humanity towards a path of righteousness and submission to His will.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thorough and insightful explanation of how the references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the Bible reflect Old Testament prophecies. They correctly identified relevant passages from the Hebrew Bible and connected them to Jesus' royal lineage and messianic claims. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the specific prophecy regarding the Messiah coming from David's line to establish an everlasting kingdom, as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, while the student provided a well-written perspective from an Islamic viewpoint, the concern was focused on recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment within a Christian worldview.
