However, the response predominantly focuses on the Islamic perspective of Jesus as a prophet and lacks a strong emphasis on the importance of recognizing biblical prophecy fulfillment within Christian theology. More explicit connections to the Christian worldview and a deeper exploration of the impact of these prophecies on Christian beliefs would have strengthened the response."
