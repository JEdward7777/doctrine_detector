However, as an Islamic scholar tasked with discussing Christian beliefs, the answer lacks a truly Christian-specific worldview. The emphasis on Islamic teachings and the comparison with Quranic perspectives take away from providing a deep analysis solely within the context of the Bible. The response could further deepen doctrinal correctness by focusing on the unique Christian understanding of sin and redemption without interfaith comparisons."
