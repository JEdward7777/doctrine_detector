  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provides an insightful comparison of how the Bible illustrates the consequences of guilt and sin from an Islamic perspective. However, the student's answer did not fully grasp the seriousness of sin and its implications in the context of God's grace and mercy. The response focused more on presenting various consequences of sin and methods for dealing with guilt rather than emphasizing the fundamental concept of deserving punishment for sin. The answer lacks a deep reflection on the gravity of sin and the need for God's grace for redemption."
