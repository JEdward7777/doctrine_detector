It also discusses methods for dealing with guilt and sin based on Biblical teachings. The integration of Islamic perspectives and the emphasis on understanding and respecting the beliefs of others showcase a respectful and inclusive approach. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the seriousness of sin to fully appreciate God's grace and mercy, as highlighted in the concern."
