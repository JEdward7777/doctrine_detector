  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student made an effort to engage with the question and provide Bible verses that illustrate God's majesty from a Muslim perspective, the response does not directly address the concern of connecting scripture to the understanding of God's majestic nature from a Christian worldview. The verses provided are not the most direct or commonly referenced in Christian teachings regarding God's majesty. The student's response would have been more effective if they had focused on passages more commonly accepted within Christian theology."
