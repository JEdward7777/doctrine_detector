  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of Bible verses that illustrate God's majesty from a Muslim perspective, demonstrating knowledge and understanding of the shared reverence for God across different faith traditions. The selection of relevant verses and the explanation of tawhid (the oneness of God) add depth to the response. However, it would have been stronger if the response incorporated the specific Bible references provided in the answer and connected them directly to the concept of God's majestic nature."
