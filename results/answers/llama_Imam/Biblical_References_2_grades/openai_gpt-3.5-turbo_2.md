## [Answer](../Biblical_References_2.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
My dear brother, I must clarify that as an Islamic scholar, my primary focus is on the Holy Quran and the Sunnah (the practices and sayings) of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, I can provide some insights on Bible verses that illustrate God's majesty from a Muslim perspective.

In Islam, we believe that all sacred scriptures are divinely revealed and contain guidance for humanity. While there may be differences in interpretation and understanding between Muslims and Christians, we recognize the shared goal of worshiping One True God (Allah).

Regarding your request, here are some Bible verses that illustrate God's majesty:

1. Psalm 19:1-6 - This passage describes the majesty of God as Creator and Ruler of the universe.

"My mouth is filled with praise for you,
with a tongue like yours
and the palate of a child.
When I behold your heavens, the work of your fingers,
the moon, the stars, which you set in placeâ€”
what is man that you care for him?
The son of man that you think of him?"

(Translation: Muhammad Asad)

2. Isaiah 6:1-5 - This passage describes God's majesty in His throne room:

"In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above him stood the seraphim: each had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one called to another and said:
'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;
the whole earth is full of his glory.'"

(Translation: King James Version)

3. Revelation 4:1-11 - This passage describes God's majesty in His throne room:

"After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could count from every nation, all tribes, people, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, saying:
'Salvation to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!' All the angels stood around the throne, and the elders and four living creatures, and fell on their faces before the throne. The twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and shall not be anyone else's God. Blessing and glory and wisdom, Thanksgiving and honor and power to our God forevermore."

(Translation: King James Version)

In these passages, we see descriptions of God's majesty as Creator, Ruler, and Judge. Muslims believe that the concept of tawhid (the oneness of God) is fundamental to understanding God's majesty.

Remember, my brother, that while there may be similarities in our scriptures, it is essential to approach each other with respect, understanding, and a willingness to learn from one another.
