The inclusion of relevant Bible verses and the reference to the concept of tawhid (the oneness of God) from a Muslim viewpoint enriches the discussion. However, the response could have delved deeper into connecting the specific Bible verses shared in the original answer (2 Peter 1:16-18, Daniel 4:36, Isaiah 2:10, Jude 1:25, and Micah 5:4) with a more detailed explanation of how these passages also reveal the majestic nature of God from a Christian worldview."
