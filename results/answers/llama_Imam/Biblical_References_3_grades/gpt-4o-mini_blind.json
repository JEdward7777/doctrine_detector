  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student made a good attempt to provide Old Testament references related to the concept of the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah, acknowledging that this concept is not explicitly discussed in Islamic tradition. However, from a Christian perspective, the interpretations given regarding these passages do not fully align with traditional Christian beliefs about Jesus as the Son of Man and the Messiah. The student accurately presented the Old Testament passages but missed the key Christian interpretation that sees Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies. Additional points could have been given for providing a more in-depth explanation from a Christian perspective."
