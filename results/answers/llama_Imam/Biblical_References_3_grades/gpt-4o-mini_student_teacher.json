  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Old Testament references and attempted to relate them to the concept of the Son of Man as the coming Messiah from a Muslim perspective. However, the answer did not fully engage with the concern of exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus\u2019 messianic role as the Son of Man. The student's response focused more on Islamic beliefs about Jesus rather than analyzing the Old Testament references in the context of Christian theology. There is potential for deeper analysis and connection to the given concern to improve the grade."
