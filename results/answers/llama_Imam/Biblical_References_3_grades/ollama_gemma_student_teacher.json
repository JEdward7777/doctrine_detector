  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful consideration of the Christian perspective on the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah. While the student acknowledges that the concept is not explicitly mentioned in Islamic tradition, they provide insightful interpretations of several Old Testament references from a Muslim perspective. The inclusion of passages from Daniel, Ezekiel, Psalm 8, and Zechariah supports the student's argument that these references contribute to the understanding of Jesus' messianic role. The response is well-organized and clearly articulates the student's position without compromising theological integrity."
