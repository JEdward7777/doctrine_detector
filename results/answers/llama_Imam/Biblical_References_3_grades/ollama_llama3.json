  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response provides a good overview of Old Testament references that relate to the concept of the \"Son of Man\" and how they might be understood from a Muslim perspective. It also attempts to connect these references to Jesus' role as a prophet and messenger, which is relevant to the concern.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\" The references provided are mainly from the Old Testament, but there is no explicit discussion of how these texts relate to the New Testament's depiction of Jesus as the Son of Man. Additionally, while the response acknowledges that the concept of the Son of Man was later developed in Christian scripture and tradition, it does not explore this development or its significance for understanding Jesus' messianic role.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the Old Testament references and the New Testament's portrayal of Jesus as the Son of Man."
