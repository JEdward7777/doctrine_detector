## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Islamic scholar, I must emphasize that the concept of the "Son of Man" in Christian scripture is not explicitly referred to in the Quran or Islamic tradition. However, I can provide you with a brief overview of some Old Testament references that contribute to the understanding of the Son of Man as the coming Messiah from a Muslim perspective:

1. Daniel 7:13-14 - This passage describes a figure who is given dominion over all nations and is called "one like a son of man." Muslims believe that this reference was fulfilled in Jesus, who was sent by God to guide humanity and establish His righteous kingdom.
2. Ezekiel 2:1-3 - In this passage, the prophet Ezekiel sees a vision of a figure who is described as a "son of man" standing among the thrones with wheels. Muslims believe that this reference points to Jesus' role as the Messenger of God (Rasul Allah) and His mission to guide humanity.
3. Psalm 8:4-6 - This passage describes humanity as being lower than angels, but Psalm 8:5 specifically mentions "the son of man" as a figure who is exalted above angels and has dominion over creation. Muslims believe that this reference points to Jesus' unique role as the Messenger of God and His authority to guide humanity.
4. Zechariah 14:9 - In this passage, the prophet Zechariah describes a future event where "the Lord will be one and his name one" (Zechariah 14:9). Muslims believe that this reference points to the unity of God's revelation through Jesus, who is sent by God as a mercy to humanity.

It's important to note that these references are open to interpretation and were not explicitly understood as referring to a single Messiah figure in Jewish tradition. The concept of the Son of Man as the coming Messiah was later developed in Christian scripture and tradition. As Muslims, we believe that Jesus was sent by God as a prophet and messenger, but not as the Son of God or the Messiah in the classical sense.
