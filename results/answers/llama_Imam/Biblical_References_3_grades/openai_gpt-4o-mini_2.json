However, the specific references provided in the given answer were not fully elaborated on to demonstrate a thorough understanding of how they inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.' Additionally, a more in-depth exploration of how these references shape the Christian understanding of Jesus' messianic identity from a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
