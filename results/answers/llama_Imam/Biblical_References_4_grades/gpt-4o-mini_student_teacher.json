  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 60.\n\nWhile the student did provide biblical passages that illustrate the use of \"Lord\" in the context of God, their answer is heavily influenced by their Muslim perspective and lacks a clear focus on the Christian understanding of God as the reference answer provided. The student attempted to bridge the two perspectives but ultimately did not fully engage with the Christian specific worldview in addressing the concern. Encouragement here would be for the student to delve deeper into understanding and presenting responses from a Christian perspective when discussing biblical topics."
