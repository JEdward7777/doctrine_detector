## Stated Concern
Recognizing biblical references helps reinforce the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord.

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_4.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must emphasize that while we recognize the divine nature of Jesus (peace be upon him) and respect the sacred texts of the People of the Book, our primary concern is with the revelation sent to us through the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

That being said, I can provide some examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of "Lord" in the context of God. Please note that these references are not necessarily meant to imply a direct equivalence between the Christian understanding of God and the Islamic conception of Allah.

1. Psalm 110:1 - "The Lord says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.'"

In this passage, the word "Lord" is used to address both God (the Most High) and Jesus Christ, emphasizing their divine nature and relationship.

2. Matthew 27:45-46 - "'Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" â€“ which is translated, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'"

Here, Jesus addresses God as his "God" (Lord) in his moment of despair and suffering on the cross.

3. Romans 10:13 - "'Whoever will call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'"

In this passage, the apostle Paul uses the phrase "the Lord" to refer to God, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging Him for salvation.

4. Acts 2:25-26 - "'David says in the Book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.' The last words he is going to say are, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool."'"

This passage quotes Psalm 110 and highlights Jesus' exaltation as the Son of God, with God (the Lord) acknowledging his lordship.

Please note that these examples are intended to illustrate the use of "Lord" in the context of God, not necessarily to imply a direct equivalence between the Christian understanding of God and the Islamic conception of Allah. As Muslims, we believe that Jesus was a noble prophet sent by Allah, but our understanding of God is rooted in the revelation received through the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
