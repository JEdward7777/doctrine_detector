  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides relevant biblical passages that illustrate the use of \"Lord\" in the context of God, emphasizing His authority and divinity. The examples chosen effectively reinforce the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord. However, there could have been a stronger articulation of how these references specifically support the Christian understanding of God's authority and uniqueness, considering the concern provided. A more explicit connection between the biblical passages and the Christian worldview would have further enhanced the response."
