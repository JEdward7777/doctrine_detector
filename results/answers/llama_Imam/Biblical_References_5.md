## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must consult with my Islamic knowledge and traditions. However, since you're asking about Christian scriptures, I'll do my best to provide an answer.

The New Testament scripture that connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings is 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, which states:

"Clean out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed. Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."

In this passage, the Apostle Paul draws a connection between the Jewish tradition of eating unleavened bread during Passover (which commemorates Israel's exodus from Egypt) and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the "Passover lamb." This symbolism highlights the idea that through faith in Jesus Christ, believers are redeemed and become "new creations" (2 Corinthians 5:17), just like the unleavened bread represents a fresh start.

In Islamic perspective, we believe that Jesus was a prophet sent by Allah, but we do not accept him as the Son of God or the savior. Nevertheless, I hope this answer helps you understand the Christian connection to unleavened bread. If you have any more questions or would like to discuss further, please feel free to ask!
