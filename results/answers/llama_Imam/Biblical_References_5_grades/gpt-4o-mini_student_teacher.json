  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided the correct scripture reference and explained its connection to Christian teachings, showing an understanding of the significance of unleavened bread in Christianity. However, the student's response also includes irrelevant information about Islamic beliefs and perspectives on Jesus, which detracts from the focus on Christian teachings. In a Christian specific worldview, it is important to stay focused on biblical texts and interpretations relevant to the faith being discussed."
