The explanation was clear and demonstrated an understanding of the symbolism and significance behind the use of unleavened bread in the Christian context. The only slight deduction is for not directly quoting the given 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 verse, but overall, the response shows a solid grasp of the Christian perspective on unleavened bread."
