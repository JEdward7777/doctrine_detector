The student effectively presents the biblical perspectives while also affirming the importance of the Quran in Islamic teachings. However, there could be more depth in analyzing the significance and nuances of each biblical reference and how they contribute to the overall understanding of resurrection in Christianity. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of these verses from a Christian worldview would enhance the response."
