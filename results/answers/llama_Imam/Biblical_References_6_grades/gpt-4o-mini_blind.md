## [Answer](../Biblical_References_6.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must emphasize that the Quran provides the most comprehensive and clear revelation on the concept of resurrection. However, as you requested, I can provide some biblical references that may offer insights into this topic.

In the Bible, the concept of resurrection is mentioned in various passages, including:

1. Job 14:14-15 - This passage speaks about the hope of a future resurrection for those who are righteous.
2. Psalm 16:10 - David writes about his trust in God's promise to resurrect him.
3. Daniel 12:2-3 - The prophet Daniel describes a future time when many will be raised from the dead, and some will have eternal life.
4. Hosea 13:14 - This passage speaks of God reviving the dead and calling them back to life.
5. Matthew 22:31-32 - Jesus quotes Exodus 3:6, saying that God is the God of the living, implying that there will be a future resurrection.
6. John 5:28-29 - Jesus says that the hour will come when all who are in their graves will hear His voice and come out to meet Him.
7. Acts 2:31-32 (quoting Psalm 16:8-11) - Peter preaches about Jesus' resurrection as a sign of what is to come for believers.
8. 1 Corinthians 15:20-23, 51-57 - Paul writes extensively on the concept of resurrection, emphasizing that it will be a bodily transformation and a union with those who have already died in faith.

Please note that these passages may not fully align with Islamic beliefs regarding the nature of resurrection or the afterlife. However, they do offer insights into the biblical understanding of this concept.

In Islam, we believe that the Quran provides the most detailed and clear revelation on the concept of resurrection. The Quran describes the grave as a place where souls will rest until the Day of Judgment, when all people will be raised from the dead to face God's judgment.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive list of Bible verses related to the concept of resurrection and acknowledges the differences in beliefs between Christianity and Islam regarding this topic. The student effectively presents the biblical perspectives while also affirming the importance of the Quran in Islamic teachings. However, there could be more depth in analyzing the significance and nuances of each biblical reference and how they contribute to the overall understanding of resurrection in Christianity. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of these verses from a Christian worldview would enhance the response.
