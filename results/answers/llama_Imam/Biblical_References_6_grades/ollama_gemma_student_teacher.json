  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical concepts of resurrection and eternal life. They provide relevant passages from the Old and New Testaments that support their claims. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview, specifically referencing the role of Jesus Christ in the resurrection. Additionally, the student's inclusion of their Islamic perspective on the afterlife adds an interesting dimension to the response but may not be relevant to the Christian-specific worldview specified in the concern."
