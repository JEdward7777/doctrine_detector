  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThis response partially addresses the concern to focus on scripture, as it provides a list of biblical passages related to resurrection and eternal life. However, the response also veers off into discussing Islamic beliefs about resurrection, which is not directly relevant to the concern or the original answer.\n\nWhile the inclusion of Quranic references may be interesting from an interfaith perspective, it detracts from the main task of providing scriptural support for Christian teachings on resurrection. The response could have benefited from a more focused and detailed exploration of biblical texts related to this topic, rather than branching out into other religious traditions.\n\nTo improve, the response could have stuck more closely to the original answer's focus on relevant Bible verses and provided more in-depth analysis or reflection on those passages."
