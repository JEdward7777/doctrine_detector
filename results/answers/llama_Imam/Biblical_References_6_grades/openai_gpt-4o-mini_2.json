  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough list of relevant Bible verses that discuss resurrection and eternal life, aligning well with the concern of focusing on scripture for grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts. The inclusion of specific verses adds depth and clarity to the discussion of resurrection. However, deducting some points for not directly addressing the concern by addressing only the content of the answer, without discussing the importance of grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts."
