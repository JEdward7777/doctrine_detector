  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of the Sabbath in the Christian and Jewish traditions by providing relevant biblical references. However, the response's focus on Islamic perspective and practices detracts from the specified concern of identifying scriptural backing for the Sabbath observance in Christian faith. This response would have been more effective in addressing the given question by solely focusing on the Christian perspective."
