  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical significance of the Sabbath. They provide relevant references from both the Old and New Testaments to support their claims. However, the answer is not graded as high as it could be due to the inclusion of irrelevant information about Muslim beliefs and practices. The student could have focused more explicitly on the Christian perspective on the Sabbath."
