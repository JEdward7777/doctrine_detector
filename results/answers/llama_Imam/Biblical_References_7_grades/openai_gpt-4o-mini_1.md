## [Answer](../Biblical_References_7.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that as Muslims, we don't consider the Bible to be a sacred text or follow its practices. However, I can acknowledge the historical significance of the Sabbath in the Jewish and Christian traditions.

From a biblical perspective, some key references highlighting the importance of the Sabbath are:

1. Genesis 2:2-3 - This passage mentions God resting on the seventh day after creating the world, making it a sacred day.
2. Exodus 20:8-11 (KJV) - The Ten Commandments include "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."
3. Isaiah 56:1-6 - This chapter emphasizes that the Sabbath is for all people, not just Israelites, and that those who keep it will find joy and honor.
4. Matthew 11:28-30 (KJV) - Jesus refers to himself as "Lord of the Sabbath," emphasizing his connection to God's rest day.

In Islam, we don't observe the Sabbath or any other specific days as sacred. Instead, we focus on following Allah's commands and adhering to the five daily prayers, Friday congregational prayer, and observing Ramadan for spiritual growth and purification.
