It correctly identifies the significance of these passages in highlighting sin as slavery, the value of human life, Jesus as the ultimate ransom, and the concept of substitution. The inclusion of both Old and New Testament verses demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, there could have been more depth in analyzing how the concept of ransom in the Old Testament foreshadows the ultimate ransom paid by Jesus in the New Testament. Additionally, a stronger connection could have been made to how this concept of ransom ties into the broader theme of atonement in Christian theology. Overall, a well-rounded response with room for deeper theological reflection."
