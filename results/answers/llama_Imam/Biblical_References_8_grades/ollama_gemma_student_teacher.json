It demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical passages and their relevance to the theme of redemption. Additionally, the student thoughtfully explores the parallels between the Old and New Testaments and highlights the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate ransom. However, including the teacher's suggested key verses would have strengthened the response."
