  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student correctly identified relevant Bible verses related to covenant faithfulness, demonstrating awareness of key themes in Christian scripture. However, the response lacked depth in analyzing the significance of these passages within Christian theology. Additionally, the emphasis on Islamic perspective at the beginning of the response was unnecessary for the question asked. Encouraging more in-depth analysis and insight into the theological implications of covenant faithfulness in the context of Christianity would strengthen the response."
