However, the response lacked depth and engagement with the specific references provided in the teacher's answer (Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18). Additionally, while the student attempted to address the concern within the context of their Islamic background, more analysis and comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on covenant faithfulness could have enhanced the response."
