  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of covenant faithfulness and provides relevant biblical references to support their points. However, the answer lacks specific references to the concern of connecting scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness. Additionally, the student clearly states that their focus is on Islamic scholarship, which is appropriate for the question."
