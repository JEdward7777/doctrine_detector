# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Islamic scholar, I must clarify that our focus is on the Quran and Hadith, not other scriptures. However, since you've asked about biblical references, I'll provide some relevant passages.

In the Christian Bible, the concept of covenant faithfulness is rooted in God's promises to His chosen people, particularly with Abraham (Gen 12:1-3), Moses (Exodus 19:5-6), and David (Psalm 89:1-4). Here are a few verses related to covenant faithfulness:

1. Genesis 9:8-17 - After the flood, God establishes a covenant with Noah, promising never again to destroy the earth with a flood.
2. Exodus 34:10-28 - At Mount Sinai, God renews His covenant with Israel, emphasizing His mercy and justice.
3. Psalm 105:1-11 - This psalm describes God's faithfulness to Israel throughout their history, despite their disobedience.
4. Jeremiah 7:21-26; 11:1-8 - The prophet Jeremiah emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's laws as a demonstration of covenant faithfulness.

Please note that these references are from the Christian Bible and may have different interpretations within Christianity. As an Islamic scholar, I cannot provide in-depth analysis or commentary on these verses.
