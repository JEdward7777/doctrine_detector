  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does touch on the correct themes of apostolic mission to Gentiles and faith in Jesus, it primarily focuses on summarizing biblical passages rather than exploring the scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion as requested. The response also strays from the concern by introducing Islamic perspectives and language (\"Praise be to Allah\", \"As Muslims\"), which is not relevant to the Christian context of the passages being discussed.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more detailed analysis and application of the scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion. For example, the writer could have explored how these passages demonstrate God's universal love and mercy towards all humanity, rather than just summarizing the events. Additionally, staying within a Christian perspective without introducing external theological frameworks would strengthen the response."
