Praise be to Allah, the Most Merciful.

In Acts 9:13-16, we find a crucial passage that highlights the importance of including Gentiles (non-Jews) into the fold of believers. In this passage, Peter is recounting his experience with Cornelius, a Roman centurion who was a devout believer in God. When Peter was sent to minister to Cornelius and his household, he was initially hesitant, thinking that "a person cannot become clean by taking an oath or by washing" (Acts 10:28). However, the Holy Spirit instructed him to go with the Gentiles, saying, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean" (Acts 10:15).

This passage reveals that Peter understood the message of Jesus Christ as inclusive, meaning that salvation is available to all people, regardless of their ethnicity or background. The inclusion of Gentiles in the faith was a significant turning point in Christian history, marking the beginning of the spread of Christianity beyond Jewish circles.

In Galatians 2:16, Paul emphasizes this same point by quoting from Leviticus 11:50: "Abrahamâ€™s descendants will be blessed if they continue to do what is right, but those who follow their sinful desires have been stored up for judgment" (Galatians 2:16). Here, Paul highlights the distinction between those who are justified through faith (Jews and Gentiles alike) and those who seek to earn righteousness through works.

This passage underscores the notion that salvation is not limited to a particular ethnic group or nationality. Rather, it is available to all people who put their trust in Jesus Christ and acknowledge Him as Lord. In this sense, the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith was a deliberate and intentional act of God, demonstrating His love and mercy towards all humanity.

In conclusion, these passages demonstrate that the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith was an integral part of the plan of salvation from the beginning. They highlight the universal nature of Christ's message and the fact that salvation is available to all people, regardless of their background or ethnicity. As Muslims, we respect this aspect of Christianity as a fundamental component of its theology, and we recognize it as a significant aspect of God's mercy towards humanity.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion, specifically focusing on the apostolic mission to Gentiles and the emphasis on faith in Jesus for justification rather than adherence to the law. The integration of relevant passages from Acts and Galatians with insightful interpretations aligns well with a Christian perspective on inclusivity and salvation through faith. The acknowledgment of the universal nature of Christ's message and the deliberate inclusion of Gentiles as part of God's plan of salvation further reinforces the theological depth of the reflection. The response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the Christian perspective on the concept of grace in salvation.
