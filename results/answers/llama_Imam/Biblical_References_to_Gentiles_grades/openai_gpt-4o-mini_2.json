  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response does a good job of exploring the scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion, referencing key passages from Acts and Galatians. The student effectively connects the importance of faith in Jesus over adherence to the law in justifying Gentiles before God. However, the inclusion of references to Allah and Islamic beliefs may be confusing from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could have focused more on the Christian understanding of salvation and grace without incorporating elements from a different religious tradition."
