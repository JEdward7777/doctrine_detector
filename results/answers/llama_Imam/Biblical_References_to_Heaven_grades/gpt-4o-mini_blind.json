The connections drawn between the verses and the theological principles regarding heaven are well-articulated. However, the response would benefit from a clearer delineation between Islamic teachings on heaven (Jannah) and Christian beliefs, as well as a more focused analysis from a Christian perspective without diluting it with Islamic references."
