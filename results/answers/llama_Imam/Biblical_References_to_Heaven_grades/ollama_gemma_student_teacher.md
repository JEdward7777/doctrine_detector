## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Heaven.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that our understanding of heaven comes primarily from the Quran and the Hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). However, as Muslims believe in the common Abrahamic heritage with Jews and Christians, we can also learn from the Bible. Here are some relevant verses that provide insight into the concept of heaven:

1. Genesis 5:24 - Enoch's ascension to heaven is mentioned in this verse, which sets a precedent for human beings being taken up to heaven.

2. Psalm 37:29-30 - This passage speaks about God's presence in heaven and His promise to grant eternal life to those who are righteous.

3. Isaiah 65:17-25 - This chapter describes the new heavens and earth that will be established, where there will be no more mourning, crying, or pain.

4. Revelation 21:1-27 - This passage is often referred to as a description of heaven in Christian eschatology. It speaks about a new heaven and a new earth, with God dwelling among humans once again.

5. Luke 16:19-31 - The parable of Lazarus and the rich man provides an insight into the concept of heaven and hell, highlighting the importance of treating others with kindness and compassion.

6. John 14:1-3 - Jesus' words about His Father's house having many rooms and preparing a place for those who believe in Him provide insight into the concept of heaven as a place where believers will reside.

7. Acts 7:56 - Stephen's vision of Jesus standing at God's right hand, with the promise that he would be taken up to heaven, demonstrates the connection between earth and heaven.

8. Philippians 3:20-21 - This passage describes believers' citizenship in heaven, emphasizing their true identity as heavenly citizens rather than earthly dwellers.

9. Colossians 1:5 - Paul writes about the hope of glory that awaits believers, which implies an eternal existence in heaven.

10. Hebrews 12:22-24 - The writer of Hebrews describes a place called Zion, where there is no sorrow, crying, or pain, and where God dwells among His people.

While these verses provide some insight into the concept of heaven from a Christian perspective, it's essential to remember that our understanding of heaven is primarily rooted in Islamic teachings. As Muslims, we believe that heaven (Jannah) is a realm of eternal bliss, where believers will be rewarded for their good deeds and enjoy the presence of Allah (God).
