Assalamu alaikum brother,

I'm happy to help you with your question. As an Imam, I must clarify that Muslims do not consider the Bible to be a sacred text, as it is a revelation specifically for the People of the Book (Jews and Christians). However, as part of our understanding of the Abrahamic faiths, we recognize the importance of certain biblical texts in relation to Islamic beliefs.

Regarding your question, the Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot or Pentecost, is a significant Jewish holiday. In the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), you can find references to this festival in:

1. Leviticus 23:15-21: This passage describes the instructions for observing the Festival of Weeks, which falls on the 50th day after the Sabbath.
2. Deuteronomy 16:9-12: This chapter mentions the Festival of Weeks as one of the three major Jewish holidays, along with Passover and Tabernacles.

In Christian Bibles (New Testament), Pentecost is mentioned in:

1. Acts 2:1-47: The book of Acts describes the events surrounding the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles and other believers on the day of Pentecost.
2. 1 Corinthians 15:22-23: Paul writes about the significance of Christ's resurrection and its connection to the Festival of Weeks.

Please note that these references are not necessarily related to Islamic beliefs or practices, as they pertain specifically to Jewish and Christian traditions. However, I hope this information is helpful in understanding the context and significance of the Festival of Weeks within the broader Abrahamic faiths.
