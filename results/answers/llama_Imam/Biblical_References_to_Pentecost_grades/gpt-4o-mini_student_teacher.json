  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the Festival of Weeks as it is mentioned in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. They correctly identified relevant passages from Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Acts, and 1 Corinthians. However, the student's answer focused more on explaining the significance of Pentecost within Jewish and Christian traditions rather than solely addressing the scriptural basis for its observance. Nonetheless, the response displayed a good understanding of the topic from an Islamic viewpoint and provided valuable information on the Festival of Weeks in relation to the Abrahamic faiths."
