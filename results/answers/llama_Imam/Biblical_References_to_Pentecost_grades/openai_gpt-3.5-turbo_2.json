However, the response missed key references in 2 Chronicles and Numbers, as mentioned in the provided answer. Additionally, there was a strong focus on the Jewish and Christian perspectives without delving into the Christian scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost, as specifically requested in the concern. A more thorough analysis from a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
