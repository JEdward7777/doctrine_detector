  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student respectfully acknowledged their expertise in Islamic teachings, they did not address the specific concern of understanding scriptural foundations for the belief in Jesus as Savior from a Christian perspective. The student provided information about Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus but failed to engage with the Christian scriptures of 1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20 to reveal the nature of Christ as Savior according to Christian faith. The response did not directly address the question asked."
