  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided relevant verses from the Old Testament that allude to the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone, demonstrating an understanding of the significance of this symbolism within Christian theology. However, the student missed referring to the specific verses cited in the reference answer, which could have further enriched their response. Additionally, the student appropriately acknowledged the distinction between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus. Encouraging deeper exploration of scripture would have involved a more direct engagement with the New Testament verses cited in the reference answer."
