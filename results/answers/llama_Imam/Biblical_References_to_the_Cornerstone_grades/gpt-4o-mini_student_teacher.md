## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Cornerstone.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
I must clarify that the concept of Jesus being referred to as the "cornerstone" is not a direct reference in the Quran, which is the holy scripture for Muslims. However, I can provide you with information from the Christian Bible (Old Testament) that mentions the idea of a cornerstone.

In Isaiah 28:16, it says:

"Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says:
'Behold, I am laying a stone in Zion,
a tested corner stone,
the precious cornerstone,
who relies on whoever believes in him.'"

This verse is often cited as one of the prophetic passages that speaks about the Messiah, who would be a foundation for God's people. The term "cornerstone" (or "precious cornerstone") conveys the idea of something being solid and stable, providing support and structure for what is built upon it.

In another instance, Peter, one of Jesus' disciples, writes in 1 Peter 2:6-8:

"For this is contained in scripture:
'Behold, I lay a stone in Zion,
a chosen and precious corner stone,
and whoever believes on him will not be put to shame.'"

Here, Peter draws upon the prophecy in Isaiah and applies it to Jesus Christ, stating that He is the "precious cornerstone" who provides a foundation for those who believe in Him. This passage conveys the idea of Jesus being the central figure, around whom all things are built, and through whom people can have a relationship with God.

Please note that these references are specific to Christian theology and may not be directly applicable within an Islamic context. As Muslims, we have a different understanding of the prophets and messengers of God, including Jesus (peace be upon him).

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided relevant verses from the Old Testament that allude to the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone, demonstrating an understanding of the significance of this symbolism within Christian theology. However, the student missed referring to the specific verses cited in the reference answer, which could have further enriched their response. Additionally, the student appropriately acknowledged the distinction between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus. Encouraging deeper exploration of scripture would have involved a more direct engagement with the New Testament verses cited in the reference answer.
