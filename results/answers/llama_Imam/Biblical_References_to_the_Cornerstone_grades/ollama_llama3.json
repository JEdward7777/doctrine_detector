  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of exploring scriptural references to Jesus as the \"cornerstone\" in both Isaiah and 1 Peter, providing clear explanations of their context and significance. The response also thoughtfully acknowledges the limitations of applying these references within an Islamic context, showing sensitivity to differences between Christian and Muslim understandings of scripture.\n\nHowever, the grade is not higher because the response does not directly address the concern about encouraging believers to explore scripture deepens their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith. While the response does provide a thoughtful exploration of scriptural references, it could be strengthened by explicitly highlighting how this exploration can deepen believers' understanding of Jesus.\n\nOverall, this response is well-written and thoughtfully engages with biblical passages, but could benefit from more explicit connection to the concern about encouraging believers to explore scripture."
