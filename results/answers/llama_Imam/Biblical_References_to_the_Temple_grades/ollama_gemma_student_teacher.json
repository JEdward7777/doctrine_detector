  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the scriptures and their references to the temple as the \"House of Yahweh.\" The student provides relevant and accurate citations from both the Old and New Testaments to support their claims. Additionally, the student clearly explains the unique concept of the \"House of Yahweh\" within Judaism and contrasts it with the Islamic perspective on worship. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the provided reference answer from the teacher, which includes additional scripture references."
