## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must clarify that we Muslims do not consider the Temple or any other physical structure to be the "House of Allah" (Baytullah). Instead, we believe that the House of Allah is the Kaaba in Makkah, which is considered a sacred site and a focal point for prayer.

However, if you're asking about the Jewish scriptures' references to the Temple as the "House of Yahweh," I can provide some insight. The term "House of Yahweh" (Hebrew: בֵּית יְהוָה, Beit YHWH) appears in several passages throughout the Hebrew Bible:

1. 2 Samuel 7:5 - This verse says that Yahweh's dwelling place would be with David and his descendants forever.
2. 1 Kings 8:27 - King Solomon prays to Yahweh, saying that Yahweh's "House" is in heaven, but He can hear the prayers of those who pray facing towards it (the Temple).
3. Psalm 122:2-3 - This psalm describes Jerusalem and the Temple as a place where people from all nations will come to worship Yahweh.
4. Isaiah 56:7 - The prophet Isaiah says that Yahweh's "House" is for all nations, and that foreigners can join in worshiping Yahweh there.

In the New Testament, we also see references to the Temple as the "House of God" (e.g., Matthew 21:12-13, Mark 11:15-16). However, it's important to note that early Christians did not consider the Temple to be a sacred site for their own worship, as they believed Jesus was the fulfillment of Yahweh's presence and the true Temple.

Please keep in mind that these references are from a Jewish context, and the concept of the "House of Yahweh" is unique to Judaism. In Islam, we believe that Allah is the one God who is worshipped in any place where He is remembered and honored, regardless of physical structures or buildings.
