Assalamu alaikum, brother.

The term "begat" (in Arabic, "wala" or "walad") is a common verb used in the Old Testament to describe the act of having children. In the biblical context, it refers to the father-son relationship and the transmission of lineage from one generation to another. When the Bible says that someone "begat" someone else, it means that they had a child or offspring.

For example, Genesis 5:3 states, "When Adam had lived 130 years, he begot a son in his own likeness, after his image; and named him Seth." In this context, "begot" indicates the act of fathering Seth, Adam's child.

In the Quran, however, we don't find a direct equivalent to the term "begat." Instead, Allah (SWT) describes the genealogy of the prophets using various expressions, such as "and his mother was [so-and-so]" or "his son was [so-and-so]." For instance, in Surah Al-Imran, verse 33, it is written: "And He made His wife Hannah a barren woman; and then gave her a man-child Isaac."

In summary, the term "begat" in the Bible refers to the act of having children or offspring, emphasizing the father-son relationship. While the Quran does not use this exact term, it describes genealogy using different expressions, highlighting the importance of prophetic lineage and the role of women in these accounts.
