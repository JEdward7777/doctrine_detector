However, it could have further elaborated on how genealogies are crucial in establishing Jesus' lineage as the prophesied Messiah and connecting the Old Testament prophecies to the New Testament fulfillment through Jesus. Additionally, a deeper analysis from a Christian perspective on the significance of Jesus' genealogy in fulfilling specific prophecies would have enhanced the response."
