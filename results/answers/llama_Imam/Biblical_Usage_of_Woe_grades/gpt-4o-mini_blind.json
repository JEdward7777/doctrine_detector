It appropriately cites relevant verses from the Quran and the Bible. However, the response lacks doctrinal correctness as it presents a mixed perspective of Islamic and Christian beliefs without clearly distinguishing between the two faiths. Additionally, the theological implications of the term \"woe\" and God's judgment are somewhat muddled in the explanation. This could be improved by focusing more on the specific biblical passages related to \"woe\" and emphasizing the Christian perspective without blending it with Islamic theology."
