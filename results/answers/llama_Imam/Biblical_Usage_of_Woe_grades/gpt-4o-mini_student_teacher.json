  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student did provide examples of the term \"woe\" being used in the Bible and attempted to draw connections to divine judgment, the majority of their response focused on Islamic perspectives and quotations from the Quran. The student's answer lacked depth in exploring the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student missed the opportunity to delve into the ramifications and implications of God's judgment in the context of the examples provided. More emphasis on analyzing and interpreting the biblical examples in relation to divine judgment would have strengthened the response."
