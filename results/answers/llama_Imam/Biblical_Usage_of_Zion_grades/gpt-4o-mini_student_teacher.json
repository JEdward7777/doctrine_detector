However, there were inconsistencies in the Christian-specific worldview presented, as the student's perspective as an Imam from a Muslim background could have influenced the interpretation of certain concepts. Encouraging mutual understanding and respect between different faith traditions is commendable, but the response could have benefitted from a clearer alignment with a Christian theological framework."
