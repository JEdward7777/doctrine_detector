  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provides a detailed and informative overview of the materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times. However, the perspective presented is from a Muslim Imam, which does not align with the Christian worldview being used for grading. While the information on the materials is accurate, the answer lacks a Christian perspective or understanding of the significance of altars in biblical contexts. Additionally, it would have been helpful to include references to specific biblical passages or examples related to altar construction."
