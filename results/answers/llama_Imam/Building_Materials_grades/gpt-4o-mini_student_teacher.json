  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would assign a grade of 60 to the student's response.\n\nWhile the student did provide a comprehensive and informative overview of the common materials used to construct altars during biblical times, their response did not specifically address the concern provided regarding how knowledge of these materials and structures can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and worship reverence. Additionally, the student's perspective as a Muslim Imam, while interesting, did not directly contribute to answering the question in a manner that aligns with a Christian worldview. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the historical and cultural aspects of altar construction, but the lack of a direct connection to the specified concern and the definitive Christian perspective impacted the grade."
