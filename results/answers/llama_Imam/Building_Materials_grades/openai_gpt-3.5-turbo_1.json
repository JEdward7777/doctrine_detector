However, the response lacks a direct connection to how understanding altar materials can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and reverence in worship from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, while the information presented is informative and relevant, it does not fully address the concern raised regarding the Christian significance of altar materials."
