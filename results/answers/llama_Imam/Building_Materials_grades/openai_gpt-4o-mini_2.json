  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides additional information on materials used in constructing altars during biblical times, expanding on the original answer. However, the response lacks a direct connection to how understanding these materials and structures deepens a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and reverence in worship. Additionally, the response does not address the Christian-specific concern provided, resulting in a lower grade."
