  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic concept of Taqwa and its importance in personal sanctification. However, it does not address the Christian specific worldview or the command given to believers in Jesus Christ. The reference answer provided clearly outlines the Christian perspective on sanctification, which differs from Islam. To improve the grade, the student should have acknowledged the Christian perspective and elaborated on the specific commands given to believers in Jesus regarding their personal sanctification."
