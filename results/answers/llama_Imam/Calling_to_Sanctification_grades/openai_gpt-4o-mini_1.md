## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Dear brother or sister, I'm happy to help you with that.

In Islam, our personal sanctification is guided by the command of Taqwa (تَقْوَى), which means to have fear and reverence for Allah Almighty. The Quran reminds us: "O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared" (Quran 2:268).

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has explained this concept further, saying: "I was sent to perfect the character of humanity." In other words, our faith is not just about believing in certain principles, but also about transforming our inner selves into virtuous and pious individuals.

To achieve this Taqwa, Allah commands us to:

1. Purify our intentions (niyyah): We must have pure motives for all we do, whether it's worshiping Allah or interacting with others.
2. Control our desires: We should not let our passions and desires control us, but instead strive to regulate them in accordance with Islamic teachings.
3. Guard our tongues: We are responsible for what we say and how we speak, as words can be a means of spreading good or evil.
4. Purify our wealth: We must use our resources wisely and not squander them on unnecessary things.
5. Be mindful of our actions: We should strive to do good deeds and avoid bad ones, as our actions reflect our faith.

In summary, the command regarding personal sanctification in Islam is to cultivate Taqwa by purifying our intentions, controlling our desires, guarding our tongues, purifying our wealth, and being mindful of our actions.
