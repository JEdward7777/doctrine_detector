  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 90.\n\nThis response thoroughly addresses the concern of understanding the mission of the Church to reach all nations and the inclusivity of the Gospel, as evidenced by its in-depth analysis of the centurion's visit from Peter. The writer provides biblical support for their points, demonstrating a strong grasp of Christian theology. Additionally, they expertly weave together themes of faith, sincerity, and God's desire to include all nations in His plan of salvation.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly connected the centurion's visit from Peter to the universal mission of the Church to reach all nations. While this connection is implicit throughout the response, it would be strengthened by more direct language and emphasis. Nevertheless, the writer's thoughtful engagement with Scripture and their passion for sharing God's love and mercy with all people are evident throughout.\n\nWell done!"
