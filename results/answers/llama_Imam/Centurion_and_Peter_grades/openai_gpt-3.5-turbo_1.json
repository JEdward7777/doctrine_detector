The response appropriately emphasizes the inclusivity of the Gospel message. However, the reference to Islam as also being a universal message may not fully align with a Christian worldview, as Christians believe in the exclusive salvation through Jesus Christ. The response could have further emphasized the unique role of Jesus in bringing salvation to all nations."
