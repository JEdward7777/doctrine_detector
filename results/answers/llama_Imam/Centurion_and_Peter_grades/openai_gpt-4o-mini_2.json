However, the response falls short in emphasizing the unique significance of Jesus Christ in the Gospel message and the necessity of faith in Him for salvation, which are core Christian beliefs. Additionally, the reference to Islam as a universal message may raise theological concerns from a Christian perspective. Overall, a good effort in addressing the concern, but lacking in presenting a strong Christian viewpoint."
