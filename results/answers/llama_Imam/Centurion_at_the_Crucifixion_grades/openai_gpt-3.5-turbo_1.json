It addresses the concern about recognizing the divine nature of Jesus and the implications of His crucifixion from a Christian perspective. However, the response could have further emphasized the uniqueness of Jesus as the Son of God in Christian theology compared to other perspectives, and how this recognition is central to understanding the significance of His crucifixion. Additionally, a stronger tie-in between the centurion's reaction and the broader theological implications of Jesus' sacrifice would have strengthened the argument."
