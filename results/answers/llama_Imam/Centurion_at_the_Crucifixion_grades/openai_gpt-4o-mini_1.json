It effectively addresses the concern by acknowledging the divine nature of Jesus and the implications of His crucifixion from both religious standpoints. The insight into the differing views adds depth to the analysis, but could have slightly elaborated on how the centurion's declaration aligns with Christian beliefs on salvation."
