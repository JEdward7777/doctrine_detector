While it acknowledges the centrality of the centurion's declaration in Christian theology, it falls short in fully addressing the concern by not explicitly affirming the Christian belief in Jesus as the divine Son of God and the ultimate significance of His crucifixion for salvation. Additional emphasis on these key Christian beliefs would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
