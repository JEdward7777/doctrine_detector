  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and respectful explanation of the qualities that define an upright person in the biblical context. They accurately highlighted key virtues such as righteousness, humility, justice, and compassion as essential characteristics of an upright individual. However, the student's understanding may be limited in terms of the depth of biblical theology and the specific Christian worldview. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic perspective, while appreciated for comparative purposes, slightly detracts from the focus on defining biblical uprightness."
