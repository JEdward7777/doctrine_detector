However, from a Christian worldview perspective, there are theological differences between Judaism and Christianity regarding the priesthood, especially in light of the fulfillment of priesthood in Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest. Additionally, phrasing such as \"May Allah guide us all\" reflects a different religious worldview than Christianity, which should be considered in a response specific to a Christian perspective."
