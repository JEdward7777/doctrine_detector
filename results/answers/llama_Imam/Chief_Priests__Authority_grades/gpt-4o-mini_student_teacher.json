  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the priesthood structure in ancient Jewish tradition, their answer did not directly address the concern of the relationship between the chief priests and ordinary priests in terms of authority. The reference answer clearly states that chief priests held a higher rank and power than ordinary priests, with the high priest having the most authority. The student's response, although informative, did not clearly articulate this hierarchical relationship, resulting in a lower grade."
