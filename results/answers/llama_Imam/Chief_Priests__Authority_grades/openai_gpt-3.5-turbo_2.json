  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the relationship between chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Jewish tradition during the Second Temple period. It accurately states that the High Priest held supreme authority and that the ordinary priests assisted in Temple rituals. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the hierarchical structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel. However, the response could have further emphasized the role of the High Priest as a mediator between God and the people, highlighting the significance of their duties and responsibilities in the religious context."
