As-salamu alaykum,

In the time of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the early years of Islam, the concept of priestly hierarchy did not exist in Judaism. However, I can provide some insight into the relationship between chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Jewish tradition.

In the Second Temple period, which roughly spanned from 520 BCE to 70 CE, the Jewish priesthood was divided into two main categories: the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) and the ordinary priests (Kohanim).

The High Priest held supreme authority over the Temple rituals and services. He was responsible for performing the daily sacrifices, offering prayers on behalf of the people, and serving as the spiritual leader of the Jewish community. The High Priest was also the chief administrator of the Temple and its finances.

Ordinary priests, on the other hand, were the descendants of Aaron, the brother of Moses. They were responsible for assisting the High Priest in performing the rituals and services at the Temple. Ordinary priests did not have the same level of authority as the High Priest but still played a crucial role in the Temple worship.

In terms of authority, the High Priest held supreme jurisdiction over all matters related to the Temple and its services. The ordinary priests were subject to his guidance and oversight. However, it's important to note that the distinction between the two categories was not as stark as it might seem today. Both the High Priest and the ordinary priests were considered sacred servants of God, and their roles were intertwined in the Temple worship.

May Allah guide us all towards a deeper understanding of His creation.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the relationship between chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Jewish tradition during the Second Temple period. It accurately states that the High Priest held supreme authority and that the ordinary priests assisted in Temple rituals. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the hierarchical structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel. However, the response could have further emphasized the role of the High Priest as a mediator between God and the people, highlighting the significance of their duties and responsibilities in the religious context.
