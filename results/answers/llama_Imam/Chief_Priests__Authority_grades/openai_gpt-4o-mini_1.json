  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response accurately explains the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel, focusing on the distinction between the High Priest and the ordinary priests during the Second Temple period. It effectively addresses the concern by providing relevant historical and religious context within Judaism. The response is well-written and demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic from a historical and religious perspective. The mention of Allah at the end could be seen as slightly out of place within the context of a Christian-specific worldview, hence the slight deduction in points."
