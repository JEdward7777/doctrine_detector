  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** While the student's answer addresses the concern regarding biblical expectations for familial relationships, it is not directly addressing the question posed. The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the importance of honoring parents from an Islamic perspective, but the reference answer seeks a Christian perspective. The grade reflects the relevance of the response to the question but also the deviation from the specified concern."
