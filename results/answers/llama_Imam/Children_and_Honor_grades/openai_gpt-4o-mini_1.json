However, the focus is primarily on Islamic perspectives and teachings regarding honoring parents, deviating somewhat from the specified concern of clarifying the Biblical expectations for familial relationships. The response could have been strengthened by providing more specific references to Biblical passages and emphasizing the Christian worldview on this topic."
