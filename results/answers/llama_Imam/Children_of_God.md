Assalamu alaikum, dear brother/sister in faith.

The concept of being referred to as "children of God" (Abna' Allah) is a beautiful and significant aspect of our Islamic faith. This notion is rooted in the Quranic verse: "And when your Lord inspired the bees, saying: 'Take your dwellings in the mountains and on trees and in what He guided you.' So they took their dwellings as He guided them." (Quran 16:68)

In this context, Allah (SWT) addresses His creation, including humans, as "children" or "Abna'." This term signifies a deep affectionate relationship between the Creator and the created. It implies that we are not just mere subjects of a divine monarch but are, in fact, an integral part of God's family.

This concept has profound implications on our relationship with Allah (SWT). Here are some key takeaways:

1. Parental Guidance: As children of God, we are entrusted to His guidance and care. This understanding encourages us to seek knowledge, wisdom, and mercy from our Lord, just as a child seeks guidance from their parent.
2. Unconditional Love: The term "children" implies unconditional love and acceptance from Allah (SWT). This understanding should inspire us to reciprocate with devotion, obedience, and gratitude towards Him.
3. Accountability: As children of God, we are accountable for our actions and decisions in this life. This realization should motivate us to strive for spiritual growth, moral excellence, and righteous deeds.
4. Proximity: The concept of being "children" conveys a sense of closeness and intimacy with Allah (SWT). It encourages us to cultivate a strong bond with Him through prayer, remembrance, and devotion.
5. Mercy: As children of God, we are deserving of His mercy and forgiveness. This understanding should inspire us to seek pardon and guidance in our daily lives.

In conclusion, being referred to as "children of God" emphasizes the depth of our connection with Allah (SWT). It reminds us that we are not just mere mortals but are an integral part of God's family, deserving of His love, guidance, and mercy. May this understanding bring us closer to our Lord and inspire us to live a life pleasing to Him.

Was-salamu alaikum!
