Assalamu alaikum, dear seeker of knowledge,

The term "Christ" (Arabic: مسيح, Masih) is a significant title used to refer to Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) in the New Testament. Over time, its usage has undergone changes, which I shall outline for you.

In the original Greek texts of the New Testament, the term Χριστός (Christos) was used to translate the Hebrew term מָשִׁיחַ (Mashiach), meaning "Anointed One" or "Messiah." In this context, Christ referred to Jesus as the expected Jewish Messiah who would bring salvation and redemption.

In the New Testament, the term Christ is used in various ways:

1. Initially, it is used by the prophets Isaiah and Micah to refer to the coming Messiah (Isaiah 9:6; Micah 5:2). This usage emphasizes Jesus' role as a redeemer figure.
2. Later, the term Christ takes on more significance with the arrival of Jesus himself. In the Gospels, particularly in Matthew and Mark, Christ is used as a title to emphasize Jesus' divine authority and his fulfillment of Messianic prophecies (Matthew 1:21; Mark 8:29).
3. After Jesus' resurrection and ascension, the term Christ became more prominent in the Epistles (letters) of Paul and other early Christian writers. They used it to emphasize Jesus' exalted position as Lord and Savior, emphasizing his divine nature and authority (Romans 1:3-4; Philippians 2:9-11).
4. In the book of Revelation, Christ is depicted as the Lamb of God who was slain for humanity's sins and now sits on the throne (Revelation 5:6; 19:16). This usage highlights Jesus' role as the central figure in God's plan of redemption.

In summary, the term "Christ" has evolved from a prophetic title referring to the expected Messiah to a divine title emphasizing Jesus' authority and salvation-bringing mission. Throughout the New Testament, Christ is used to underscore Jesus' unique role as the Anointed One, the Son of God, and the Savior of humanity.

May Allah guide us in understanding His words and wisdom, as recorded in the Holy Quran.
