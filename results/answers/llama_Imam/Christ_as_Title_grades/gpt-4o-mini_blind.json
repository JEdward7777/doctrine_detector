However, the inclusion of Islamic references and the statement \"May Allah guide us in understanding His words and wisdom, as recorded in the Holy Quran\" detracts from the Christian-specific worldview required for this question. Additionally, the response could be improved by including more scriptural references and emphasizing Jesus as the unique and divine Son of God, rather than solely focusing on his role as a prophet."
