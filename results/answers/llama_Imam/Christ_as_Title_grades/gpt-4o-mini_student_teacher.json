  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of how the term \"Christ\" evolved in its usage throughout the New Testament, highlighting its significance and various contexts. However, the response lacked a Christian-specific worldview and instead incorporated Islamic terminology and references to Allah and the Quran. To deepen the understanding of Jesus's identity and purpose, it is essential to focus on the Christian perspective, emphasizing the significance of Jesus as the Son of God and the Savior. The student's answer would have been stronger with a more distinct Christian worldview and theological analysis."
