The suggestions offered for Christians to consider incorporating principles of ritual cleanliness inspired by the Old Testament align well with the concern of enhancing spiritual growth and accountability through ancient teachings. The Imam's respectful and inclusive approach promotes understanding and harmony between people of different faiths."
