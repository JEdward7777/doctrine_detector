  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the concept of a clear conscience in Islamic teachings and drew parallels with Christian teachings. However, the student failed to explicitly address the concern provided, which is the importance of maintaining a clear conscience in alignment with God's will. The answer was well-written and informative but lacked the necessary focus on the specific Christian perspective outlined in the concern."
