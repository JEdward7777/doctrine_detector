The integration of Islamic teachings and references contributes to a deeper understanding of the concept. However, from a Christian worldview, while there are similarities in the value placed on maintaining a clear conscience, the ultimate focus is on the atonement provided by Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, which is not explicitly mentioned in the response. Despite this, the response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of maintaining a clear conscience for spiritual health and alignment with God's will."
