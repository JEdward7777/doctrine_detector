The inclusion of Islamic teachings and practices adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could have strengthened its Christian-specific focus by delving deeper into how maintaining a clear conscience is directly tied to the Christian beliefs of personal salvation, redemption, and the forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ."
