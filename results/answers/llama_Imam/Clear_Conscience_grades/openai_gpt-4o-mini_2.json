However, it falls short of addressing the concern that maintaining a clear conscience is vital for spiritual health and alignment with God's will. The response should have explicitly connected the idea of a clear conscience in Islam to its role in spiritual health and alignment with Allah's will, providing a more direct comparison with the Christian perspective outlined in the given answer."
