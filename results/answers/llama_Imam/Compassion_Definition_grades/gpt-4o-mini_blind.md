## [Answer](../Compassion_Definition.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must note that while we Muslims do not consider the Bible to be a primary source of guidance, it is important for us to understand the teachings of our fellow monotheistic believers. In this case, let's explore how the Bible defines compassion and what actions are associated with being compassionate.

In the Bible, compassion is often described as having pity or mercy on others. The Hebrew word "raham" (רחמ) is translated as "compassion" in many instances. For example, Psalm 72:13 says, "Have compassion on him, O Lord, for he is wearied from his cares." Similarly, Micah 6:8 instructs, "And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and love mercy [compassion] and walk humbly with your God."

In terms of actions associated with being compassionate, the Bible emphasizes empathy, kindness, and helping those in need. Jesus Christ, in particular, is often depicted as showing compassion to those around him. For instance:

* Luke 10:33-34 tells the story of a Samaritan who showed compassion to an injured traveler by taking care of his wounds and providing for his needs.
* Matthew 9:36 describes Jesus' response to a crowd's need, saying, "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless."
* Luke 7:13-15 recounts Jesus' healing of a widow's only son, which is attributed to his compassion.

In the Bible, compassion is not limited to specific individuals or groups; it is a general principle for how believers should interact with one another. For example:

* Leviticus 19:18 commands, "Do not seek revenge against others or cherish anger, but teach others to love their neighbors as themselves."
* Galatians 6:2 instructs, "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ."

In summary, the Bible defines compassion as having pity on others, showing empathy, kindness, and helping those in need. These actions are not unique to Christianity; they are a universal aspect of human morality that transcends religious boundaries.

As Muslims, we also emphasize compassion and mercy (rahma) in our faith. We believe in treating all humans with respect, kindness, and generosity, regardless of their background or circumstances. Our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us to show compassion to others, saying, "None of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself" (Bukhari).

Grade: 80

Comments: The student has provided a well-researched and respectful response regarding the Christian perspective on compassion as found in the Bible. They accurately reference relevant Biblical passages and illustrate the importance of compassion through the teachings and actions of Jesus Christ. The student also effectively highlights how compassion transcends religious boundaries and is a universal moral principle. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial for the student to incorporate more explicit connections to Christian theology and doctrine, such as the sacrificial nature of Christ's compassion or the role of compassion in the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the theological significance of compassion within Christianity.
