The incorporation of various biblical passages and stories, along with explanations on the actions associated with compassion, demonstrates a deep understanding of how compassion guides actions towards others according to the Bible. Additionally, drawing parallels between Christian teachings on compassion and the emphasis on compassion and mercy in Islam further enriches the discussion."
