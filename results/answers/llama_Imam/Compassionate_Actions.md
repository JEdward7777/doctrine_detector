## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must emphasize that our sacred book, the Quran, is the word of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, I can try to provide some examples of compassion from the Bible, keeping in mind that it is not my primary source of guidance.

From what I've studied, here are a few examples:

1. The story of Rahab the prostitute (Joshua 2:1-21) - Despite being an outcast and a sinner, Rahab showed kindness to the Israelites who were on a mission from God, hiding them in her home and risking her own life by lying about their presence.

2. The parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) - A stranger helps a wounded traveler at great personal cost, exemplifying compassion, empathy, and selflessness.

3. Jesus' teachings on loving one's neighbor (Mark 12:28-34) - Jesus emphasizes that the second greatest commandment is to "love your neighbor as yourself" (Luke 10:27), which requires treating others with kindness, mercy, and compassion.

4. The story of Job (Job 1-42) - Despite facing immense suffering and loss, Job remains faithful and compassionate towards his friends who came to comfort him.

5. The Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:1-26) - Jesus shows compassion to a woman considered an outcast by society, engaging in conversation with her and revealing His true nature.

These examples illustrate how individuals in the Bible demonstrated compassion, empathy, and kindness towards others, despite their differences or circumstances. May we all strive to emulate these qualities in our daily lives.

Remember, as Muslims, we are commanded to show compassion and mercy (rahma) to all creation, regardless of faith or background. Our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) exemplified this by showing kindness to those who were different from him, like the Jewish scholars he encountered during his travels. May Allah guide us on our journey towards being compassionate and merciful servants of humanity.
