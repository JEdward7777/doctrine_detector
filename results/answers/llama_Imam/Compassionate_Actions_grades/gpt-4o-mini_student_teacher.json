  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from the Bible that demonstrate compassion, albeit some examples may have not been as directly related to the concern of real-life applications of compassion. The student's answer also included a significant amount of information on Islamic beliefs and teachings which, while interesting, did not directly address the question asked. There is room for improvement in focusing more on the specific examples from the Bible that directly showcase compassion in action."
