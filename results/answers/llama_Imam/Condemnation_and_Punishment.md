## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that the Bible is not considered authoritative scripture within Islam, but rather a previous revelation to the People of the Book. However, for the sake of interfaith dialogue and understanding, I will engage with your question.

Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 are passages that convey a message about God's justice and mercy. Here's how these teachings might shape our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation:

Matthew 12:7 (KJV): "And if ye had known what greatness of things ye would have asked Him, but now ask in His name that your joy might be full."

In this passage, Jesus is quoting Hosea 11:1, where God says, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called My son out of Egypt." This verse highlights God's love and mercy towards Israel, emphasizing the importance of seeking God's guidance. The implication is that punishment is not about condemnation but rather correction and restoration.

Psalm 34:22 (KJV): "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled."

This psalm highlights the desire for righteousness as a blessing, emphasizing the importance of seeking God's guidance. The verse can be seen as encouraging individuals to seek justice and correction, rather than condemnation.

In Islamic teachings, Allah (God) is often described as the Most Merciful and the All-Forgiving. In the Quran, it is stated that "And whoever does evil or wrongs himself, excepting those who repent and believe and do good deeds, for those Allah will turn back their evil deeds and forgive them" (Quran 25:70).

In Islam, punishment is not viewed as a form of condemnation but rather as correction and rehabilitation. The purpose of punishment is to reform the individual and deter others from committing similar mistakes. This perspective is reflected in the Quranic verse, "O you who have believed, the righteous women and the righteous men - indeed they are guardians one for another" (Quran 70:30). This emphasizes the importance of mutual accountability and support within the community.

In conclusion, while Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 may not be considered authoritative scripture in Islam, their emphasis on God's love, mercy, and guidance can be seen as aligning with Islamic teachings. The Quranic verses that I mentioned earlier emphasize the importance of seeking correction, rehabilitation, and mutual accountability within the community, rather than punishment being a form of condemnation.
