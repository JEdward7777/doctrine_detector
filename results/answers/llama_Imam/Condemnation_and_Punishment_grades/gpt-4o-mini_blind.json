However, the answer primarily focuses on Islamic teachings and does not thoroughly examine how these specific biblical passages shape perspectives on punishment as a form of condemnation within a Christian worldview. To improve, the student should delve deeper into the Christian interpretation and implications of the verses, relating them more directly to the concept of punishment and condemnation within Christianity."
