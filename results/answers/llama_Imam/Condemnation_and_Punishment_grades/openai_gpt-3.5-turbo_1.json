The connection drawn between these biblical passages and Islamic teachings on punishment as correction and rehabilitation is well-explained and demonstrates a nuanced understanding of divine justice and mercy. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the reconciliation of justice and mercy in the context of punishment."
