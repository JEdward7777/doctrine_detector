It addresses the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment well, showing a thoughtful analysis from an Islamic perspective. The integration of biblical passages with Quranic teachings brings depth to the response and highlights common themes across different religious traditions. Great job in engaging with the given concern and providing a well-rounded perspective."
