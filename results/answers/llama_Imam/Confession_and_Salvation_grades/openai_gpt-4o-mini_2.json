  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response adequately addresses the specified concern by discussing the theological implications of confession and belief according to Paul's writings. However, the grade is lower due to the significant deviation from a Christian worldview in the analysis, particularly in the rejection of Jesus as the Son of God and the concept of vicarious atonement. The explanation from an Islamic perspective is informative but not in line with the Christian specific worldview requested for grading."
