  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student provided a comprehensive overview of how Christians should deal with temptation according to the Bible. However, the student's response lacked a clear Christian perspective and relied heavily on explaining Islamic practices. The response should have focused more explicitly on Christian beliefs, teachings, and scriptures when addressing the question. It's essential for the student to understand and stay within the framework of the Christian worldview when providing guidance on this topic."
