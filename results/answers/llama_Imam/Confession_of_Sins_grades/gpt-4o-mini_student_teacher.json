  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed response on how Christians should deal with temptation according to the Bible, which is commendable. However, the student did not address the importance of confessing sins to God and seeking His forgiveness directly in their response. In a Christian worldview, acknowledging personal sin and seeking God's forgiveness is crucial in overcoming temptations. While the student provided relevant biblical principles, they missed addressing the core aspect of acknowledging personal sin in relation to seeking God's forgiveness, which is central in Christian theology."
