While the response mentions resisting temptation and seeking guidance from God, it does not emphasize the importance of confessing one's sins as a means of experiencing God's forgiveness and strength. The response also strays from the concern by highlighting Islamic practices and providing a brief overview of Christian principles, which are not directly relevant to the original question. Overall, while the response provides some useful information, it could be more focused on addressing the specific concern and providing a more direct answer."
