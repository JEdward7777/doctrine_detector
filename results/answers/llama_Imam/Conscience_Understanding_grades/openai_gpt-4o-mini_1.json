While the answer does not directly align with the given answer or explicitly discuss the role of God in shaping one's conscience, it effectively conveys the importance of conscience in guiding moral decisions and promoting accountability. The response could have been improved by drawing more parallels between Islamic and Christian perspectives on conscience and addressing the role of God in shaping one's conscience."
