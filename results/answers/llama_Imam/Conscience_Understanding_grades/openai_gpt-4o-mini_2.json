The inclusion of references to Hebrew and Greek terms adds depth to the discussion. While the Imam acknowledges his limitations in fully grasping Christian theology, he effectively conveys the importance of conscience and its implications for accountability and guidance in moral choices. The connection between conscience and the \"heart\" as portrayed in the Bible is well-articulated. Overall, this response demonstrates a commendable effort to engage with the Christian perspective on conscience and its relevance to ethical decision-making."
