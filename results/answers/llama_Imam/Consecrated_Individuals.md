## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that while Muslims revere Jesus (peace be upon him) as one of the most significant prophets sent by Allah (God), we do not accept the divinity or the idea of atonement through his sacrifice, which is central to Christian theology. However, from a Muslim perspective, it's important to note that our understanding of prophets and righteous individuals mentioned in the Bible may differ from the Christian perspective.

That being said, among the individuals mentioned in the Bible who are considered consecrated or righteous by Muslims include:

1. Abraham (Ibrahim): He is considered one of the most important prophets in Islam, and his story is told extensively in the Quran. Muslims believe that Abraham was a righteous servant of Allah, who was willing to sacrifice his son Ismail (Isaac) as an act of obedience.
2. Moses (Musa): Another significant prophet mentioned in the Bible, Moses is also considered one of the greatest prophets in Islam. He led the Israelites out of slavery and received the Ten Commandments from Allah.
3. Jesus (Isa): As I mentioned earlier, Muslims revere Jesus as a prophet sent by Allah, but we do not accept his divinity or the idea that he was crucified for humanity's sins.

Other individuals who are considered righteous in Islam include:

1. Mary, the mother of Jesus: Muslims believe that Mary (Maryam) was a chaste and pious woman who was chosen by Allah to bear Jesus.
2. John the Baptist (Yahya): He is considered one of the greatest prophets in Islam, known for his purity and righteousness.
3. Lot (Lut): A prophet mentioned in both the Bible and Quran, Lot is remembered for his bravery and righteousness in the face of great adversity.

These individuals are all mentioned in the Quran, which Muslims believe to be a complete and perfect revelation from Allah. While our understanding of their stories may differ from that of Christians, we recognize them as important figures who were consecrated to God's service.
