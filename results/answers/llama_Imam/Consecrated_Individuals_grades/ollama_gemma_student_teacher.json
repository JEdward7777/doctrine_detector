They acknowledge the differences between Muslim and Christian perspectives on prophets and righteous individuals, while still identifying several individuals who are considered consecrated or righteous by Muslims. The student's inclusion of biblical references and explanations of Islamic beliefs adds depth to their response. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct connection to the provided reference answer, which specifically mentions priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child."
