However, from a Christian worldview, there is a divergence in beliefs regarding the significance and nature of consecrated individuals. It is important to recognize the fundamental Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the ultimate consecrated individual who serves as the divine sacrifice for the atonement of sins, a concept not addressed in the response."
