It effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the significance of consecrated individuals in biblical history from a Muslim perspective. However, the response could have further emphasized the Christian view on consecration and expanded on how these individuals played specific roles in biblical history, which would have strengthened the connection between the two faiths in this context."
