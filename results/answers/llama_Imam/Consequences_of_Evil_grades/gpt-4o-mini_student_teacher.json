  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured response comparing Islamic and Christian perspectives on the consequences of evil. They effectively referenced Quranic verses and biblical examples to illustrate their points. However, the response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern about understanding the impact of evil actions on communities and relationships in light of biblical teachings. The student focused more on individual accountability rather than the broader societal implications of evil actions as indicated in the reference answer."
