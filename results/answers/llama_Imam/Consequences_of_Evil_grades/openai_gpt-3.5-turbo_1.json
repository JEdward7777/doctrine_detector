It correctly addresses the concern by discussing how evil actions can lead to personal and societal turmoil, aligning with biblical teachings. The response effectively incorporates relevant scripture from both the Quran and the Bible to support the argument. However, the response could have further expanded on the redemptive aspect of consequences for evil in a Christian worldview, such as the possibility of forgiveness and redemption through Christ."
