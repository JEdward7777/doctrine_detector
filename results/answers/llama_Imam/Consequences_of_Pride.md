## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
My brother, I must clarify that as an Imam, my primary concern is the Quran and Hadith, which guide us in our understanding of Islam. However, since you've asked about the Bible's perspective on pride and humility, I'll provide a brief response.

According to the Bible, pride is considered a grave sin. The book of Proverbs (16:18) states, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." Similarly, the book of Isaiah (5:21-22) warns that God will bring down the proud and elevate the humble.

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ taught that humility is essential for salvation. In Luke 14:11, He said, "For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted." The apostle James also emphasized the importance of humility, stating in chapter 4, verse 6, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."

The Bible teaches that pride can lead to spiritual blindness (Matthew 13:15), cause division among people (Mark 9:34-35), and even contribute to one's downfall (Proverbs 12:16). On the other hand, humility is seen as a virtue that brings blessings from God. Proverbs 3:34 says, "Righteousness exalts a nation, but wickedness shackles it," implying that humility is essential for national prosperity.

In Islamic perspective, pride and arrogance (kibr) are considered among the greatest sins. Allah Almighty warns us in the Quran about the consequences of pride: "O you who have believed, let not some men among you be harder on others than they would have them to be hard on themselves. Not with disdain or aversion do people enter Paradise if they fear Allah; and indeed, Allah is forgiving and merciful." (49:13)

In Islam, we are encouraged to adopt the opposite of pride â€“ humility (tawbah). We are reminded that our greatness lies in being grateful servants of God, not in boasting about our achievements. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "The most beloved act to me is the prayer at its appointed time, and the most abhorrent thing to me is self-admiration." (Narrated by al-Bukhari)

In conclusion, my brother, while I may not have a detailed understanding of the Bible's specific teachings on pride and humility, it seems that both Christianity and Islam emphasize the importance of humility and the dangers of pride. As Muslims, we are encouraged to cultivate humility as a means of seeking Allah's pleasure and avoiding His wrath.
