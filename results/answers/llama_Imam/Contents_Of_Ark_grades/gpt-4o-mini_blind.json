However, from a Christian worldview, there are doctrinal inaccuracies present. The Ark of the Covenant, as described in the Bible, housed the tablets of the Ten Commandments, not the staff of Aaron or Moses' staff. Additionally, while acknowledging the significance of the Ark in Islamic tradition, the Christian perspective emphasizes the covenant between God and the Israelites, viewing the Ark as a physical representation of His presence among His chosen people. Further discussion on the Christian understanding of the Ark's role in Old Testament history and its typological significance in relation to Christ would enhance the response."
