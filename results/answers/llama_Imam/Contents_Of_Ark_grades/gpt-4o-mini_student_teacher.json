  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates knowledge about the significance of the Ark of the Covenant in Islamic tradition and provides relevant information from Islamic sources. However, the focus of the question was on the items contained within the Ark of the Covenant in the Judeo-Christian context, not the Islamic perspective. The answer did not align closely with the specified concern of learning about the reminders of God's covenant with the Israelites. Additionally, the specific items listed differ from the reference answer provided by the teacher."
