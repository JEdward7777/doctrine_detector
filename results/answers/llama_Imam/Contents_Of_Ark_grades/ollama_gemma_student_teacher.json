  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the contents of the Ark of the Covenant from a Islamic perspective. They accurately list the three items traditionally believed to be contained within the Ark, citing both Quranic and hadith sources. The inclusion of information about the Ark's construction and its significance in the story of Moses adds depth and context to the response. While the answer aligns well with Islamic beliefs, it does not directly address the specific concern regarding reminders of God's covenant with the Israelites as outlined in the prompt."
