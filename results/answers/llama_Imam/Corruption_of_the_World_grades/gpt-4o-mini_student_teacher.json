  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response, while well-thought-out and informative, does not align with the Christian worldview specified in the reference answer. The student's perspective as a Muslim and references to Islamic beliefs and practices are not relevant to the specific Christian-focused question and concern provided. Additionally, the student's suggestions for identifying corrupt influences do not directly tie back to biblical teachings and the promotion of godly living. The response lacks a clear connection to the core values and principles of Christianity, resulting in a low grade."
