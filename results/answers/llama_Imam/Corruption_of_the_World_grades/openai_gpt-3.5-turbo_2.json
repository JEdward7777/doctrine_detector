However, the inclusion of references to Islamic beliefs and terminology, such as \"peace be upon him\" when mentioning Jesus and invoking Allah, may not align with a Christian worldview. Additionally, the response could have focused more on explicitly biblical teachings and principles as the foundation for identifying corruption, rather than incorporating teachings and beliefs from another faith tradition.
