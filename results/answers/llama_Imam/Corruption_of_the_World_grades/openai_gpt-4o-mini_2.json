  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the concern of remaining vigilant against corrupt influences that may lead away from godly living, it primarily focuses on shared values and actions from a Muslim perspective. The response does not directly address the Christian-specific concern provided. The response does offer valuable insights on identifying corrupt influences, but it lacks a direct connection to biblical teachings as requested. It is important to ensure that the response directly addresses the concern from a Christian worldview."
