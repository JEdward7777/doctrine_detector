# Generated Answer from [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md) for [Covenant Conditions](../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)

## Question [Covenant Conditions](../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)
What are some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible?

## Target answer from notes
An example of an unconditional covenant is God's promise to never destroy the earth again with a flood. In contrast, conditional covenants require obedience from the people, such as the covenant at Sinai where God said, 'If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant...'

## Concern to grade by
Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must emphasize that the concept of covenant (ahd) is central to Islamic theology as well. In Islam, we believe that Allah (God) made a covenant with Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, among others.

Regarding conditional covenants in the Bible, some examples include:

1. The Covenant between God and Noah: This covenant was conditional upon humanity's behavior. If humanity repented and followed God's commands, the covenant would be fulfilled; otherwise, a flood would destroy all life.
2. The Mosaic Covenant (Torah): This covenant was also conditional. If the Israelites kept the commandments and laws given through Moses, they would remain in the Promised Land; if they disobeyed, they would face consequences such as exile or punishment.
3. The Davidic Covenant: This covenant promised that David's dynasty would endure if his descendants remained faithful to God.

As for unconditional covenants in the Bible:

1. The Abrahamic Covenant: Allah made an unconditional promise to Abraham that he and his descendants would be blessed, even though Abraham was a sinner (Genesis 12:3).
2. The New Covenant: Jesus Christ's sacrifice was seen as an unconditional gift of salvation, available to all who put their faith in Him (John 1:29; Romans 6:23).

It is essential to note that the concept of covenant (ahd) is a fundamental aspect of both Islam and Christianity. In Islam, we believe that Allah made covenants with various prophets, including Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, among others.

In Islamic theology, an unconditional covenant is one where Allah's promise is not contingent upon human behavior or actions. Instead, it is based on His mercy and wisdom. For example, the Covenant of Mercy (Ahd al-Rahma) between Allah and Adam was unconditional, as Allah forgave Adam's sin and made him a vicegerent on earth.

In Islam, we also believe that the covenant between Allah and Muhammad (peace be upon him) is an unconditional one, where Allah chose Muhammad to receive revelation and guidance for humanity. This covenant is based on Allah's mercy and wisdom, rather than any human actions or conditions.

I hope this clarifies the concept of conditional and unconditional covenants in both Islamic and Biblical contexts.
