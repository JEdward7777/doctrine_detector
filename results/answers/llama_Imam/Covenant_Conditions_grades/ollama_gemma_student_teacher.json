  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of conditional and unconditional covenants in both Islamic and Biblical contexts. \n\nThe student clearly explains the concept of covenant in Islamic theology and highlights similarities between Islamic and Christian beliefs about covenants. \n\nThe student's examples of conditional and unconditional covenants are well-chosen and supported by relevant biblical references. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants, as per the specified concern. The student's explanation of the covenant between God and Muhammad as unconditional could also be strengthened by referencing relevant Islamic sources."
