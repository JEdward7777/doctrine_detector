  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: \nWhile the student attempted to provide an overview of the biblical concept of covenant, the response lacks clarity and depth in its explanation. The student correctly identifies key biblical covenants and their significance, but the explanation could be more focused and detailed. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives on covenants, while informative, was not necessary and detracted from providing a more in-depth analysis of the biblical definition of a covenant. The response could benefit from a more structured and doctrinally focused explanation based on Christian beliefs."
