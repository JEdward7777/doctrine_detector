However, the student's perspective as a Muslim Imam and the emphasis on Islamic theology, while informative, detracted from a focused explanation of the biblical definition of a covenant. The response could have been improved by more directly addressing the concern of understanding the nature of covenants in biblical contexts and providing a clearer and more concise definition based on a Christian worldview."
