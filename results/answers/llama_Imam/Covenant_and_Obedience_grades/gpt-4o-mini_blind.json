However, the grading is fairly low due to the lack of doctrinal accuracy from a Christian worldview. The introduction of Islamic concepts and beliefs, such as references to the Quran and Allah, deviates significantly from a Christian-specific understanding of the Israelites' journey in relation to obedience to God's laws. The answer would benefit from focusing on biblical references and Christian teachings to address the question adequately."
