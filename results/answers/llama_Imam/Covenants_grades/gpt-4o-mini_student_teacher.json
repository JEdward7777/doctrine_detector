  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and respectful analysis of the biblical covenants from an Islamic perspective while acknowledging the importance of the Bible to Christians. They offered relevant examples and explanations of God's commitment to His people as portrayed through the covenants. However, the student's response focused more on Islamic interpretations and beliefs rather than directly addressing the Christian-specific worldview in the question. While their analysis was informative and well-written, a stronger connection to the Christian perspective on God's commitment through biblical covenants would have enhanced the response."
