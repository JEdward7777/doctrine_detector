  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. However, the response focused more on providing general information rather than directly addressing the specified concern about how cultural norms influence faith communities and practices. The student also made insightful connections between Jewish traditions and early Christian developments, but could have delved deeper into the implications of these influences on the early church. Overall, a solid effort but lacking in direct alignment with the concern provided."
