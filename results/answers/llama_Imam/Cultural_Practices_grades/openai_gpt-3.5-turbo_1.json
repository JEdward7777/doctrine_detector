The incorporation of historical context and the development of early Christian practices within the Jewish framework adds depth to the response. Additionally, the recognition of the transformative power of Jesus' teachings in challenging traditional cultural practices highlights a nuanced perspective on the evolution of faith communities. Great job!"
