The integration of a Muslim Imam's perspective adds depth to the analysis from a broader religious worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices. However, a slightly stronger connection to the specific Jewish cultural practices mentioned in the original answer could further enhance the analysis."
