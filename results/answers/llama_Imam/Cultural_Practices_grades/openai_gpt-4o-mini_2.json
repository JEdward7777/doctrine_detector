  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-explained overview of how cultural norms influenced early Jewish and Christian practices, specifically focusing on the relationship between Jews and Gentiles. The student effectively connects the provided answer about Jews avoiding eating and associating with Gentiles to the broader context of inclusivity and acceptance in the early church. The analysis demonstrates a good understanding of how cultural norms shape faith communities and practices, and the integration of a Christian worldview perspective is clear and appropriate."
