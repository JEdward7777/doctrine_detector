  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided by the Muslim Imam acknowledges the broader theological implications of sin and the need for redemption, albeit from an Islamic perspective. While the Imam draws parallels between the curse on the snake and the consequences of disobedience in Islam, the response does not explicitly address the promise of redemption through Christ as underscored in the given answer. Therefore, the grade is average as the theological perspective presented is not aligned with the Christian worldview."
