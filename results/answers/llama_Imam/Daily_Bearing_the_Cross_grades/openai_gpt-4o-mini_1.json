It acknowledges the uniqueness of the concept in Christian theology while drawing parallels to Islamic teachings on self-discipline and submission to God's will. The response shows respect for both Christian and Islamic beliefs and effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the personal cost and commitment required in following Christ. Further integration of scriptural references from the Qur'an related to self-sacrifice and submission could enhance the response."
