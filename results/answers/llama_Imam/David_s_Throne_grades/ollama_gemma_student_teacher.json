  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student has provided a well-researched and respectful response that addresses the concern of understanding the promise of David's throne lasting forever in Christian theology. The student correctly identifies the biblical references and explains the significance of the promise in Christian belief. However, the student's clarification at the end regarding the absence of this concept in Islamic theology is a valuable addition to the overall response."
