It acknowledges the importance of this promise in recognizing the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus. However, it falls short in fully embracing the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the unique significance of Him sitting on David's throne. There is a respectful comparison made to Islamic theology, but the focus should have remained on articulating the Christian understanding more clearly."
