Assalamu alaikum, brother.

The term "Day of the Lord" (or "Day of Yahweh") is a phrase used extensively throughout the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. In the Muslim perspective, we acknowledge the prophets preceding Muhammad (peace be upon him), including those mentioned in the New Testament, such as Jesus (peace be upon him).

In the context of the New Testament, the term "Day of the Lord" typically refers to a period of judgment and reckoning, when God will intervene in human affairs, bring an end to this world's chaos, and establish His kingdom. It is often associated with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him).

This concept is rooted in Jewish eschatology, where it was believed that Yahweh would one day return to judge humanity, reward the righteous, and punish the wicked. In the New Testament, this idea is adapted to fit the Christian context, with Jesus Christ being seen as the bringer of judgment and salvation.

Some examples of "Day of the Lord" in the New Testament include:

1. Matthew 24:30-31 - Jesus speaks of a future time when He will come on the clouds of heaven, gather His elect, and judge all nations.
2. Revelation 6:17 - In this apocalyptic passage, John writes about a great tribulation that will precede the Day of the Lord, when God will judge humanity with fire and sulfur.
3. Zephaniah 1:14-18 (cited in Luke 21:26) - This Old Testament passage is often referred to as an example of "Day of the Lord" in Jewish eschatology.

In Islamic theology, we have our own concept of Qiyamah (the Resurrection), where the righteous will be rewarded and the wicked punished. While there are similarities between the Day of the Lord and Qiyamah, they have distinct differences in their specific contexts and interpretations.

I hope this helps clarify the meaning of "Day of the Lord" in the New Testament from an Islamic perspective. May Allah guide us towards the truth.
