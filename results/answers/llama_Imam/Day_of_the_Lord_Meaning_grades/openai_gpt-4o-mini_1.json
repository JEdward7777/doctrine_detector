The comparison between the Christian concept of the Day of the Lord and Islamic concept of Qiyamah helps to illustrate the significance and implications of the Day of the Lord for believers. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on how the Day of the Lord impacts believers specifically and how they should prepare for this judgment day in light of their faith."
