  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed comparison of the roles of deacons in Christianity with various Islamic concepts related to serving the Muslim community. The student successfully highlighted similarities in serving others and promoting unity. However, the answer did not address the primary role of a deacon in the local church according to Christian beliefs. To receive a higher grade, the student should focus more on the specific duties and responsibilities of deacons as outlined in Christian doctrine."
