  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed comparison between the roles of deacons in Christianity and general Islamic teachings on service, they did not directly address the biblical role of servanthood in the church as requested. The student's response focused more on general concepts of service in Islam rather than delving into the specific biblical role of deacons in the local church. The answer showed some understanding of service and helping others, but lacked a specific focus on the biblical perspective on servanthood within the church context."
