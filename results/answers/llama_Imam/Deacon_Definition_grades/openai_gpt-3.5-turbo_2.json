It appropriately addresses the concern of servanthood within the church by discussing practical service to fellow believers. However, the response could further emphasize the foundation of servanthood in the biblical teachings of Jesus Christ as a model for service and selflessness. Additionally, incorporating specific biblical references on servanthood within the church would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
