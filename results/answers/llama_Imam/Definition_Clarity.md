## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Islamic scholar, I can provide an overview of how Christians understand the concept of adultery based on their sacred text.

In the Christian context, particularly in the Bible, adultery (or fornication) is described as a sinful act of sexual intimacy between two unmarried individuals or between one person and someone who is not their spouse. The relevant passages are found in the Old Testament, specifically in Leviticus 18:6-23 and Deuteronomy 22:13-21.

In Christian theology, adultery is considered a serious moral transgression that violates God's laws and commands. Jesus Christ also spoke against adultery in the New Testament, emphasizing its severity (Matthew 5:27-28).

The Christian understanding of adultery is often tied to the concept of marriage as a sacred institution between one man and one woman, created by God for the purpose of companionship and procreation. Adultery is seen as a betrayal of this covenant and a violation of the trust that exists between spouses.

In summary, in the Christian context, adultery refers to any sexual activity outside of a valid marriage between two consenting adults, or any form of non-consensual sexual contact. It is considered a grave sin that goes against God's will and is punishable by law (Old Testament) and eternal damnation (New Testament).
