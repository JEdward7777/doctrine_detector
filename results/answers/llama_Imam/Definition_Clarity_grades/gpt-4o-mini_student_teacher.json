  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of how Christians understand adultery based on their sacred text, referencing both the Old and New Testament. The student correctly highlighted the seriousness of adultery in Christian theology and its implications for marriage. However, the student could have provided a more precise definition focusing on the act of a married person engaging in sexual relations with someone other than their spouse, as explicitly stated in the Bible. Additionally, the student's perspective as an Islamic scholar may have slightly affected the interpretation of Christian beliefs on adultery."
