  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and informative response that clearly defines adultery from a Christian perspective. It accurately summarizes the biblical definition of adultery and emphasizes its significance within Christian theology. The inclusion of relevant scripture references adds credibility and reinforces the understanding of the concept. However, it would be more appropriate for the student to acknowledge in the introduction that they are addressing a Christian-specific concern, given the specified grading criteria."
