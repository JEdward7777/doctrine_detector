  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of angels from a biblical perspective, addressing their nature, roles, appearances, and specific functions based on Christian theology. While the student appropriately acknowledged their Islamic background and differences in beliefs, the answer could have been more focused on the biblical definition and primary role of angels without extensive comparisons to Islam. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and effectively related it to the concern of deepening faith and assurance of God's protection and guidance."
