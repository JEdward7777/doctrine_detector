# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that our understanding of angels comes from the Quranic revelation, not the Bible. However, since you've asked about the biblical perspective, I'll do my best to provide an overview.

In the Bible, angels are spiritual beings created by God, often referred to as "messengers" or "servants." The primary role of angels is to serve and worship God, carrying out His will on earth. They are believed to be invisible, yet capable of interacting with humans through various means.

The Bible describes angels as having a dual nature: they can appear in human form (e.g., Gabriel's appearance to Mary) or remain invisible. Angels are often depicted as being involved in creation, worship, and service to God. Some biblical passages mention specific angelic roles, such as:

1. Messengers: Angels serve as messengers between God and humanity, conveying divine messages and commands.
2. Intercessors: Angels may intercede on behalf of humans before God, as seen in the story of Abraham's servant Eliezer (Genesis 24).
3. Protectors: Some angels are believed to protect people from harm or evil forces, such as Michael, who is said to have led the heavenly host against Satan (Revelation 12:7-9).

The Bible also describes different types of angels, including:

1. Seraphim: High-ranking angelic beings that surround God's throne and worship Him (Isaiah 6).
2. Cherubim: Large, winged creatures that appear in the biblical accounts of creation (Genesis 3) and the Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 25).

Please note that these concepts are rooted in Christian theology and might differ from Islamic beliefs about angels. In Islam, we believe that angels are created beings who worship God and carry out specific duties as appointed by Allah. We don't have a concept of fallen angels or demons, as this is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran.

If you have further questions or would like to discuss Islamic perspectives on angels, I'm more than happy to engage in a constructive conversation!

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of angels from a biblical perspective, emphasizing their role as messengers and servants of God. It addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding the role of angels can deepen faith and provide assurance of God's protection and guidance. However, there could have been more explicit references to relevant biblical passages to strengthen the argument further.
