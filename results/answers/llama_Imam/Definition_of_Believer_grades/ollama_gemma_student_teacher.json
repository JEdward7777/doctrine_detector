  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of belief from an Islamic perspective. They clearly explain the universal nature of faith and emphasize the importance of accepting the message of one's prophet. However, the response does not address the Christian-specific definition of a believer as someone who believes in and relies on Jesus Christ as Savior. This discrepancy accounts for the slightly lower grade. Overall, the response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the Islamic concept of belief."
