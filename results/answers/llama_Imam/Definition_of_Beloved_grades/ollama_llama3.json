However, it does not fully address the concern of understanding the depth of God's love for Jesus and how that relates to believers.\n\nThe response does mention that the term \"beloved\" is used to describe Jesus' divinity and mission, but it does not delve deeper into the significance of this concept in relation to believers. Additionally, while it mentions the Quranic concept of divine love, it does not provide a clear connection between the two concepts or explore how they might be similar or different.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest that the author provide more specific biblical references and explanations about the depth of God's love for Jesus and its implications for believers. This could include exploring passages such as John 3:16-17, Romans 5:8, or Ephesians 2:4-5 to demonstrate how God's love for Jesus is related to His love for humanity."
