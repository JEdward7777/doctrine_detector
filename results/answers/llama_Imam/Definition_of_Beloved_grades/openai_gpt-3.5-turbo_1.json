However, the response does not fully address the concern of understanding the depth of God's love for Jesus and how that relates to believers. It would have been beneficial to delve deeper into how Jesus being the \"beloved\" Son of God reflects the depth of God's love for Him, and consequently, how believers can also experience God's deep love through their relationship with Jesus. The response effectively highlights the Christian perspective but falls slightly short in fully addressing the specified concern."
