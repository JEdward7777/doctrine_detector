It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of God's love for Jesus in the Christian scriptures and how that relates to believers. The inclusion of relevant biblical passages and Islamic teachings enriches the explanation. However, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of God's love for Jesus and its impact on believers could further enhance the response."
