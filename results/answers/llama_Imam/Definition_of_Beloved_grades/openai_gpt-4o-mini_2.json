The Islamic perspective on the concept of \"beloved\" is also discussed, showing an understanding of the differences between Christianity and Islam. However, the response could have further elaborated on the depth of God's love for Jesus and how that love extends to believers in a more explicit and in-depth manner from a Christian worldview perspective."
