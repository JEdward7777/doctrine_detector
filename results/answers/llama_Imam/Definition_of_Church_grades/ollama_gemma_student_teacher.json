  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of \"church\" in the New Testament. The student correctly emphasizes the spiritual nature of the church as a community of believers, while also acknowledging the physical aspect of local assemblies. The inclusion of reference to the early Christian communities and their practices adds depth to the response. While the student correctly points out the differences between the Christian concept of church and the Islamic understanding of ummah, minor clarity could be achieved by elaborating on the universality of the church as a spiritual entity beyond physical locations."
