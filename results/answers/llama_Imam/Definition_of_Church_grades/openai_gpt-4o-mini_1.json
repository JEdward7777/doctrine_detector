The comparison drawn between the Christian understanding of the church and the Muslim concept of ummah is insightful and adds depth to the analysis. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how the church functions beyond just gathering together, possibly mentioning the mission and purpose of the church in spreading the Gospel and serving others."
