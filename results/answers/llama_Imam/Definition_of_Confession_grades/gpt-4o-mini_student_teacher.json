  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of confession from a Christian perspective, even though they started by emphasizing their Muslim background. However, the student's response did not fully align with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer lacked a succinct definition of confession as simply admitting or asserting that something is true, which is the essence of confession according to the Bible. Additionally, the student's focus on Islamic concepts, although informative, detracted from answering the question solely from a Christian worldview."
