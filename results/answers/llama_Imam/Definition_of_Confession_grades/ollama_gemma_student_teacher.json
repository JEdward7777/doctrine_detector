  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a comprehensive and well-researched response that clearly explains the concept of confession in the Christian tradition and compares it to the Islamic concept of tawbah. They demonstrate a deep understanding of both concepts and present them in a respectful and inclusive manner. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific act of confessing sins in Christian theology and its connection to forgiveness and reconciliation with God."
