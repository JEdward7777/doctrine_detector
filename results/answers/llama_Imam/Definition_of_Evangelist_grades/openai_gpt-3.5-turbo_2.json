The writer effectively acknowledges the different roles of evangelists in Christianity and prophets/ messengers in Islam, highlighting the focus on Tawhid in Islam. However, the response could have strengthened the Christian perspective by emphasizing the central role of evangelists in spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ for the salvation of humanity."
