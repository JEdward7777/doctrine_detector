  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response attempts to provide a comparative analysis of the Biblical and Islamic concepts of good and evil, which is insightful. However, the response strays from the specific concern of understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making. The student should have focused more on connecting the definitions of good and evil to practical examples or scenarios to demonstrate how these concepts guide individual moral decision-making on a daily basis. Overall, the response provides valuable insight but lacks direct relevance to the specified concern."
