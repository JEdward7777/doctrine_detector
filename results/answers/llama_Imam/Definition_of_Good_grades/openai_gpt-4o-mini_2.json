However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of aligning one's actions with God's will in daily decision-making, particularly from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, while the analysis is informative, it could have integrated more explicitly Christian theological concepts to enhance the evaluation through a Christian-specific worldview.\n\n"
