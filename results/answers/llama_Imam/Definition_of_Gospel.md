Assalamu alaikum,

The term "Gospel" (Arabic: إنجيل, Injīl) comes from the Greek word "Euangelion" (Εὐαγγέλιον), which means "good news" or "glad tidings". In the context of the Bible, specifically in the New Testament, the Gospel refers to the message of salvation through Jesus Christ.

In Christian theology, the Four Gospels – Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John – are considered eyewitness accounts of Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection. These accounts provide a record of the "good news" that Jesus is the Son of God, sent to save humanity from sin and its consequences.

In Islamic understanding, the concept of Gospel (Injīl) is mentioned in the Quran as one of the revealed books sent down by Allah to guide humanity. However, Muslims believe that the original message of the Injīl was corrupted over time, and the current Christian Bible does not accurately reflect the original teachings of Jesus.

Muslims also consider some of the stories and teachings found in the Gospels to be compatible with Islamic beliefs and values. For example, many Muslim scholars acknowledge the prophetic nature of Jesus' message and his emphasis on monotheism, morality, and social justice.

In Islamic context, the term "Gospel" is often used to refer to the entire Christian Scriptures, including the Old Testament (Tawrat) and New Testament (Injīl). However, Muslims believe that the Quran is the final and complete revelation from Allah, and it supersedes all previous revelations, including the Gospels.

Wa alaykum salam.
