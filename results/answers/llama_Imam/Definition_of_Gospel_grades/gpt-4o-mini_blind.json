  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student effectively defines the term \"Gospel\" and provides some insight into how it is understood in Christian theology. However, from a Christian perspective, there are some inaccuracies in the explanation, especially regarding the belief that the original message of the Inj\u012bl was corrupted. The understanding of the Gospel in Islam is mentioned correctly, but the response lacks depth in discussing the centrality of the Gospel in Christianity as the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. The discussion could have been more focused on the Christian understanding of the Gospel rather than Islamic beliefs about it."
