  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the term Gospel from an Islamic perspective, including its significance and understanding in Islamic beliefs. However, the answer did not directly address the Christian-specific understanding and significance of the Gospel as required. The response lacked depth in connecting the Gospel to Jesus' sacrifice on the cross for salvation, which is a fundamental aspect of Christian theology. The student demonstrated good knowledge and understanding but missed the Christian worldview focus required for the question."
