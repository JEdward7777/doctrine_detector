However, it falls short in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the significance of the Gospel in Christian faith. The response also deviates from the concern by introducing Islamic perspectives and terminology (e.g., Inj\u012bl, Tawrat), which are not directly relevant to understanding the definition and significance of the Gospel in Christian faith.\n\nTo improve, the response could have focused more on the biblical context and theological importance of the Gospel in Christianity, rather than comparing it with Islamic perspectives. A more detailed discussion of the Four Gospels, their authorship, and the message they convey would also have been helpful in addressing the concern."
