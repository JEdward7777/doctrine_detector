However, the Christian worldview emphasizes that the Gospel is not just about the message of salvation, but it is also centered on the person of Jesus Christ as the Son of God who died for humanity's sins and rose again. The response acknowledges the Christian perspective but could have emphasized Jesus' divinity and the uniqueness of the Gospel in Christianity more explicitly."
