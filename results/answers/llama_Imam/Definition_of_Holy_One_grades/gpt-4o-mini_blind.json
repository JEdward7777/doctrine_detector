  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The response provides an insightful perspective on the term \"Holy One\" from an Islamic viewpoint, discussing the attributes of God and providing relevant references from both the Old and New Testaments. However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. It conflates Islamic beliefs with Christian beliefs, leading to theological inaccuracies. The focus should be on the biblical understanding of the term \"Holy One\" and its significance within Christian theology. The response fails to convey this key aspect, hence the low grade."
