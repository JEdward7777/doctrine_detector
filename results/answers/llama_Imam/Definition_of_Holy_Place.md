As-salamu alaykum, dear brother or sister.

In Islamic theology, we recognize that Allah (SWT) has chosen certain places as sacred and blessed, such as Makkah, Madinah, and Jerusalem. However, it's essential to understand the significance of these holy places within the context of Jewish scripture, specifically in relation to the tabernacle or temple.

In the Old Testament, the concept of a "holy place" is rooted in the idea that God dwells among His people. The tabernacle and later the temple were physical structures built by humans, but they served as a tangible connection between humanity and the Divine. These sacred spaces were meant to facilitate communication with Allah (SWT) through prayer, sacrifice, and worship.

In Jewish tradition, the holy place was considered a threshold between the profane world and the realm of the divine. It was where God's presence was said to reside, making it a site of intense spiritual activity and connection. The Ark of the Covenant, which housed the Ten Commandments, was placed within the tabernacle or temple, emphasizing its role as a symbol of God's covenant with His people.

The significance of these holy places can be understood on several levels:

1. Physical proximity to Allah (SWT): These structures represented a physical connection between humans and God, allowing for direct communication and worship.
2. Spiritual connection: The tabernacle or temple served as a conduit for spiritual experiences, such as visions, revelations, and prophetic insights.
3. Covenantal significance: The Ark of the Covenant was a tangible representation of God's covenant with His people, emphasizing their responsibility to obey and follow His commandments.

In Islamic theology, we recognize that Allah (SWT) is the same God worshiped by Jews and Christians. While our understanding of sacred spaces may differ, we acknowledge the importance of these places in Jewish scripture as a symbol of connection with the Divine. The significance of Makkah, Madinah, and Jerusalem as holy places in Islamic tradition can be seen as an extension of this concept, where these cities serve as thresholds between the physical world and the realm of the divine.

May Allah (SWT) guide us to understand and respect the sacred spaces revered by our fellow believers. Ameen.
