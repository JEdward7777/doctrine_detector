However, there are inaccuracies in conflating Allah (SWT) with the God of the Old Testament and in equating the significance of Makkah, Madinah, and Jerusalem with the holy place in the context of the tabernacle or temple. The focus on Islamic theology, while important, detracts from a thorough explanation of the concept within the specific context of the tabernacle or temple in Jewish tradition. It is essential to maintain doctrinal correctness and specificity when discussing religious themes from different faith traditions."
