  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written and respectful explanation of the significance of the holy place within the tabernacle or temple from an Islamic perspective. However, there is a lacking focus on addressing the concern of understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place specifically in Jewish scripture. The student does touch on the concept of God's presence and the role of the holy place as a connector between humanity and the Divine, which is relevant. To improve the grade, the student should have incorporated more direct references to Jewish scripture and the specific elements within the holy place to align better with the provided reference answer."
