The response lacked depth in explaining the nuances of repentance within the Christian context, which is crucial for fostering genuine spiritual growth. There was also a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the concept of repentance in Christianity, beyond just acknowledging the need for forgiveness and turning back to God."
