  "grade_comment": "I'm grading based on Christian values!\n\nGrade: 95%\n\nComment: This response demonstrates an excellent understanding of repentance in both Christian and Islamic contexts! The Imam's nuanced explanation of repentance as turning away from sin and towards God, as well as their emphasis on seeking forgiveness and genuine remorse, aligns beautifully with the biblical definition. The inclusion of relevant Quranic passages and references to biblical stories (e.g., the prodigal son) adds depth and credibility to the response. While there is no direct quote of the given answer, the explanation effectively conveys the meaning of repentance as turning away from sin and back to God.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be a more explicit connection between the Islamic perspective on repentance (Tawbah) and the biblical definition provided. Nevertheless, this response earns high marks for its thoughtful exploration of repentance across faith traditions, fostering understanding and unity among people of different beliefs."
