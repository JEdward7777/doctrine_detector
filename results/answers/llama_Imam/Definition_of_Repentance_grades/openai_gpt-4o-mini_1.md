## [Answer](../Definition_of_Repentance.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Brother, as a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that my knowledge of the Bible is limited to what Allah has revealed to me through His Word. Repentance in the Christian context is often associated with turning away from sin and towards God. In the Quran, we find similar guidance on the importance of seeking forgiveness and turning back to Allah.

In the Bible, repentance is often linked to faith (Mark 1:15) and involves a change of heart (Acts 3:19). It's described as a process of recognizing one's sinfulness, acknowledging God's sovereignty, and humbling oneself before Him. This can be seen in passages like:

* Luke 15:18-21, where the prodigal son returns to his father, acknowledging his mistakes and seeking forgiveness.
* Matthew 9:10-13, where Jesus emphasizes the need for repentance as a prerequisite for entering God's kingdom.

In Islamic perspective, we also recognize the importance of seeking forgiveness (Tawbah) from Allah. The Quran emphasizes the need for sincere remorse and a willingness to change one's behavior:

"O you who believe, repent [tawbah] to Allah with true intentions and it may be that your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens through which rivers flow" (Quran 9:114).

As Muslims, we understand that our Creator is Merciful and Forgiving. He accepts sincere repentance and promises redemption for those who turn back to Him:

"Allah likes them who turn to Him in repentance and He loves them who purify themselves greatly" (Quran 2:222).

In conclusion, brother, while there may be differences in interpretation between the two faiths, we both agree on the importance of seeking forgiveness and turning back to our Lord. May Allah guide us all towards righteousness and mercy!
