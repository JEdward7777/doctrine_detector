However, the response lacks depth in explaining the doctrinal significance of saints in the New Testament from a Christian worldview. There is a need for a clearer explanation of how saints are viewed in Christianity, particularly focusing on their role as believers set apart by God for a special purpose and their relationship with Christ. Additionally, the response could have included references to key passages in the New Testament that elaborate on the concept of saints."
