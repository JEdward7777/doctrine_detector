  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and informative answer about the concept of \"saints\" in the New Testament from a Muslim perspective. However, they did not directly address the concern of distinguishing between cultural and scriptural interpretations. The answer lacked a clear Christian-specific worldview and focused more on comparing the concept of saints in Christianity and Islam. To improve the grade, the student needs to provide a clearer connection to the Biblical definition of saints as stated in the reference answer."
