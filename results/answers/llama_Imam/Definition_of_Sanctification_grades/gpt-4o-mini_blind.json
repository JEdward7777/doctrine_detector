However, it lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. The explanation of sanctification from a Christian perspective is accurate, but the student could have highlighted the importance of sanctification as a work of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives. Also, there could have been more emphasis on how sanctification is rooted in Christ's work on the cross and the believer's identification with Him in His death and resurrection. The response could have also included more scriptural references to support the points made. Despite the effort to explain the concept from both perspectives, the focus should have been on accurately presenting the Christian view of sanctification."
