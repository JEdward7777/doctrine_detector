However, the student's response could have further emphasized the importance of the role of God's grace in the process of sanctification, as well as the centrality of Christ's atoning sacrifice in making sanctification possible for believers. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the Christian worldview's understanding of sanctification from a distinctively Christian perspective would have enhanced the overall clarity and depth of the response."
