  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-written response discussing wisdom in the Islamic tradition, the concern specifically asked for an explanation based on the biblical concept of wisdom. The student did not directly address the Biblical definition but instead focused on Islamic teachings. To align with the concern, the student should have provided an interpretation of wisdom according to the Bible."
