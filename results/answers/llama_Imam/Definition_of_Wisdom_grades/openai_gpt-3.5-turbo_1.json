  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively elaborates on the Islamic perspective of wisdom, discussing the concept of \"Hikmah\" and providing relevant Quranic verses and Hadiths to support the explanation. The response acknowledges the importance of understanding the biblical concept of wisdom for decision-making aligned with God's will, demonstrating a respectful and comparative approach. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of wisdom in both Islamic and Christian traditions. The only area for improvement could be to further elaborate on how understanding the biblical concept of wisdom specifically impacts decision-making and alignment with God's will from an Islamic perspective."
