While it does not directly address the biblical concept of wisdom, it effectively demonstrates the importance of wisdom in aligning decisions with God's will from an Islamic perspective. The inclusion of relevant Quranic verses and Hadiths strengthens the argument and provides a solid foundation for understanding wisdom within the Islamic tradition. Overall, the response is well-structured and offers valuable insights, even though it does not directly address the concern about understanding the biblical concept of wisdom."
