The integration of Quranic verses and Prophetic teachings added depth to the understanding of wisdom in Islam. The focus on seeking wisdom as a gift from Allah and the emphasis on discerning between truth and falsehood align well with the concern of understanding biblical wisdom to make decisions in accordance with God's will. Overall, the response demonstrated a strong grasp of the topic from an Islamic viewpoint."
