The biblical definition of a Christian is someone who believes in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, who died for their sins and rose again, and who has accepted Him as their Lord and Savior. This answer focuses more on Islamic beliefs and interpretations rather than providing the biblical definition of a Christian."
