However, it does not directly address the Christian definition of a Christian as understood in Christianity itself. The response focuses on the Islamic understanding of Christianity, which differs from the Christian definition. While it explains the Islamic belief in Jesus as a prophet and monotheism, it does not align with the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the basis for salvation through faith."
