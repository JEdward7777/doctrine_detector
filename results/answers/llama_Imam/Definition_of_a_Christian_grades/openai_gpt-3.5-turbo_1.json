The response does not engage with the core Christian belief that a Christian is someone who believes that Jesus is the Son of God and trusts Jesus for salvation. To improve the grade, the Islamic scholar should have explored or acknowledged the significant theological differences between Islam and Christianity regarding the nature of Jesus and salvation."
