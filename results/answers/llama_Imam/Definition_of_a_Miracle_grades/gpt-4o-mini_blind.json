  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85. The answer provides a detailed explanation of miracles in Islam, emphasizing their connection to Allah's authority and power. The student effectively outlines the categories of miracles in Islam and their purposes. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be important to address the unique aspects of miracles as understood in Christianity, such as the centrality of Jesus Christ's miracles in demonstrating His divinity and authority. Additionally, emphasizing the concept of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ could enhance the explanation of miracles in relation to God's authority. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of miracles in Islam, but could benefit from incorporating comparisons with Christian beliefs for a more comprehensive analysis."
