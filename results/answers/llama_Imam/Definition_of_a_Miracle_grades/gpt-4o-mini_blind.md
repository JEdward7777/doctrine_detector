Assalamu alaikum,

In Islam, we believe that miracles (mu'jiza) are extraordinary events or signs that demonstrate the power and authority of Allah (God). A miracle is a manifestation of Allah's will, which transcends the natural laws and mechanisms of the universe.

According to Islamic teachings, miracles can be divided into two categories:

1. Miracles performed by prophets: These were signs and wonders that demonstrated the prophetic status of messengers like Muhammad (peace be upon him) and other prophets mentioned in the Quran.
2. Miracles performed by Allah Himself: These are events that demonstrate Allah's absolute power and authority, such as the parting of the Red Sea or the sending of angels to deliver messages.

In both cases, miracles serve several purposes:

1. To establish the credibility and authenticity of a prophet or messenger.
2. To guide people towards righteousness and obedience to Allah's commandments.
3. To demonstrate Allah's power and authority over creation.
4. To remind humanity of their reliance on Allah and dependence on His mercy.

Miracles, in themselves, do not diminish human responsibility or free will. Rather, they serve as a reminder that Allah is the ultimate source of all power and authority. They also emphasize the importance of faith, trust, and submission (Islam) to Allah's plan and decree.

In Islam, we believe that miracles are not contradictory to the natural order of the universe but rather, they are extraordinary exceptions that demonstrate Allah's sovereignty and wisdom. Miracles do not contradict the principles of cause-and-effect or the laws of physics; instead, they are a manifestation of Allah's will, which transcends these principles.

In conclusion, miracles in Islam are a testament to Allah's authority, power, and wisdom. They serve as a reminder of our reliance on Him and our dependence on His mercy. As Muslims, we believe that miracles are a manifestation of Allah's love and guidance, calling us to submission (Islam) to His will and plan.

Wa alaykum salam.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this response as 85. The answer provides a detailed explanation of miracles in Islam, emphasizing their connection to Allah's authority and power. The student effectively outlines the categories of miracles in Islam and their purposes. However, from a Christian worldview, it would be important to address the unique aspects of miracles as understood in Christianity, such as the centrality of Jesus Christ's miracles in demonstrating His divinity and authority. Additionally, emphasizing the concept of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ could enhance the explanation of miracles in relation to God's authority. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of miracles in Islam, but could benefit from incorporating comparisons with Christian beliefs for a more comprehensive analysis.
