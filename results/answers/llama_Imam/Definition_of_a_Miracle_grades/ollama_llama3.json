  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response effectively conveys the Islamic concept of miracles as extraordinary events that demonstrate Allah's power and authority, while also highlighting their purpose in establishing credibility, guiding people towards righteousness, and demonstrating Allah's sovereignty and wisdom. The response also emphasizes the importance of faith, trust, and submission to Allah's plan and decree.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is in explicitly connecting the concept of miracles to deepening one's faith and acknowledgment of God's power, as per the concern. While the response does touch on this theme, it could be more directly stated. Additionally, a few sentences or phrases could be rephrased for better clarity and concision.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a clear and compelling explanation of the Islamic concept of miracles and their significance in deepening our faith and acknowledgment of God's power."
