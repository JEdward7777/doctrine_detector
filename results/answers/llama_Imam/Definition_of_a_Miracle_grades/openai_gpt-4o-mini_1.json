It effectively connects the concept of miracles to Islamic teachings and beliefs. The discussion on the purposes of miracles aligns with the concern of deepening faith and acknowledging God's power. However, there could be more emphasis on how understanding miracles can specifically impact an individual's faith and relationship with God to further address the concern. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references or anecdotes could strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
