However, the student did not accurately address the concern of understanding the covenant relationship God established with Israel. The answer lacked a clear focus on the covenant aspect of the relationship between God and the Israelites. The response also included some theological differences between Christianity and Islam, which deviated from the Christian worldview in evaluating the Old Testament concept of the \"people of God.\""
