## [Answer](../Definition_of_the_People_of_God.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As-Salamu Alaykum (peace be upon you). In the Old Testament, the term "people of God" (Hebrew: בְּנֵי יְהוִה, Bnei Yehovah) refers to those who have a covenant relationship with Allah (God) and are considered His chosen people. This term is often used interchangeably with "Israelites" or "Children of Israel".

In the Old Testament, being one of the "people of God" meant:

1. Belonging to the line of Abraham: The patriarch Abraham was promised by God that he would be the father of a great nation (Genesis 12:3). This promise was fulfilled in the descendants of Isaac and Jacob, who became the Israelites.
2. Covenanted with God: The people of God entered into a covenant with Allah, committing to obey His commandments and follow His guidance (Exodus 19-24).
3. Possessing the Torah: The people of God were entrusted with the written Word of God, which contained His laws, instructions, and wisdom (Deuteronomy 8:3).
4. Being set apart: As the chosen people of God, they were distinguished from other nations and cultures by their unique relationship with Allah.
5. Experiencing divine protection: The people of God enjoyed God's favor, protection, and guidance in times of peace and war (Numbers 10:35).

In Islamic understanding, this concept is reflected in the notion of "Ummah" (nation or community), which refers to those who have submitted to Allah's will. While the Old Testament specifically refers to the Israelites as the people of God, the broader concept of a chosen people is shared between Islam and Judaism.
