It correctly highlighted the significance of the nation of Israel being chosen by God and set apart to serve and obey Him. The explanation effectively addressed the concern about understanding the covenant relationship God established with Israel. However, the response could have emphasized more specifically on the covenant aspect and the implications of this relationship in terms of faithfulness and obedience."
