The incorporation of Islamic understanding through the concept of \"Ummah\" further enriched the discussion. However, while the response addresses the concern of the covenant relationship with Israel, it could have delved deeper into the specific terms and conditions of the covenant, such as the Ten Commandments and the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. A more focused exploration of these aspects would have enhanced the evaluation."
