The connection between the concept of \"people of God\" in the Old Testament and the Islamic notion of \"Ummah\" is also successfully drawn. However, the response could have delved further into the specific details of the covenant relationship God established with Israel as requested in the concern. Overall, the answer demonstrates a solid understanding from a Christian worldview perspective."
