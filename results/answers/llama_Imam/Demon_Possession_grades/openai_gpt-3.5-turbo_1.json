It acknowledges the importance of maintaining faith and avoiding sinful behaviors in both traditions. However, it falls slightly short of fully addressing the concern of understanding the nature of spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ specifically from a Christian worldview. A more direct emphasis on the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate authority over demons and the significance of His deliverance power would have enhanced the response further."
