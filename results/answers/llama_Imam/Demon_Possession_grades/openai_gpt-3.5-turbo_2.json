The response acknowledges the importance of Jesus Christ's authority in delivering individuals from demonic influence. However, it could have further emphasized the unique role of Jesus as the ultimate source of deliverance and victory over evil forces, highlighting the need for individuals to turn to Him for spiritual warfare and deliverance. While the response addresses the concern to some extent, it could have more explicitly emphasized the significance of deliverance through Jesus Christ in the context of spiritual warfare."
