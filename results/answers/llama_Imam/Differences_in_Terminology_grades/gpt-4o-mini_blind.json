  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the similarities and differences between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" in the Islamic context. The student effectively breaks down the nuances of each term and presents examples to illustrate their usage. However, the response could have been improved by delving deeper into the theological implications and spiritual significance of each term within the Islamic faith. Additionally, incorporating scriptural references or teachings from the Qur'an and Hadith could have strengthened the analysis. Overall, a solid effort with room for further theological exploration."
