  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response shows a good understanding of the concepts and nuances of 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' within an Islamic context. However, the answer provided does not directly address the appropriate use of these terms according to a Christian worldview or scripture. To improve the grade, the student should focus on incorporating insights or references from the Bible to support their explanation of the terms."
