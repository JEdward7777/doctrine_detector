  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and detailed explanation of the three terms, highlighting their subtle differences in connotation and implication. It also provides practical examples to illustrate each term's meaning, making it easy for readers to understand and apply the concepts.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response does not explicitly address the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. While the response mentions Islamic tradition and references Allah, it could have delved deeper into specific scriptural passages or principles that guide the use of these terms in a Christian context.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written, informative, and provides valuable insights into the meanings of \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish.\" It just falls short of fully addressing the concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture."
