  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the terms \"exhort\", \"encourage\", and \"admonish\" within an Islamic context, emphasizing the nuances in their meanings and applications. The incorporation of Islamic terminology and examples effectively demonstrates how these concepts are understood and practiced within the faith. The response also concludes with a prayerful reflection on using these terms in a manner that aligns with Islamic teachings. The only area for improvement would be to further connect the appropriate use of these forms of encouragement directly to Quranic or Hadith references to strengthen the scriptural basis for their distinctions."
