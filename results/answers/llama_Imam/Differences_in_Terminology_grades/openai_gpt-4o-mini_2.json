  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of the terms \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" within the Islamic tradition, highlighting their nuances and implications. The response effectively tied these concepts to guiding others on the path of righteousness. However, there could have been more direct scriptural references to support and clarify the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to Islamic scripture. Overall, the response demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective."
