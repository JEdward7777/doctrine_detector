Assalamu alaikum (peace be upon you).

The choice of the twelve apostles as Jesus' closest disciples is not explicitly stated in the Quran, since it is a biblical narrative. However, from a Islamic perspective, we can draw some insights from the Bible and Hadiths (prophetic traditions) to understand the significance of this selection.

In the Bible, Matthew 10:2-4 describes the Twelve Apostles as being chosen by Jesus to be his special messengers or "sent ones." This selection was a deliberate act of God's will, emphasizing the importance of these individuals in spreading Jesus' message and establishing His Church.

From an Islamic perspective, the Twelve Apostles can be seen as a group of righteous individuals who were entrusted with the responsibility of sharing the teachings and guidance of Jesus. In this context, their selection by Jesus reflects Allah's (God's) wisdom in choosing people who would be able to carry out this noble task.

The Quran describes the apostles as being chosen for a specific purpose:

"And behold! We gave preference to some of the Apostles above others; among them were some unto whom Allah spoke (directly), and some He raised by rank." (Quran 2:253)

This verse suggests that the selection of the Twelve Apostles was not arbitrary, but rather based on a divine plan. Jesus, as a prophet, had been entrusted with the responsibility of guiding humanity towards righteousness. The choice of his closest disciples reflects Allah's wisdom in selecting individuals who would be able to carry out this mission.

In summary, while we do not have explicit Quranic verses detailing the selection process, we can understand the significance of the Twelve Apostles being chosen by Jesus as a reflection of Allah's wisdom and plan. Their role was crucial in spreading Jesus' message and establishing His Church, which has had far-reaching implications for human history.

May Allah bless our understanding of this topic.
