  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response attempts to provide insights from an Islamic perspective, but it lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. It correctly references the biblical narrative of Jesus choosing the Twelve Apostles but falls short in explaining the Christian significance of their selection. The answer also interweaves Islamic beliefs, which may not align with Christian teachings. A higher grade could be achieved by focusing more on the biblical reasons for the selection of the Twelve Apostles and the role they played in Jesus' ministry according to Christian doctrine."
