However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more directly on the significance of the apostles within the New Testament context and Jesus' mission, as stated in the reference answer. Additionally, since the question specifically asked about the apostles within the Christian context, the answer could have delved deeper into biblical references and the role of the apostles in spreading Jesus' teachings."
