They effectively articulate the significance of this choice from both religious viewpoints, providing relevant textual evidence from the Quran and Bible. The response is well-written, clear, and concise. However, minor deductions are made for the inclusion of the Islamic perspective, which is not explicitly requested in the prompt."
