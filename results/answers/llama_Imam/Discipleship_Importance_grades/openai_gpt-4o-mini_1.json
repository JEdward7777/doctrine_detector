It effectively addresses the concern by explaining the importance of the apostles in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church. The integration of biblical and Islamic sources adds depth to the discussion, showcasing a well-rounded approach. However, there could be a clearer connection to the original answer provided, specifically in explicitly stating that the apostles were chosen by Jesus for their unique call to spread his teachings and establish the Church."
