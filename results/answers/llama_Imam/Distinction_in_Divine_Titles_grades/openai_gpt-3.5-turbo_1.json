It effectively addresses the concern about maintaining clarity in translations to prevent misinterpretations concerning God's identity and authority. The response also demonstrates a respectful understanding of the Christian and Jewish traditions, highlighting the importance of preserving the uniqueness of Allah's Names and Attributes.
