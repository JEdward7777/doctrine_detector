  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response provides information from an Islamic perspective, it does not directly address the question regarding major events in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign. It focuses more on Islamic beliefs and viewpoints regarding Jerusalem and the Second Temple's destruction by the Romans. The grade reflects the lack of engagement with the specific historical event related to Israel after King Solomon's reign in the Islamic tradition. Going forward, it would be beneficial to directly address the question with relevant historical information from an Islamic worldview."
