Assalamu alaikum,

In the Islamic tradition, we do not accept the concept of "Israel" as a separate nation or people, nor do we recognize the sovereignty of any state over Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem is considered a sacred site in Islam, and its control has been a matter of controversy throughout history.

From an Islamic perspective, the major event that occurred after King Solomon's reign was the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE. This event marked the end of the Jewish Temple period and the beginning of a new era in Jewish history.

In Islam, we believe that the Jews were punished for their disobedience to Allah (God) and their rejection of prophets sent to guide them, including Jesus (Isa), peace be upon him. The destruction of the Second Temple was seen as a consequence of these actions.

It's worth noting that Muslims consider Jerusalem a sacred site because it is the city where Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was transported during his Night Journey (Mi'raj) in 621 CE. During this journey, he visited the Farthest Mosque (Al-Aqsa), which is considered by many to be the third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina.

I hope this answers your question while also providing some context from an Islamic perspective. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

Grade: 50

Comment: While the response provides information from an Islamic perspective, it does not directly address the question regarding major events in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign. It focuses more on Islamic beliefs and viewpoints regarding Jerusalem and the Second Temple's destruction by the Romans. The grade reflects the lack of engagement with the specific historical event related to Israel after King Solomon's reign in the Islamic tradition. Going forward, it would be beneficial to directly address the question with relevant historical information from an Islamic worldview.
