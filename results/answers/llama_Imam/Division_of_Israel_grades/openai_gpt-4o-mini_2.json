Instead, it diverges into Islamic perspectives on Jerusalem, the Second Temple's destruction, and Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey. While the additional information is informative, it does not align with the specified concern. The response could have better addressed the issue at hand by providing insights specifically related to the division of the Israelites into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah."
