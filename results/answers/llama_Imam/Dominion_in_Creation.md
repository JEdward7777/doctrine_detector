As a Muslim, I must clarify that the Bible is not considered authoritative scripture by Muslims. However, I can provide an overview of what the Bible teaches on this topic.

According to Genesis 1:28, God commands humans to "have dominion" (Hebrew: radah) over the earth and all its creatures. This phrase has been interpreted in various ways throughout history. Some have understood it as a mandate for human exploitation and domination of nature, while others have seen it as a call to responsible stewardship and care for the environment.

In Genesis 2:15, God places Adam in the Garden of Eden with the instruction to "work" (Hebrew: 'avodah) and take care of it. This has been interpreted by some as a mandate for humans to cultivate and develop the earth's resources, while others have seen it as a call to live in harmony with nature.

In Psalm 8:6-8, humans are described as "little lower than angels" and given dominion over all creation. This passage is often interpreted as highlighting humanity's unique role in God's creation and their responsibility to care for the earth and its creatures.

The New Testament also addresses this topic. In Luke 12:15, Jesus warns against coveting wealth and possessions at the expense of one's relationships with others and with nature. In Matthew 6:25-34, Jesus teaches that humans should not worry about material things like food, clothing, or shelter, but instead trust in God's provision.

In summary, while the Bible does teach that humanity has a role in having dominion over the earth, it also emphasizes the importance of responsible stewardship and care for the environment. It cautions against exploitation and warns against coveting wealth and possessions at the expense of one's relationships with others and with nature.
