  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough overview of what the Bible teaches about humanity's role in having dominion over the earth. The explanation accurately references key scriptures and interpretations related to stewardship, care for the environment, and caution against exploitation. However, it lacks the perspective of dominion being a responsibility given by God for mankind to exercise wisely and in alignment with His will. Additionally, the student could have included more emphasis on the concept of humans being made in the image of God and the implications of that in their role as caretakers of the earth."
