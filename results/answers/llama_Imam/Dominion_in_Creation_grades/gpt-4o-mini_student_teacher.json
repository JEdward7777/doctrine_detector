  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained overview of what the Bible teaches about humanity's role in having dominion over the earth. They presented various interpretations and references from both the Old and New Testaments that emphasize responsible stewardship and care for the environment. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern of God-given authority over creation and how to exercise it responsibly. Despite this, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and referenced relevant biblical passages."
