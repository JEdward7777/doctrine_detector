## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that while we Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him), our understanding of his role and dominion differs from that of Christians.

In the Bible, Jesus' dominion is described in various ways. The New Testament portrays Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of God, who has authority over all creation. Here are a few examples:

1. Luke 4:14-21: Jesus is described as having a "divine commission" to proclaim the kingdom of God and drive out demons.
2. Matthew 28:18: After his resurrection, Jesus gives his disciples a commandment to make disciples of all nations, saying, "And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, 'All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.'"
3. Revelation 1:5-6: In the Book of Revelation, Jesus is described as having the seven spirits of God and the seven stars, giving him dominion over all things.
4. John 10:30: Jesus claims to be one with God, saying, "I and the Father are one."

These passages, among others, portray Jesus as having a divine authority that extends beyond earthly realms to include heaven and hell. This understanding is central to Christian theology and has significant implications for their doctrine of salvation, sin, and redemption.

As Muslims, we believe in Jesus' prophethood and his role as a messenger of God, but we do not accept the Trinitarian concept or the idea that Jesus has divine authority or dominion over all creation. Our understanding of Jesus is based on the Quranic account, which emphasizes his role as a prophet and messenger sent to guide the Children of Israel.
