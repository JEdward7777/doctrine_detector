While the passage mentions Jesus' authority over all creation, it does not explore how this impacts our faith or daily life. Additionally, the response only scratches the surface of Christian theology and does not engage with the biblical concept of Jesus as prophet, priest, and king. The response also takes a neutral stance on the issue by acknowledging different understandings of Jesus' role between Muslims and Christians, but it could have gone further in exploring the implications of Christ's authority for our faith."
