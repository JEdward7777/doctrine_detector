The response mainly focused on describing Jesus' role as prophet, priest, and king without delving into the implications of his authority on faith and life. In a Christian worldview, acknowledging Jesus' dominion over all aspects of life is fundamental to faith and practice. The response could have been strengthened by exploring how recognizing Christ's authority influences beliefs, decisions, and actions in the daily life of a Christian."
