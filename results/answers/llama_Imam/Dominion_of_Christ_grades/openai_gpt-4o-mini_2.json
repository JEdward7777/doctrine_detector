However, it fails to delve deeper into how recognizing the authority of Christ in all aspects of life impacts our faith from a Christian worldview. There is a missed opportunity to discuss the implications of Christ's authority on our relationship with God, salvation, and the way we are called to live as Christians. A more robust exploration of these theological implications would have strengthened the response significantly."
