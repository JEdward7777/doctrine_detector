## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
My brother, this is an interesting question. As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that our primary sources of guidance are the Quran and Hadith (Prophetic traditions). However, since you're asking about the Bible, I'll provide some insight.

In Christian eschatology, "the last days" refer to the period between the birth of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) and the Second Coming. The duration is not explicitly stated in the Bible, but there are various interpretations among Christian scholars and theologians.

Some Christians believe that the last days began with Jesus' ascension into heaven or at the time of the early Church Fathers. Others propose that the last days started with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, as a fulfillment of biblical prophecies (e.g., Ezekiel 37:16-17).

Some notable Christian scholars have offered estimates:

* The Catholic Church teaches that the last days will last around 2,000 years.
* Some Protestant theologians propose a longer duration, spanning thousands or even tens of thousands of years.

However, it's essential to note that these interpretations are not universally accepted among Christians. Some may view the concept of "the last days" as ambiguous or open-ended, allowing for varying understandings and interpretations.

As Muslims, we believe in the prophetic tradition of Muhammad (peace be upon him), who received revelations from Allah through the angel Gabriel. Our understanding of the end times is based on Quranic verses and Hadith narratives. We do not rely on Christian scripture, as our faith is distinct and separate.

I hope this provides some insight into the concept of "the last days" in a Christian context. If you have further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask!
