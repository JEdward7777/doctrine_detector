However, there are some theological inaccuracies, such as referring to Jesus as \"peace be upon him\" (a Muslim phrase) and attributing teachings to the Catholic Church that are not doctrinally supported. Additionally, the answer could have emphasized more clearly the biblical teachings regarding the unknown duration of the last days, and the distinct differences between Christian and Islamic eschatological beliefs. Further engagement with biblical texts and a clearer delineation of doctrinal distinctions could have strengthened the response."
