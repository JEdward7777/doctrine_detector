  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed overview of Christian eschatology and interpretations regarding the duration of \"the last days.\" While the student demonstrated knowledge and understanding of the topic, they did not directly address the concern raised about how uncertainty regarding the duration of the last days can affect how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. The response would have been stronger if it had explicitly connected the uncertainty to its potential impact on Christian living and faith."
