However, it does not directly address the concern raised about how this uncertainty can impact how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. It could have further elaborated on how differing views on the duration of the last days might influence the urgency or preparedness with which Christians approach their faith in light of Christ's promised return."
