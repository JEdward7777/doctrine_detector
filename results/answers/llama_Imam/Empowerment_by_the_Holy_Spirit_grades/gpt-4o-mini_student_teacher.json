The student focused more on similarities between Islamic teachings and Christian beliefs rather than addressing the specific ways the Holy Spirit empowers Christians according to Biblical references. Additionally, the stance on not endorsing the Christian doctrine of the Trinity or the Holy Spirit could be seen as a limitation in fully grasping the Christian perspective on the Holy Spirit's empowerment."
