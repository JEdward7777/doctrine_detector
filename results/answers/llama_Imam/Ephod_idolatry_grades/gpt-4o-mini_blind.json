  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provided contains some inaccuracies as Gideon and the creation of the golden ephod is not found in the Quran but rather in the Old Testament in the book of Judges. The response also blends Islamic beliefs with the Christian narrative, which could lead to confusion. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of intentions in worship, but the lack of accuracy in the biblical reference and the mixing of religious teachings contribute to the lower grade."
