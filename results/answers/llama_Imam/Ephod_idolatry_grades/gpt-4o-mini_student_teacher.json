However, the response misses the key point that objects associated with worship, such as the golden ephod, can become idols if not kept in proper perspective, leading people away from true worship of God. The inclusion of Quranic verses and reflections relevant to the Islamic faith is appreciated, but the main lesson from a Christian perspective regarding the dangers of idolatry and material distractions was not directly addressed. Encouraging the student to focus more on the Christian worldview implications of the story would improve the response."
