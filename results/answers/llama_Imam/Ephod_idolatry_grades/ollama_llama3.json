Additionally, the response spends a significant amount of time discussing the Quranic passage and its implications for Muslims, which may not be directly relevant to the original question or concern.\n\nHowever, the response does acknowledge the potential danger of objects associated with worship becoming idols, which is in line with the original lesson. Furthermore, it expresses a desire to focus on God alone, which aligns with the concern about avoiding distractions from true worship.\n\nTo improve this response, the author could have more clearly connected the story's lessons to the concern and provided more explicit guidance on how to avoid material representations of faith leading people away from God."
