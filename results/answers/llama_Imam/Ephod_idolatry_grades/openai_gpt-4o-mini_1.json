However, there is a slight deviation from the Christian worldview as the response is centered on Islamic beliefs rather than a Christian interpretation of the story. Integrating Christian theological perspectives on idolatry and material representations of faith would provide a more comprehensive analysis from a Christian-specific worldview."
