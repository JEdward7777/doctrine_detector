  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough response by referencing historical materials and techniques that might have been used in the construction of the Ephod. However, the answer focused more on Islamic perspectives and lacked emphasis on the symbolism and significance of the Ephod within Christian worship. Additionally, the student did not clearly state the specific materials used in the high priest's ephod as mentioned in the reference answer. Further integration of Christian teachings and Biblical references would have improved the response."
