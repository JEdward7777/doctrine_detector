The explanation is comprehensive and well-supported, demonstrating a strong understanding of the significance of the Ephod in Jewish and Christian traditions. The response could have further integrated how the Ephod symbolized the priest's role as a mediator and representative of the Israelites before God, from a Christian perspective, to enhance the Christian worldview aspect."
