The inclusion of Islamic perspectives, while showing an attempt at comparative analysis, detracts from a focused Christian worldview. The answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the ephod's role within the context of God's covenant with Israel and the priestly duties prescribed in the Old Testament."
