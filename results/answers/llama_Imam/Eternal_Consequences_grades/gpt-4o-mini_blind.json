However, as the question specifically mentioned eternal consequences for those who are \"perishing,\" the answer should have focused more on the eternal aspect of the punishment and the theological implications from a Christian worldview. Additionally, since the question pertained to a Christian worldview, the response should have centered on biblical teachings rather than Quranic references. More emphasis on the eternal separation from God and the need for salvation through Jesus Christ would have aligned better with the question's context from a Christian perspective."
