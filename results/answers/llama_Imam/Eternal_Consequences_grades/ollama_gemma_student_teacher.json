  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer accurately summarizes the Quranic understanding of the eternal consequences for those who are described as \"perishing.\" The response clearly explains that those who reject Allah and His Messenger will suffer an eternal punishment characterized by severe torment, removal from Allah's mercy, and lack of intercession. The student's understanding of the Quranic text is commendable and demonstrates a thorough knowledge of the Islamic beliefs about the afterlife."
