## [Answer](../Eternal_Consequences.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
In the Quran, the term "perishing" (fāsha) refers to those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, and therefore suffer an eternal punishment. The Quran describes the fate of these individuals in several verses.

Firstly, they will be punished with severe torment in the Hereafter. As Allah says:

"And whoever turns away from the remembrance of Allah except for him who wavers in his way, while he sees or when he is secure - then verified losers are those who were perishing in ignorance of the Hereafter." (Quran 46:5)

This punishment will be a consequence of their rejection of Allah's guidance and their failure to acknowledge His signs and proofs. The Quran also emphasizes that this punishment will be eternal, saying:

"Then taste the torment; you will have neither protector nor helper against Allah's judgment." (Quran 44:56)

Secondly, those who are described as "perishing" will be removed from the mercy of Allah. As Allah says:

"If only there had been a community among those who were given scripture to warn them! Yet woe to those who associate others with Allah - They will not believe until they see the painful torment." (Quran 3:146)

This removal from Allah's mercy means that these individuals will no longer be able to benefit from His forgiveness and compassion. Instead, they will suffer an eternal punishment.

Thirdly, the Quran emphasizes that those who are described as "perishing" will not have any intercession on their behalf in the Hereafter. As Allah says:

"On the Day when He will call out: 'Who has broken the obligations and ignored His limits? So they will say: 'We were misguided.'" (Quran 6:128)

This lack of intercession means that these individuals will not have any advocate or helper to plead their case before Allah on the Day of Judgment. Instead, they will face the consequences of their own actions.

In summary, those who are described as "perishing" in the Quran will suffer an eternal punishment characterized by severe torment, removal from Allah's mercy, and lack of intercession on their behalf. These individuals will be condemned to a state of eternal regret and sorrow, separated from the blessings and mercy of Allah.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 85.

The response effectively conveys the Quranic concept of "perishing" (fāsha) as those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, resulting in an eternal punishment characterized by severe torment, removal from Allah's mercy, and lack of intercession. The inclusion of relevant Quranic verses supports the explanation and provides evidence for the concept.

The response also highlights the seriousness of eternal separation from God, emphasizing that those who perish will not have any advocate or helper to plead their case before Allah on the Day of Judgment. This is a crucial point that underscores the gravity of rejecting Allah's guidance and ignoring His signs and proofs.

To improve this response, I would suggest providing more context about the nature of eternal punishment in Islam, specifically highlighting how it differs from Christian conceptions of hell. Additionally, exploring the implications of eternal separation from God for human relationships and daily life could further emphasize the seriousness of rejecting Allah's mercy.

Overall, however, the response provides a clear and concise explanation of the Quranic concept of "perishing" and effectively communicates the gravity of eternal separation from God.
