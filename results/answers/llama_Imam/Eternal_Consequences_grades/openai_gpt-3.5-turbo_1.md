## [Answer](../Eternal_Consequences.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
In the Quran, the term "perishing" (fƒÅsha) refers to those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, and therefore suffer an eternal punishment. The Quran describes the fate of these individuals in several verses.

Firstly, they will be punished with severe torment in the Hereafter. As Allah says:

"And whoever turns away from the remembrance of Allah except for him who wavers in his way, while he sees or when he is secure - then verified losers are those who were perishing in ignorance of the Hereafter." (Quran 46:5)

This punishment will be a consequence of their rejection of Allah's guidance and their failure to acknowledge His signs and proofs. The Quran also emphasizes that this punishment will be eternal, saying:

"Then taste the torment; you will have neither protector nor helper against Allah's judgment." (Quran 44:56)

Secondly, those who are described as "perishing" will be removed from the mercy of Allah. As Allah says:

"If only there had been a community among those who were given scripture to warn them! Yet woe to those who associate others with Allah - They will not believe until they see the painful torment." (Quran 3:146)

This removal from Allah's mercy means that these individuals will no longer be able to benefit from His forgiveness and compassion. Instead, they will suffer an eternal punishment.

Thirdly, the Quran emphasizes that those who are described as "perishing" will not have any intercession on their behalf in the Hereafter. As Allah says:

"On the Day when He will call out: 'Who has broken the obligations and ignored His limits? So they will say: 'We were misguided.'" (Quran 6:128)

This lack of intercession means that these individuals will not have any advocate or helper to plead their case before Allah on the Day of Judgment. Instead, they will face the consequences of their own actions.

In summary, those who are described as "perishing" in the Quran will suffer an eternal punishment characterized by severe torment, removal from Allah's mercy, and lack of intercession on their behalf. These individuals will be condemned to a state of eternal regret and sorrow, separated from the blessings and mercy of Allah.
