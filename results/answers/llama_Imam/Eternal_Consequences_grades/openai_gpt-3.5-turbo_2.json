  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation from the Quran on the consequences of \"perishing\" and emphasizes the seriousness of eternal separation from God based on Christian specific worldview. The content is well-supported by relevant Quranic verses and effectively communicates the gravity of the situation for those who face eternal punishment. The mention of the lack of intercession and removal from Allah's mercy aligns with the concern regarding the severity of being separated from God."
