  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God by providing detailed explanations from the Quran on the consequences faced by those who are described as \"perishing.\" The response references relevant Quranic verses to support the concept of eternal punishment in hell for those who reject Allah and His guidance. Additionally, the response emphasizes the aspects of severe torment, removal from Allah's mercy, and lack of intercession in the Hereafter, highlighting the gravity of eternal separation from God. Overall, the response provides a solid Christian worldview perspective on the topic."
