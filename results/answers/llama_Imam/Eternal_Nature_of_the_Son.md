## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must emphasize that the concept of "Son of God" is specific to Christian theology and does not have an equivalent in Islam. However, I can provide some insight into what differentiates Jesus, known as the "Son of God" in Christianity, from human sons regarding existence and eternal nature.

From a Christian perspective:

* The Son of God is considered eternal and co-eternal with God the Father, having existed before the creation of humanity.
* He is seen as the second person of the Trinity, along with God the Father and the Holy Spirit. This means that Jesus is not created by God but rather eternally begotten from the Father's essence.
* The Son of God is considered divine, sharing in the nature and attributes of God (e.g., omniscience, omnipotence). He is seen as the image of God and has a unique relationship with God the Father.

In contrast, human sons are created by God and exist within the bounds of creation. They have a limited lifespan, physical bodies, and finite knowledge. Their existence is not eternal or co-eternal with God's.

As Muslims, we reject the Christian concept of the "Son of God" as an affirmation of Jesus' divinity, which goes against Islamic teachings about Jesus being a mortal prophet and a human creation of Allah (God). In Islam, Jesus is revered as a noble messenger of Allah, but he is not considered divine or eternal.

It's essential to note that the Christian understanding of the "Son of God" is rooted in their scriptures, particularly the New Testament. Muslims, on the other hand, base our beliefs and teachings on the Quran and Hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). The two faiths have distinct conceptions of Jesus' nature and role, which are shaped by their respective scriptures and theological traditions.
