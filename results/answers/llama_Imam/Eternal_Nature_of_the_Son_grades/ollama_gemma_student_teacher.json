  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer adequately addresses the concern of emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God. \n\nThe student correctly points out the difference between the eternal nature of the Son of God and the limited lifespan of human sons. Additionally, the student provides a clear explanation of the Christian belief in the Son of God as the second person of the Trinity and his divine nature. \n\nHowever, the student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on the Son of God's role in the creation of the world, as suggested in the reference answer."
