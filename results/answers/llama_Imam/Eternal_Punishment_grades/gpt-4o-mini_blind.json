  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice from an Islamic perspective. The student effectively covers key points such as accountability, consequences, equality before the law, and the preservation of human free will. However, from a Christian worldview, the grading is lower due to the theological differences between Christianity and Islam on this concept. Additionally, the response could benefit from incorporating more specific references to Islamic texts to further support the points made."
