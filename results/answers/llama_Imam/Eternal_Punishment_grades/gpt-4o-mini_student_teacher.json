However, the answer did not address the specific Christian worldview concerning Jesus' sacrifice as the basis for eternal punishment in hell. In a Christian worldview, justice is demonstrated through the consequences of rejecting Jesus' sacrifice as the way to salvation. The response lacked a clear comparison or contrast with the Christian understanding of divine justice, which is crucial when discussing such theological concepts."
