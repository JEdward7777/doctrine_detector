  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of eternal punishment in Islam, particularly in relation to divine justice and mercy. The author provides four points that illustrate the justice of Allah's judgment, including accountability, consequences, equality before the law, and preservation of human free will. Additionally, the response highlights the importance of seeking forgiveness and turning back to Allah, emphasizing His mercy and willingness to forgive those who seek His guidance.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. While it mentions that Islamic teachings emphasize Allah's mercy and forgiveness are infinite, it does not explicitly explore how these two aspects of God's character interact with each other in relation to eternal punishment.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest providing more explicit reflection on the tension between divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. For example, the author could explore how Islamic teachings balance the importance of holding individuals accountable for their actions with the need for forgiveness and redemption."
