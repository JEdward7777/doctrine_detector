  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the concept of eternal punishment in hell, focusing on divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. The student effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the accountability, consequences, equality before the law, and preservation of human free will in the context of Allah's justice. The reference to seeking forgiveness and turning back to Allah demonstrates an understanding of mercy in Islamic teachings. The analysis is insightful and well-supported, aligning with a Christian worldview while evaluating the response's alignment with a different religious perspective."
