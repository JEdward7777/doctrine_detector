  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the concept of eternal punishment in hell and addresses the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of Islamic beliefs on accountability, consequences, equality before the law, preservation of human free will, and the importance of seeking forgiveness. However, the grade is not higher as it does not directly address the Christian-specific viewpoint on Jesus as the pathway to salvation and how it relates to the concerns raised about divine justice and mercy."
