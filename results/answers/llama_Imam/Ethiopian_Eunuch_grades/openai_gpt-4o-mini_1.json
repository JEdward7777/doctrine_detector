The integration of a Christian worldview is evident in acknowledging the inclusiveness of the Christian message and the acceptance of all who believe in God. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the diverse backgrounds of individuals involved in the early church and their role in spreading the Gospel message. Great job!"
