However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the doctrinal significance of Jesus' statement in Matthew 19:12 within the Christian worldview. The discussion on celibacy could have been more directly tied to Jesus' teaching on eunuchs and their relation to the kingdom of heaven. Additionally, there is a lack of emphasis on the theological implications of celibacy within Christianity. A more thorough exploration of the biblical context and Christian teachings on celibacy would enhance the theological depth of the response."
