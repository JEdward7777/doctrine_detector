  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of Jesus' reference to eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 from an Islamic perspective, which is not directly relevant to the given Christian worldview question. While the student made an effort to draw parallels between the concepts of celibacy and devoted service in Islam, the lack of addressing the biblical perspective on celibacy and the specific reasons for celibacy in Christianity resulted in a lower grade. Additionally, the answer did not fully align with the teacher's reference answer, which focused solely on Jesus' acknowledgment of different types of eunuchs related to celibacy for the kingdom of heaven."
