The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the historical context and cultural nuances of celibacy and the reasons for living a life without marriage. However, there could have been more direct engagement with the biblical perspective on celibacy and a deeper analysis of how Jesus' statement aligns or differs with Islamic teachings on the subject."
