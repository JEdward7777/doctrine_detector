# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As-Salamu Alaykum,

I must clarify that as an Imam, my primary focus is on Islamic teachings, and I will provide an interpretation from a Muslim perspective.

In Matthew 19:12, Jesus refers to eunuchs in the context of discussing divorce and remarriage. He says, "For there are some eunuchs, which were so born of their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, that were made eunuchs of men; and there be eunuchs, which have themselves made eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake."

From an Islamic perspective, Jesus' statement is not directly related to the concept of celibacy in Islam. In fact, Islam does not encourage or promote celibacy as a means of spiritual growth or devotion to Allah (SWT). Muslims are encouraged to get married and have children, as marriage and family are considered essential aspects of human life.

However, I can provide some insights on Jesus' statement regarding eunuchs. From a historical context, the term "eunuch" might refer to individuals who were physically castrated or had undergone surgical procedures that rendered them sterile. In Jesus' time, this practice was not uncommon among certain groups in society, such as slaves or servants.

Jesus' words can be seen as an encouragement for those who are unable or unwilling to marry and have children due to various circumstances (e.g., physical disabilities or spiritual commitments). He might be suggesting that these individuals, despite their physical or biological limitations, can still dedicate themselves to the kingdom of heaven and lead a life of devotion to God.

In Islamic terminology, such individuals would not necessarily be considered "celibates" in the classical sense. Instead, they would be seen as having made a conscious choice to prioritize their spiritual growth and service to Allah (SWT) over worldly pursuits like marriage and family.

In conclusion, while Jesus' statement on eunuchs might have some relevance to modern discussions about celibacy or singleness, it is essential to consider the historical context and cultural nuances surrounding his words. From an Islamic perspective, celibacy or singleness are not encouraged as a means of spiritual growth, but rather marriage and family are considered essential aspects of human life.

May Allah (SWT) guide us on our paths, and may we strive to serve Him with humility and devotion.

Comment: The response provides a thoughtful exploration of Jesus' statement on eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 from an Islamic perspective, drawing parallels and contrasts with the concept of celibacy in Islam. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the historical context and cultural nuances of celibacy and the reasons for living a life without marriage. However, there could have been more direct engagement with the biblical perspective on celibacy and a deeper analysis of how Jesus' statement aligns or differs with Islamic teachings on the subject.
