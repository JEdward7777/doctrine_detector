  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a comprehensive explanation of exalting God in daily life from an Islamic perspective, it deviates from the Christian worldview given the concern provided. The answer emphasizes Islamic beliefs and practices, which may not align perfectly with Christian beliefs. However, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept of exalting God and provides practical examples for its application in daily life. Encouraging the student to also incorporate Christian teachings and practices related to exalting God would improve the alignment with the specified concern."
