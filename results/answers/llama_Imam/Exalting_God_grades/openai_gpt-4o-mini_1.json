It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of exalting God above all else in life. The practical examples and guidance given align well with a Christian-specific worldview of exalting and glorifying the one true God. Great job in connecting the Islamic perspective on exalting God with the Christian understanding of worship and living according to God's will."
