  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the parable of the Good Samaritan and its significance, drawing parallels with Islamic teachings on kindness and compassion. However, the response focused more on the similarities between Christian and Islamic teachings rather than delving deeply into the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables. The student could have further emphasized the relevance of the parable in today's society from a Christian perspective to improve the grade."
