  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer by giving examples from the Bible that illustrate instances of possession or influence by evil spirits, even though it was approached from an Islamic perspective. The student showed an understanding of the concept in Christianity and respectfully shared the Islamic viewpoint. However, there was minimal connection made to the concern regarding the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith."
