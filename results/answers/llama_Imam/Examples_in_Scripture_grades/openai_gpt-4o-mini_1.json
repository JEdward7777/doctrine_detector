The student effectively integrates examples from the Bible to illustrate instances of demon possession, showing an awareness of the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative. The response could further strengthen the connection between these examples and their relevance to contemporary faith, but overall, it demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the topic from a Christian-specific worldview."
