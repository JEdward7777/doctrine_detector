They effectively linked the examples provided in the original answer with the concern regarding the intersection of guilt, justice, and divine judgment. The inclusion of relevant biblical examples alongside explanations from an Islamic perspective demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic and shows respect for both faith traditions. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the ultimate resolution of guilt through divine judgment and forgiveness in both Christian and Islamic contexts."
