  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided by the student offers a thoughtful exploration of guilt in the Bible from an Islamic perspective, demonstrating insight into the theological and moral implications within the context of various biblical narratives. However, while the examples provided align with the concern of understanding guilt in relation to justice and divine judgment, there is limited direct engagement with the specific concern about innocence and divine judgment as highlighted in the answer given. The student's response weaves together Islamic and Christian perspectives, which enriches the discussion but could benefit from a more focused alignment with the provided answer and concern."
