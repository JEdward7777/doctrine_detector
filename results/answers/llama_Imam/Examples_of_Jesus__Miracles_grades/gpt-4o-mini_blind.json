  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments:\nWhile the response provides a detailed explanation of specific miracles attributed to Jesus in the Quran as understood from a Muslim perspective, it lacks a Christian-specific worldview in addressing the significance of these miracles. The response does not mention the miracles recorded in the Gospels, which are foundational to Christian belief. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate the Christian understanding of Jesus' miracles and their significance, offering insights from the New Testament narratives."
