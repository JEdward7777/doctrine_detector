  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained response focusing on specific miracles mentioned in the Quran related to Jesus, which is commendable. However, the concern specifies the significance of Jesus' miracles in supporting the belief in Him as the Son of God, which is not addressed in the response. To improve the grade, the student should have linked the significance of the miracles mentioned to the divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, as per the Christian worldview."
