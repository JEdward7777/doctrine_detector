  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the miracles mentioned in the Quran, including their significance within the Islamic context. The author successfully highlights Jesus' prophetic status and divine connection through these events, which aligns with the concern about recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in believing Him as the Son of God.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:\n\n1. While the response does mention Jesus' prophetic status and divine connection, it doesn't explicitly connect these to Jesus being the Son of God, which is the primary concern.\n2. The response focuses primarily on the Quranic account of Jesus' miracles, which may not directly address the concern about recognizing Jesus as the Son of God.\n\nTo improve the response, I would suggest that the author more explicitly link Jesus' prophetic status and divine connection to His divinity and God's kingdom, using biblical references to support their claims. This could help strengthen the connection between Jesus' miracles and His identity as the Son of God.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic teachings on Jesus and his miracles, but could benefit from further exploration and connection-making to address the primary concern."
