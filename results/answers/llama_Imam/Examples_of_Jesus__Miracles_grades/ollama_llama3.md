## [Answer](../Examples_of_Jesus__Miracles.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must emphasize that the Quranic account of Jesus (peace be upon him) is based on earlier revelations and prophecies, including the Gospel according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. While the Quran does not provide a comprehensive list of miracles performed by Jesus, it mentions several significant events in its description of his life and ministry.

Here are some specific miracles mentioned in the Quran:

1. The Virgin Birth (Maryam 19:16-21): Jesus was born to Mary without a father, a miraculous occurrence that highlights God's power and sovereignty.

Significance: This miracle emphasizes the divine origin of Jesus' prophethood and underlines his role as a prophet of God, sent to guide humanity.

2. Healing the Blind and Mute (Aal 'Imran 3:46): The Quran mentions Jesus' healing of people with physical disabilities, including blindness and muteness.

Significance: This miracle demonstrates Jesus' compassion and his ability to heal people's physical ailments, which was a hallmark of his prophetic mission.

3. Raising the Dead (Al-Qasas 28:2-8): The Quran describes Jesus' raising of the dead, including bringing a youth back to life.

Significance: This miracle underscores Jesus' connection with the spiritual realm and his ability to defy the natural order, which is a characteristic of prophets who are chosen by God.

4. Feeding Thousands (Al-Qasas 28:2-8): The Quran mentions Jesus' miraculous provision of food for thousands of people.

Significance: This miracle highlights Jesus' role as a provider and sustainer, as well as his connection with the divine, which enabled him to perform such a feat.

5. His Word was Made Substantial (Al-Qasas 28:2-8): The Quran describes how Jesus' words had the power to bring into being what did not previously exist.

Significance: This miracle emphasizes Jesus' prophetic authority and his ability to shape reality through his words, which is a characteristic of prophets who are sent by God.

It's essential to note that the Quran does not provide a comprehensive list of miracles performed by Jesus. Instead, it highlights specific events that demonstrate his prophetic status and divine connection. As a Muslim, I must emphasize that we believe in Jesus as one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah (God), but we do not subscribe to the idea of divinity or deification of any human being, including Jesus.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a good overview of the miracles mentioned in the Quran, including their significance within the Islamic context. The author successfully highlights Jesus' prophetic status and divine connection through these events, which aligns with the concern about recognizing the significance of Jesus' miracles in believing Him as the Son of God.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:

1. While the response does mention Jesus' prophetic status and divine connection, it doesn't explicitly connect these to Jesus being the Son of God, which is the primary concern.
2. The response focuses primarily on the Quranic account of Jesus' miracles, which may not directly address the concern about recognizing Jesus as the Son of God.

To improve the response, I would suggest that the author more explicitly link Jesus' prophetic status and divine connection to His divinity and God's kingdom, using biblical references to support their claims. This could help strengthen the connection between Jesus' miracles and His identity as the Son of God.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic teachings on Jesus and his miracles, but could benefit from further exploration and connection-making to address the primary concern.
