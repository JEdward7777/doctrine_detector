However, the concern raised about recognizing Jesus' miracles as signs of His divinity and God's kingdom is not addressed, as the Islamic perspective does not attribute divinity to Jesus. The response effectively highlights the Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus, but does not align with the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God."
