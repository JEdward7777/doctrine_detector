  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the concept of faith in the context of trusting Allah's promises, drawing parallels with the story of Prophet Ibrahim. It elaborates on the importance of faith as not just intellectual assent but as active surrender and reliance on Allah. The explanation of tawakkul (reliance) and the link between faith and God's promises is well-developed and aligns with the given concern. Overall, the response provides a thorough and insightful exploration of the topic, rooted in a Christian specific worldview."
