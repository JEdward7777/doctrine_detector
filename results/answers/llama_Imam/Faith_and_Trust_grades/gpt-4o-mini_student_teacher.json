The response focused more on Islamic teachings and perspectives rather than providing an in-depth exploration of the Christian perspective. Additionally, the answer did not directly relate trust and faith in the context of Christian belief as requested. Further explanation and analysis from a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
