  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the difference in beliefs between Christianity and Islam regarding Jesus Christ.

However, the response solely focuses on theological differences and does not fully explore the core of the Gospel message or its personal implications for believers, leading to a deduction in the grade."
