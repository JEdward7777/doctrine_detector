## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, my brother. The concept of "believing in Jesus" is an important one, especially given the rich history and theological nuances surrounding this figure in Islam. In Islamic scripture and tradition, Jesus (Isa) is considered a revered prophet sent by Allah to guide humanity.

To believe in Jesus means to acknowledge his prophethood, recognize his miracles as divine signs of his mission, and affirm his message of monotheism and submission to the One God, Allah. As the Quran describes:

"And [remember] when Allah said to the angels, 'I am creating a human being from clay.'" (Quran 38:71)

"Then He proportioned him aright and blew into him from His Spirit." (Quran 38:72)

In this context, believing in Jesus entails accepting his prophetic role as a messenger of Allah's wisdom, compassion, and justice. This includes recognizing the miraculous events recorded in the Quran, such as Jesus' conception without a father, his speaking while still an infant, and his performing miracles with Allah's permission.

Moreover, believing in Jesus means affirming the core message he brought: the unity of God, the oneness of humanity, and the importance of living a righteous life. This is reflected in Quranic verses like:

"O people of the Book! Do not exaggerate in your faith nor say about Allah anything but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah." (Quran 4:171)

In Islamic understanding, Jesus' prophethood and message are integral to his role as a messenger of Allah, and believing in him is an affirmation of these aspects.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this concept or address related questions?
