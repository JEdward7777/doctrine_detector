  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of belief in Jesus from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing his prophethood and message. However, the student did not address the concern provided, which focused on understanding the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life. The answer lacks a Christian-specific perspective on Jesus as the Son of God, the significance of his sacrifice for sins, and living a life honoring him. The response should have integrated these key Christian beliefs to fully address the question."
