  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response diverges significantly from the Christian-specific understanding of believing in Jesus. The response provided does not align with the Christian worldview that Jesus is the Son of God and that belief in Him involves trust in His sacrificial death for the forgiveness of sins. Therefore, the grade is low as the response lacks accuracy and alignment with the specified concern from a Christian perspective."
