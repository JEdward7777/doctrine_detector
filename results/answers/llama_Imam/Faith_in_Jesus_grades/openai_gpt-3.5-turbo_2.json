However, it did not directly address the concern raised regarding the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life from a Christian worldview. The response focused more on theological aspects rather than practical implications for one's personal life. It would have been beneficial to connect the belief in Jesus as the Son of God and recognizing his sacrifice for sins to how it should impact one's daily living and decision-making."
