However, it does not directly address the concern about understanding the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life from a Christian perspective. It would have been beneficial to tie in how trusting Jesus as the Son of God, recognizing his sacrifice for sins, and living in a way that honors him can transform one's personal life and relationship with God according to Christian beliefs."
