However, from a Christian worldview, there are doctrinal differences regarding the nature of Jesus as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity, which were not addressed in the response. The focus on Islamic beliefs and practices regarding Jesus, while informative, does not align with a Christian understanding of true faith in Jesus being centered on Him as the divine Son of God and personal Savior. Additional focus on the uniqueness of Jesus in Christianity would have strengthened the response."
