However, the concern raised about recognizing evidence of genuine faith in daily life is not directly addressed in the response. The emphasis on the guiding role of the Holy Spirit in producing good spiritual fruits mentioned in the original answer could have been incorporated with appropriate references to the Islamic understanding of faith manifesting in one's daily life. Further integration of how the Holy Spirit's presence can be reflected in the believer's character and actions would have enhanced the response."
