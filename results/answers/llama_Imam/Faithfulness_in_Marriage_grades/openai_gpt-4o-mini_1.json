The inclusion of relevant Bible passages and explaining the significance of fidelity in marital relationships from a Christian perspective is thorough and well-done. The response also shows respect for both faith traditions by acknowledging similarities in the importance of maintaining the sanctity of the marital bond. Great job in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview while embracing cross-faith understanding."
