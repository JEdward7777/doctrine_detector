The student effectively articulates how favoritism can lead to social bonds being damaged, injustice, distortion of Muslim values, and impact on personal relationships. The references to Islamic principles and Quranic verses add depth to the response. However, the answer could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or practical steps on how to avoid favoritism in relationships. Additionally, more emphasis on the importance of repentance and seeking forgiveness for instances where favoritism may have occurred would further enhance the response."
