While the response is rooted in Islamic teachings, the principles discussed align closely with Christian values of avoiding favoritism and treating all individuals with love and fairness. The emphasis on justice, equality, and compassion resonates with Christian teachings on loving one's neighbor and treating others as we would want to be treated. However, a deeper exploration of specific Christian scriptures or teachings related to favoritism would have further strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
