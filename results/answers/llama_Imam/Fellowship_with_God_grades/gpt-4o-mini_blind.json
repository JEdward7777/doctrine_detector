They displayed respect and understanding towards both faiths while highlighting the distinct differences in theological beliefs. The response effectively explained the significance of fellowship with God in Christianity, emphasizing key practices like prayer, Bible reading, and worship. However, there were instances where the explanation could have been more detailed and precise, especially regarding the theological underpinnings of fellowship with God in Christianity. Additionally, the response could have further delved into the doctrinal aspects of this concept within a Christian worldview. Overall, a good effort was made to address the question from a comparative perspective."
