## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum, my dear brother or sister. Finding "grace in the eyes of God" is a beautiful phrase that originates from the Arabic term "barakah." In Islamic theology, barakah refers to the divine favor, mercy, and blessing that one receives from Allah (God).

To find grace in the eyes of God means that a person has earned His pleasure and approval. It implies that one's actions, words, and intentions are pleasing to Allah, resulting in His mercy, guidance, and protection.

In the Quran, we read: "And whoever fears Allah â€“ He will create a way out for him and provide from Him what He does not know" (Quran 65:2-3). This verse suggests that those who fear and obey Allah will find a path to success and provision in their lives.

Finding grace in the eyes of God also means being under His mercy, which encompasses forgiveness, protection, and guidance. When we are in a state of barakah, we can expect Allah's blessings to flow into our lives, including spiritual growth, physical well-being, and material provision.

In everyday life, finding grace in the eyes of God might manifest as:

1. A sense of peace and tranquility despite challenges.
2. Guidance and wisdom for making decisions.
3. Protection from harm or evil.
4. Increased faith and trust in Allah's plan.
5. Improved relationships with others, based on love and compassion.

To cultivate this blessed state, one must strive to maintain a strong connection with Allah through:

1. Regular prayer and remembrance of Him (dhikr).
2. Adhering to His commands and prohibitions.
3. Purifying the heart from envy, pride, and other negative qualities.
4. Developing self-reflection, gratitude, and humility.

May we all seek to find grace in the eyes of God, my dear brother or sister. May our lives be filled with His mercy, guidance, and blessing. Amen.
