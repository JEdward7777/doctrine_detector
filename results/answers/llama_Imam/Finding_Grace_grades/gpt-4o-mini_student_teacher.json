  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful explanation of finding grace in the eyes of God from an Islamic perspective. They effectively explored the concept of divine favor, mercy, and blessings from Allah. However, the response did not directly address the concern of seeking and recognizing God's favor in one's life but instead focused more on the general understanding of grace in Islam. Therefore, while the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic, the response could have been more aligned with the specified concern to receive a higher grade."
