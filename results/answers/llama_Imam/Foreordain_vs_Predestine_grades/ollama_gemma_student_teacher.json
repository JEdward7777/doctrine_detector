  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comments:** \nThe student provides a clear and concise explanation of the relationship between \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" within Christian teachings, particularly in Reformed theology. They effectively highlight the Calvinist perspective of irresistible grace and God's sovereign election. Additionally, the student offers a well-reasoned rejection of these concepts from an Islamic perspective, aligning with their understanding of free will and divine sovereignty. The inclusion of the concept of qadar further strengthens their argument by acknowledging Allah's knowledge and will, rather than a deterministic approach."
