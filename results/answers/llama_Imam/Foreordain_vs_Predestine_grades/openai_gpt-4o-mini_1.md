## [Answer](../Foreordain_vs_Predestine.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As-salamu alaykum,

The terms "foreordain" and "predestine" are indeed related concepts in Christian theology, specifically within the Calvinist tradition. In Islamic theology, we do not subscribe to predestination or foreordination as it is understood in Christianity.

In Christianity, particularly in Reformed theology, predestination refers to God's sovereign decision to elect some individuals for salvation and others for damnation. This concept is often linked to the idea of irresistible grace, where God's election is considered absolute and unchanging. The term "foreordain" suggests a prior determination or settling by God of what will happen in the future.

From an Islamic perspective, we reject the notion of predestination as it implies that God is responsible for the actions of individuals, which contradicts our understanding of human free will and moral responsibility. In Islam, Allah (God) is not the author of evil or sin; rather, He guides those who seek guidance and provides wisdom to those who ask.

In Islamic theology, we believe in the concept of qadar (fate), which refers to the inevitable outcome that has been decreed by Allah. However, this does not imply a predetermined course of events or a deterministic approach. Rather, it acknowledges that Allah knows what will happen and has willed it so.

In summary, while Christians use terms like "predestine" and "foreordain" to describe God's sovereign role in human affairs, Muslims do not subscribe to these concepts as they are based on a different understanding of divine sovereignty, human free will, and moral responsibility.
