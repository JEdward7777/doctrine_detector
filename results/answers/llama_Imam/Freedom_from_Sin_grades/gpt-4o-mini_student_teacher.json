  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student made a commendable effort to address the concern of encouraging believers to address sin for a deeper relationship with God from a Christian perspective, despite their Islamic background. The response effectively highlighted the hindrances that being 'bound' by sin can pose to a Christian's relationship with God and provided insightful suggestions for finding freedom from these bonds. While the student's understanding of Christian theology and scripture may not be as in-depth as a Christian theologian's, their response demonstrated a respectful and thoughtful approach to the topic."
