The emphasis on understanding God's nature, focusing on redemption, trusting in God's grace, seeking community, and practicing spiritual disciplines aligns well with the concern of encouraging believers to address sin for a deeper relationship with God. The acknowledgment of the limitations due to the author's expertise as an Imam is also commendable."
