  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This answer provides a detailed and respectful explanation of the importance of fulfilling promises in Islamic teachings. The student effectively articulates the significance of vows and promises in Islam, highlighting their sacred nature and emphasizing the importance of sincerity and integrity in fulfilling them. However, the response falls short in addressing the specific Christian perspective outlined in the question, as the focus primarily remains on Islamic beliefs and practices. To improve the grade, the student should have directly compared and contrasted the Christian and Islamic perspectives on vows and promises, showcasing a deeper understanding of the differences between the two faith traditions."
