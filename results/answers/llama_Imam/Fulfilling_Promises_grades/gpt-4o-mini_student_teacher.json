  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured explanation of the importance of fulfilling promises or vows from an Islamic perspective. However, the answer did not directly address the Christian perspective as asked in the question. While the student highlighted the significance of keeping promises before God in Islam, the specific Christian viewpoint on the importance of fulfilling vows or promises was not adequately addressed. It would have been beneficial to draw a clearer comparison with the Christian understanding and emphasize the unique aspects of Christian faith regarding this issue."
