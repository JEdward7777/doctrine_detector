It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of fulfilling promises or vows as a reflection of integrity and obedience to God in Islam. The connection to faith and the consequences of not fulfilling commitments are well articulated. The response could have included a more direct comparison or contrast with Christian beliefs on vows and promises to address the concern within a Christian worldview."
