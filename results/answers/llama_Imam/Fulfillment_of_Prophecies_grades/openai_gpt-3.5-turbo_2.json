The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the belief that when a prophecy is fulfilled, it means that God causes to happen what was predicted. It also acknowledges the importance of prophetic messages in other religions, such as Islam, while emphasizing the Christian perspective on the fulfillment of biblical prophecies. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of how God interacts with prophecy within a Christian worldview."
