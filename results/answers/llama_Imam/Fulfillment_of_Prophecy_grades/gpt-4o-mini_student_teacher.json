However, the response did not directly address the concern of recognizing the importance of prophecies in strengthening faith and understanding God's plan from a Christian worldview. Additionally, while the explanation was informative, it did not specifically focus on how fulfilled prophecies demonstrate God's sovereignty and faithfulness, as outlined in the reference answer."
