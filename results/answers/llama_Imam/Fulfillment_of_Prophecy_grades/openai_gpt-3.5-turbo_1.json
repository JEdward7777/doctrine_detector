It effectively addressed the concern by highlighting the significance of prophecies in strengthening faith and understanding God's plan. The inclusion of specific examples from Christian scripture further enhanced the response. However, a Christian-specific worldview would also emphasize the fulfillment of prophecies as pointing to Jesus as the Messiah and Savior, which could have been more explicitly stated in the context of the response."
