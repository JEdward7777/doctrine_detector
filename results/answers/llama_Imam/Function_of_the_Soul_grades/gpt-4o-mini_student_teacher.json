  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed and insightful analysis of the biblical concept of the soul and its importance for understanding human identity, the response did not directly address the concern about acknowledging the figurative language surrounding 'soul.' The student's perspective as a Muslim scholar was interesting, but the focus should have been on how acknowledging the biblical figurative uses of 'soul' provides deeper insight into human experience. The response could have been improved by directly connecting the biblical figurative language with a deeper understanding of human identity."
