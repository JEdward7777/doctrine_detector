It effectively addresses the concern by acknowledging the figurative language surrounding the term 'soul' and delving into its deeper implications. The integration of biblical references and exploration of the soul's divine origin, connection to God, eternal significance, and interdependence with the body are well-argued and align with a Christian worldview. The response effectively connects the biblical insights on the soul to the broader understanding of human experience and identity."
