  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of various sacred places in Islam beyond the Tabernacle or Temple. It correctly identifies the significance of the Ka'aba, Masjid al-Haram, the Prophet's Mosque, Al-Aqsa Mosque, and other important sites in Islam. The student effectively highlights the spiritual importance of these locations and their connection to Islamic history and faith. However, to improve the grade, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of these places in relation to the broader understanding of holiness and divine presence in Islam. It would have been beneficial to include references to Islamic teachings and scripture to strengthen the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
