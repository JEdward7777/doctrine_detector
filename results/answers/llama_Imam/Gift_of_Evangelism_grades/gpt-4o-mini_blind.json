  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and respectful explanation of the concept of evangelists in Christianity from the perspective of an individual from the Islamic tradition. The student shows understanding of the role and importance of evangelists within the Christian faith. However, the grade is slightly lower due to the mention of \"peace be upon him\" in reference to Jesus Christ, which is not a Christian belief but rather a Muslim phrase. This might cause confusion or misrepresentation of Christian beliefs. Overall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the topic."
