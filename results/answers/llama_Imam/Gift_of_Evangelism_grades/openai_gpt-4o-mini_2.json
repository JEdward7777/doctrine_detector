However, there was a slight deviation in focusing on the broader concept of evangelism rather than delving deeply into the specific spiritual gifts related to evangelism and their role in the church. Nonetheless, the response demonstrated a respectful and insightful comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on evangelism, which added value to the overall discussion."
