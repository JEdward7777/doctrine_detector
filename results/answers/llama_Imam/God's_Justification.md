## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Praise be to Allah, the Most Merciful and Just. In Islam, we believe that God's justice is not limited by human notions of fairness or equality. His wisdom and mercy are beyond our comprehension.

In Islam, Allah's justification of sinners is a process known as "Tawbah" (repentance). Tawbah involves a sincere turning away from one's sinful ways, followed by a commitment to obeying Allah's commands and avoiding future wrongdoing.

Justification in Islam entails the following:

1. Acknowledging one's sin: The first step towards justification is acknowledging one's sin and recognizing its gravity.
2. Seeking forgiveness: The sinner must seek Allah's forgiveness, which involves expressing regret for their actions and a desire to change.
3. Making amends (Qada): If possible, the sinner should make amends for any harm caused by their sinful behavior. This may involve restitution or making things right with those affected.
4. Purification (Taharah): The sinner must purify themselves through acts of worship, charity, and other virtuous deeds to remove the stain of sin.
5. Ongoing effort: Justification in Islam is not a one-time event; it requires ongoing effort and commitment to following Allah's commands and avoiding future wrongdoing.

In Surat Al-Furqan (Chapter 25), Verse 68, Allah says:

"And those who when they commit indecencies or wrongs (do) them, expiate earnestly, that is, for those who repent and correct their faults."

This verse highlights the importance of sincerity in seeking forgiveness. Allah's justification of sinners is contingent upon their genuine effort to change and avoid future wrongdoing.

In conclusion, justification in Islam involves a process of acknowledging one's sin, seeking forgiveness, making amends when possible, purifying oneself through righteous deeds, and committing to ongoing efforts to follow Allah's commands. May Allah guide us all towards the path of righteousness and justification.
