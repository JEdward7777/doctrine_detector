## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that the Quranic understanding of Jesus (peace be upon him) is different from the Christian narrative. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus was a prophet sent by Allah (God) to guide His people. While the Quran affirms Jesus' prophethood and his miracles, it also presents a unique perspective on his message.

In John 1:18-20, Jesus says, "No one has ever seen God, but the only Son, who is also the Father's Son—indeed He is the only one from the Father—has made him known. There is the Father’s only begotten Son (Jesus Christ). Any other 'son' or 'father' that you may have heard about in the world are not like this, because there is only One who is good, and that is God."
