  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided does not directly address the question regarding Jesus stating, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God'. While it mentions Islamic perspectives on Jesus, it does not delve into an analysis of the specific biblical statement made by Jesus. Additionally, the interpretation given in the provided text does not align with Christian beliefs about Jesus being the Son of God. A stronger connection to the biblical context and Christian theology would have improved the grade."
