## Question [God as Good](../../../questions/God_as_Good.md)

## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that the Quranic understanding of Jesus (peace be upon him) is different from the Christian narrative. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus was a prophet sent by Allah (God) to guide His people. While the Quran affirms Jesus' prophethood and his miracles, it also presents a unique perspective on his message.

In John 1:18-20, Jesus says, "No one has ever seen God, but the only Son, who is also the Father's Son—indeed He is the only one from the Father—has made him known. There is the Father’s only begotten Son (Jesus Christ). Any other 'son' or 'father' that you may have heard about in the world are not like this, because there is only One who is good, and that is God."

Grade: 40

Comment: The response provided does not directly address the question regarding Jesus stating, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God'. While it mentions Islamic perspectives on Jesus, it does not delve into an analysis of the specific biblical statement made by Jesus. Additionally, the interpretation given in the provided text does not align with Christian beliefs about Jesus being the Son of God. A stronger connection to the biblical context and Christian theology would have improved the grade.
