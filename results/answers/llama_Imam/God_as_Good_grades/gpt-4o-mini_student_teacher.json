The mention of Jesus being a prophet in Islamic teachings is insightful but does not fully address the core of the question regarding the significance of God as the ultimate standard of goodness. Additionally, the student's response did not directly explain the meaning behind Jesus' statement about God being the only one who is good. Further references to Christian theology and the concept of God's moral perfection would have strengthened the answer."
