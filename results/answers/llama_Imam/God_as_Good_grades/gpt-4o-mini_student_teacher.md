## Question [God as Good](../../../questions/God_as_Good.md)
What does Jesus mean when he states, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God'?

## Correct Answer
This statement emphasizes the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.

## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that the Quranic understanding of Jesus (peace be upon him) is different from the Christian narrative. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus was a prophet sent by Allah (God) to guide His people. While the Quran affirms Jesus' prophethood and his miracles, it also presents a unique perspective on his message.

In John 1:18-20, Jesus says, "No one has ever seen God, but the only Son, who is also the Father's Son—indeed He is the only one from the Father—has made him known. There is the Father’s only begotten Son (Jesus Christ). Any other 'son' or 'father' that you may have heard about in the world are not like this, because there is only One who is good, and that is God."

Grade: 50

Comment: While the student provided relevant information from an Islamic perspective regarding Jesus, the answer did not directly address the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs from a Christian worldview. The mention of Jesus being a prophet in Islamic teachings is insightful but does not fully address the core of the question regarding the significance of God as the ultimate standard of goodness. Additionally, the student's response did not directly explain the meaning behind Jesus' statement about God being the only one who is good. Further references to Christian theology and the concept of God's moral perfection would have strengthened the answer.
