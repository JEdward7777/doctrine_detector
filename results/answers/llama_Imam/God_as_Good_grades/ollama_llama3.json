  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response effectively highlights the biblical passage that emphasizes God's moral perfection and righteousness as the ultimate standard of goodness, which aligns with the concern about recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. The quote from John 1:18-20 specifically emphasizes Jesus' role in revealing the Father's goodness, which is a key aspect of Christian theology.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by further exploring the implications of this passage for our understanding of goodness and how it shapes our actions and beliefs. Additionally, while the response provides a brief biblical reference, it could benefit from more explicit connections to the concern about recognizing the source of goodness.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical passage and its relevance to the concern, but could be improved with further development and application."
