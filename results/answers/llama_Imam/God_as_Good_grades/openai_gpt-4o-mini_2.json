The reference to John 1:18-20 is relevant in highlighting the unique Christian belief in Jesus as the only begotten Son of God who reveals the Father. The response could be improved by further elaborating on how this Christian understanding of Jesus as the ultimate source of goodness impacts beliefs and actions in a practical sense."
