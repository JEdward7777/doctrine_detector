## Question [God as Good](../../../questions/God_as_Good.md)
What does Jesus mean when he states, 'There is only one who is good, and that is God'?

## Correct Answer
This statement emphasizes the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.

## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that the Quranic understanding of Jesus (peace be upon him) is different from the Christian narrative. According to Islamic teachings, Jesus was a prophet sent by Allah (God) to guide His people. While the Quran affirms Jesus' prophethood and his miracles, it also presents a unique perspective on his message.

In John 1:18-20, Jesus says, "No one has ever seen God, but the only Son, who is also the Father's Son—indeed He is the only one from the Father—has made him known. There is the Father’s only begotten Son (Jesus Christ). Any other 'son' or 'father' that you may have heard about in the world are not like this, because there is only One who is good, and that is God."

Grade: 80

Comment: The response effectively integrates the given answer about moral perfection and goodness in relation to God with the concern about recognizing the source of goodness in actions and beliefs from a Christian perspective. The reference to John 1:18-20 is relevant in highlighting the unique Christian belief in Jesus as the only begotten Son of God who reveals the Father. The response could be improved by further elaborating on how this Christian understanding of Jesus as the ultimate source of goodness impacts beliefs and actions in a practical sense.
