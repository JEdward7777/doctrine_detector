However, the response does not align directly with the question's focus on a Christian worldview. The content related to Allah and Islamic theology does not accurately reflect the Christian understanding of God's selective grace towards His people. The answer would benefit from explicitly addressing how the concept of a remnant is understood and exemplified within Christian theology and the Bible."
