It effectively highlights the selective grace of God towards those who remain faithful and obedient to their covenant with Him. The student provides clear examples from Quranic narratives to support their claims. Additionally, the connection between the remnant idea and the concept of \"Fitra\" is well-articulated. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter from a Christian specific worldview."
