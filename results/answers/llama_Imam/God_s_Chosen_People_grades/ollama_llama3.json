The examples from Quranic narratives effectively illustrate the theme, and the discussion on mercy, justice, and individual commitment to righteousness is well-done.\n\nHowever, while the response touches on the significance of being chosen by God, it could be more explicit in emphasizing this aspect. For instance, the phrase \"selective grace\" could be further developed to demonstrate how this concept relates to the concern about recognizing the significance of being chosen by God.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the remnant theme in Islamic theology and its implications for individual faith and devotion."
