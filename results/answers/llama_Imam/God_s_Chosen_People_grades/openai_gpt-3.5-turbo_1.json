  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful exploration of the concept of a remnant in Islamic theology, discussing various narratives and contexts where this idea is present. The explanation of how the remnant represents God's selective grace towards the faithful is well articulated and demonstrates a strong understanding of the concept. The connections drawn between the remnant theme and Allah's mercy, justice, and emphasis on individual commitment are clear and supported by relevant examples. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of being chosen by God within the context of the remnant concept. Overall, this is a well-written and thoughtful analysis from an Islamic theological perspective."
