It acknowledges the significance of being chosen by God, emphasizing that true faith and devotion are not necessarily reflected in numerical majorities. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that being chosen by God is ultimately through faith in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, not just through individual commitment and obedience to God's commands. This distinction aligns with the Christian belief in salvation through Christ alone."
