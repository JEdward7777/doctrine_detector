  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60. \n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of the concept of being \"called by your name\" in Islamic theology, they did not directly address the specified concern of exploring the implications of identity and belonging to God in a Christian's life. The answer includes valuable insights on intimacy, personal connection, guidance, and love between the believer and Allah, but it lacks a Christian-specific perspective on the topic. To improve the grade, the student should have focused more on how the concept of being called by God's name reflects identity and belonging within a Christian worldview."
