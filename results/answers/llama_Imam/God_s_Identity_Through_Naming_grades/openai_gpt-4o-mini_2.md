What a beautiful question, brother!

In Islamic theology, being "called by your name" is a metaphor that reflects the profound intimacy and personal connection between an individual believer (mu'min) and Allah. This concept is rooted in several key verses in the Quran:

1. "And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me." (Quran 2:186)
2. "And [mention] when you invoked your Lord for relief, saying, 'Indeed my Lord, I am oppressed with severe suffering - and You are [over] me, Most Merciful.' So do We respond to the one who prays when he calls upon Us." (Quran 25:5-6)

These verses highlight God's proximity and responsiveness to each individual's prayer and supplication. In essence, Allah is saying, "I know you by name" â€“ I have a personal connection with you, and I am always within reach.

This concept has far-reaching implications for our relationship with God:

1. Personalized guidance: Just as we address others by their names, we are encouraged to address Allah in a personalized manner, recognizing His unique guidance and wisdom tailored specifically to us.
2. Unconditional love: Being "called by your name" signifies that Allah loves each of us unconditionally, without exception or distinction. This love is the foundation of our spiritual journey.
3. Intimacy and communication: The Quranic metaphor emphasizes the importance of direct communication with Allah, trusting that He hears and responds to our prayers, even when we don't fully understand His plans or intentions.
4. Unique purpose: Being called by your name implies a unique purpose or role assigned to each individual, reflecting their specific strengths, talents, and contributions to humanity.

In conclusion, being "called by your name" underscores the profound intimacy and personal connection between an individual believer and Allah. It is a powerful reminder of God's unconditional love, personalized guidance, and responsiveness to our prayers and supplications.
