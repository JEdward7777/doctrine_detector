  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-developed explanation of the Islamic perspective on the significance of God's call, emphasizing intentionality and purpose in Allah's interaction with humanity. The response effectively discusses the deliberate nature of Allah's invitation and the importance of human agency and moral responsibility in responding to His call.
