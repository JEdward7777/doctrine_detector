# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, the concept of "calling" (da'wah) has profound implications for our understanding of Allah's intentions and purposes. The call of God refers to His invitation to humanity to follow Him and submit to His will.

The significance of intentionality or purpose in the term "call" lies in its connotation of deliberate and calculated action on the part of Allah. It implies that He has a specific intent and objective, which is to guide humankind towards the path of righteousness and salvation.

In Islamic scripture, the call of God is often described as a deliberate invitation (du'aa) or summons (ajrƒÅ') to humanity. This emphasizes Allah's active role in calling people to Himself, rather than simply allowing them to stumble upon His way. The call is seen as an intentional act of divine mercy and guidance, aimed at helping individuals recognize their true purpose and fulfill their obligations to Him.

The implication of intentionality or purpose in the term "call" also highlights the importance of human agency and response. Just as Allah's call requires a deliberate and conscious response from humanity, so too does it require a genuine acceptance and submission to His will. This underscores the significance of free will and moral responsibility in Islam, as individuals are called upon to make choices that align with or reject Allah's guidance.

In this context, the term "call" also carries connotations of urgency and importance. Just as Allah's call is seen as an invitation to a higher purpose and spiritual destiny, so too does it imply a sense of gravity and solemnity. The call of God is not a trivial matter; rather, it is a matter of life and death, with eternal consequences for those who respond positively or negatively.

In summary, the term "call" in Islamic theology implies intentionality or purpose on the part of Allah, emphasizing His deliberate and calculated action to guide humanity towards righteousness and salvation. This connotation underscores the importance of human agency, moral responsibility, and the urgency of responding to Allah's call in a way that aligns with His will and purposes.
