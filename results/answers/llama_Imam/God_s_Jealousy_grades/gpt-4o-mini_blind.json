  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: The student provided a thoughtful analysis of the concept of God's jealousy in the Bible, recognizing its relational and exclusive aspects while also highlighting the differences between the Islamic perspective on Allah's attributes. However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing that when the Bible speaks of God's jealousy, it is within the context of His holiness and righteousness, rather than implying any imperfection in His character. Additionally, a clearer distinction between the nature of jealousy in human relationships versus God's jealousy would have been beneficial. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding but could have delved deeper into the theological nuances."
