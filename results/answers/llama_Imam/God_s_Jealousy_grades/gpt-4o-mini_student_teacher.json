  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out analysis of the concept of jealousy as described in the Bible and its implications for understanding God's character. They effectively acknowledged the historical and cultural context of the biblical texts while drawing parallels with Islamic beliefs. However, the student's response may have strayed too far from the Christian worldview by emphasizing the Islamic perspective on Allah's attributes and contradicting the notion of God's jealousy. A more focused discussion on how God's jealousy relates to His desire for spiritual fidelity, as highlighted in the reference answer, would have strengthened their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
