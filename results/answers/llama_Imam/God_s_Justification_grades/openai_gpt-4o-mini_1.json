The response fails to address the foundational belief that God justifies sinners through faith in Jesus for salvation, neglecting the central Christian teaching on justification. It is important to clearly outline the fundamental differences between the Christian and Islamic views on justification to highlight the unique significance of Jesus Christ in the Christian understanding of salvation."
