However, as a Muslim Imam, they missed the opportunity to highlight the doctrinal differences between Islamic beliefs about Allah's names and attributes and the Christian understanding of 'Yahweh.' The response could have demonstrated a deeper theological understanding by contrasting the nature of God as presented in Islam with the concept of 'Yahweh' in Christianity. Additionally, more focus on the scriptural significance and implications of 'Yahweh' in the context of the Bible would have strengthened the answer."
