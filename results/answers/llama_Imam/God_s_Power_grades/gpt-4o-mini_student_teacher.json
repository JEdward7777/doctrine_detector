  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and thoughtful explanation of the term \"Almighty\" within the Islamic context, emphasizing Allah's independence, self-sufficiency, limitlessness, and eternality. However, the student does not directly address the concern about understanding God's omnipotence being fundamental to faith and worship. While the student's response is informative and reflects a deep understanding of the term, the focus on Islamic theology rather than a broader Christian perspective may affect the overall grade."
