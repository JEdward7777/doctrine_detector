However, while the response beautifully elaborates on the Islamic perspective on God's promises, it could have included more direct references to the specific concern provided, emphasizing how understanding these promises helps believers trust in God's faithfulness in their own lives. A more explicit connection between the concept of God's promises and personal trust in His faithfulness would have enhanced the response further."
