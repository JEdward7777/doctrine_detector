The emphasis on reading the Quran, seeking knowledge, self-reflection, intuition, seeking guidance from scholars, prayer, and trust in Allah's wisdom is commendable. However, the answer could have further emphasized the importance of seeking guidance through consistent prayer and submission to Allah's will. Overall, a well-rounded response with a good blend of practical steps and spiritual advice."
