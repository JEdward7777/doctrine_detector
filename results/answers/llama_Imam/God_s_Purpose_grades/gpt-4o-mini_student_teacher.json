  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provides thoughtful and practical advice on discerning God's plan from an Islamic perspective, they rely heavily on Islamic teachings and practices rather than referencing the Bible or seeking counsel from mature Christians, which are important aspects of discernment according to a Christian worldview. However, their emphasis on reading the Quran, seeking knowledge, reflecting on strengths and weaknesses, listening to intuition, seeking guidance from scholars, praying, and trusting in God's wisdom are all valuable insights in the pursuit of understanding God's plan. Overall, the student engages well with the concern and provides a comprehensive response, but could improve by incorporating more specifically Christian practices and teachings."
