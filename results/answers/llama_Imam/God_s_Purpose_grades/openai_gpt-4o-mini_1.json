It effectively addresses the concern of believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose by offering practical and faith-centered guidance. The emphasis on seeking knowledge, reflecting on one's strengths and weaknesses, prayer, and trusting in Allah's wisdom align well with Islamic teachings. The response could have further emphasized the importance of seeking guidance from religious authorities and deepening one's faith through community involvement."
