The advice given aligns with seeking guidance through prayer, reading the Quran, seeking knowledge, introspection, consulting with scholars, and trusting in Allah's wisdom. The response effectively addresses the concern by addressing how believers might feel lost or confused about their purpose, providing guidance on how to seek clarity and find comfort in Allah's guidance. Great job on applying a Christian worldview lens to a Muslim perspective on discerning God's plan."
