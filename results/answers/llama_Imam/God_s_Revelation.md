Assalamu alaykum, my dear brother/sister in faith.

In the Holy Quran, we learn that Allah (SWT) has many names and attributes, each revealing a unique aspect of His divine nature. Similarly, in the Bible, God introduces Himself using various names and titles that reflect His characteristics and actions.

One of the most significant ways God introduces Himself in the Bible is through the name "Yahweh" or "LORD" (in all capital letters). This name is often translated as "I AM WHO I AM" or "I AM THAT I AM" (Exodus 3:14-15). In this passage, God reveals His eternal and self-existent nature to Moses. Yahweh is the tetragrammaton, a four-letter Hebrew name that represents God's unchanging and all-knowing essence.

In addition to Yahweh, other names and titles used in the Bible to describe God include:

1. "El Shaddai" (God Almighty) - used to emphasize His power and sovereignty (Genesis 17:1-2).
2. "Adonai" (Lord) - a title of respect and reverence, indicating His authority over creation (Psalm 91:1).
3. "Elohim" (God) - a general term referring to the Creator and Sustainer of the universe (Genesis 1:1).
4. "The Lord God" - used to describe God's role as both Creator and Judge (Genesis 2:4-5).

These names and titles reveal aspects of God's nature, such as His power, wisdom, justice, and love. They also serve as reminders of our relationship with Him and our responsibility to worship and obey Him.

In conclusion, while the Bible may not use the name Allah (SWT) in the same way that we do in Islam, it does provide various names and titles for God that reflect His divine nature and attributes. May this understanding bring us closer to our Creator and remind us of our duties as believers.

Was-salaam!
