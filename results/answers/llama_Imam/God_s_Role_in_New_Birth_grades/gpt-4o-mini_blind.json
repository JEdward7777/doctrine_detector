The answer fails to address God's role in the process of a person being born again as understood within Christianity, and instead focuses on Islamic beliefs and practices. From a Christian perspective, being born again is tied to the concept of being spiritually reborn through faith in Jesus Christ and the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness in addressing the Christian understanding of being born again."
