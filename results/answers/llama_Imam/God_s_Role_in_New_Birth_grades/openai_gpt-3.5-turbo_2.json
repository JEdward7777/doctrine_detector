While it offers valuable insights and emphasizes seeking guidance and forgiveness from Allah, it does not fully address the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace as the central factors in the process of salvation. Additionally, the response lacks clarity in explicitly stating that new birth is a result of divine initiative rather than human effort."
