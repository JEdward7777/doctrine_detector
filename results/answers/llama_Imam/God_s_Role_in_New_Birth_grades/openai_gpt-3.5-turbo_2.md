## [Answer](../God_s_Role_in_New_Birth.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Sister, I'm happy to clarify this important concept for you. In Islam, we believe that God's role in the process of a person being born again is crucial.

In Islamic theology, the concept of "born again" is not exactly equivalent to the Christian concept, as Muslims believe that salvation and forgiveness are available to all people through the mercy of Allah (God) without the need for a specific moment or experience. However, I can provide some insight on how Islam views the process of spiritual renewal and transformation.

In Islamic tradition, we believe that every person is born with a fitrah (natural inclination towards good) and a nafs (self). As individuals grow and make choices in life, their nafs can become inclined towards evil or sin. However, Allah's mercy and forgiveness are always available to guide us back to the right path.

The process of being "born again" in an Islamic context might be understood as a transformative experience that allows a person to:

1. Recognize their own shortcomings and the need for spiritual renewal.
2. Seek guidance from Allah and His prophets, including the Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him).
3. Make amends with Allah through sincere repentance (tawbah) and good deeds.

In this process, God plays a crucial role by:

1. Guiding individuals towards righteousness: Allah guides those who seek His path, as stated in the Quran (28:56).
2. Forgiving sins: Allah is Merciful and Forgiving, offering forgiveness to those who repent and make amends.
3. Illuminating the heart: Through spiritual guidance and introspection, Allah can illuminate a person's heart with wisdom, compassion, and understanding.

In Islamic spirituality, this process of being "born again" might be seen as a continuous journey of self-reflection, spiritual growth, and seeking guidance from Allah. It involves recognizing one's own limitations, seeking forgiveness, and making efforts to become a better servant of Allah.

May Allah guide us all on our respective journeys towards spiritual renewal and closeness to Him.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a well-explained perspective from an Islamic worldview on the concept of being "born again" and the role of Allah in the process of spiritual renewal. While it offers valuable insights and emphasizes seeking guidance and forgiveness from Allah, it does not fully address the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace as the central factors in the process of salvation. Additionally, the response lacks clarity in explicitly stating that new birth is a result of divine initiative rather than human effort.
