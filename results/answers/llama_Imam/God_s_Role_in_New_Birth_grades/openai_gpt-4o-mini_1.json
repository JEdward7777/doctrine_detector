While it articulates well the Islamic beliefs, it does not directly address the specific concern about recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation. The response could have further highlighted the point that ultimate spiritual renewal and transformation are ultimately the work of God's grace and sovereignty, regardless of individual effort or actions."
