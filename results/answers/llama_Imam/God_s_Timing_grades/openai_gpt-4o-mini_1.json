It explores how understanding the concept of appointed time fosters trust, patience, gratitude, contentment, and humility in relation to God's divine plan. The connection between God's timing and our expectations is clearly articulated and supported by relevant Quranic references and implications. The response effectively addresses the concern raised and provides a comprehensive perspective from an Islamic worldview."
