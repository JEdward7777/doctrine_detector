  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of the Day of Yahweh and its description in Old Testament scriptures. They provide relevant biblical references to support their claims and clearly explain the Islamic perspective on judgment and salvation. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the idea of God's punishment during the Day of Yahweh from a Christian worldview. The reference answer provided suggests a connection between God's punishment and the idea of a 'pouring out of God\u2019s wrath,' which could have been addressed in the student's response."
