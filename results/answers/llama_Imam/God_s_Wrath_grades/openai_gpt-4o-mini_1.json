However, the response does not directly address the concern about the nature of God's judgment and consequences for disbelief, which is a key aspect to consider when discussing divine wrath. In a Christian worldview, the consequences for disbelief are often described as eternal separation from God and a just punishment for sin. It would have been helpful to elaborate on this aspect in the response."
