However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern regarding God's punishment as a 'pouring out of God\u2019s wrath' on unbelievers. The response could have better connected this aspect of divine judgment with the consequences for disbelief, emphasizing the justice and holiness of God in meting out judgment. Additionally, a deeper exploration of how the Christian concept of God's judgment aligns or contrasts with Islamic beliefs could have enhanced the response."
