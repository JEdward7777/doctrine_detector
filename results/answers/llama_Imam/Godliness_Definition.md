## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that my knowledge is limited to what is revealed to me through Islamic sources and traditions. However, I can provide you with an understanding of how Muslims perceive godliness based on our sacred texts.

In Islam, we believe that Godliness (or Tauhid in Arabic) means to worship One God, submit to His will, and live a life that is pleasing to Him. We derive this concept from the Quranic verse: "And whoever submits his face to Allah and He is pleased with him - for indeed, He is the Accepting of repentance and the Merciful." (Quran 5:54)

In a broader sense, godliness in Islam encompasses:

1. Tawbah (Repentance): Sincere regret for past mistakes, seeking forgiveness, and making amends.
2. Taqwa (Fear or Piety of God): Having reverence and awe for Allah, recognizing His power, wisdom, and mercy.
3. Shukr (Gratitude): Expressing gratitude to Allah for His blessings and favors, no matter how great or small.
4. Istighfar (Asking Forgiveness): Seeking pardon from Allah for one's mistakes and shortcomings.

In terms of living one's life, godliness in Islam is demonstrated through:

1. Adherence to the Five Pillars of Islam: Shahada (testimony of faith), Salat (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting), and Hajj (pilgrimage).
2. Practicing good character: Being kind, compassionate, honest, just, and fair in one's dealings with others.
3. Showing mercy and compassion to all creation, including animals and the environment.

In summary, godliness in Islam is a multifaceted concept that encompasses submission to Allah's will, repentance, piety, gratitude, and a commitment to living a virtuous life that reflects His attributes of Mercy, Compassion, and Justice.
