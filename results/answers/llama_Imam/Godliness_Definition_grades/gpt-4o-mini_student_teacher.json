  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how Muslims perceive godliness based on Islamic teachings and traditions. While the response was comprehensive and insightful, there was a lack of clarity on how to incorporate godliness into daily life and actions, as the concern specifically requested. The response focused more on the theological and conceptual aspects of godliness within Islam rather than practical steps for implementing it in everyday life. Encouraging the student to provide more specific and practical examples or guidance on incorporating godliness into daily actions would have enhanced the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
