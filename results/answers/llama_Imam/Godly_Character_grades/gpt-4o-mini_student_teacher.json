  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response from an Islamic perspective, addressing virtues and characteristics indicative of godly character in Islam. However, the answer did not directly address the question about the fruits of the Holy Spirit within a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, it is important for the student to tailor the response specifically to the Christian context and the question asked."
