It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting specific virtues like piousness, forgiveness, patience, and others. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of these virtues in cultivating a godly character and how they reflect the nature of God as seen in Christianity. A stronger connection between the Islamic virtues mentioned and the concept of being led by the Holy Spirit in Christian belief would have enriched the response further."
