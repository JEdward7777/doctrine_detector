  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a respectful perspective from an Islamic point of view, acknowledging Jesus as a prophet. However, the grading is lowered as it lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview, particularly in emphasizing Jesus' divinity as the Son of God and the importance of faith in Him for healing. Additionally, the response could have included more references to specific biblical passages that illustrate Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals in accordance with Christian beliefs."
