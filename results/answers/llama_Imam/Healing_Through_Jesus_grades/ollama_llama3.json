  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals, highlighting his empathy, authority, faith, and connection with Allah. The example instances provided also show Jesus' authority over evil spirits and his ability to heal through prayer and faith.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about recognizing Jesus' authority over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing, as it only mentions Jesus' approach to healing and does not explicitly state that he has authority over evil spirits. Nevertheless, the response does acknowledge Jesus' connection with Allah and his role as a messenger, which implies an understanding of Jesus' divine authority.\n\nTo improve, the response could provide more explicit statements about Jesus' authority over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing, in addition to the examples provided."
