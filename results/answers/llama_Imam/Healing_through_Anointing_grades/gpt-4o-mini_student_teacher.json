  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed response on the practice of anointing in the New Testament, touching on its significance and examples in both the Old and New Testaments. However, the student did not directly address the concern of recognizing the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as part of Christian practice. Additionally, the student diverted the focus to Islamic theology, which was not necessary for answering the given question. The response could have been improved by focusing more on the Christian perspective and specifically addressing the concern provided."
