It effectively ties in biblical examples and teachings to support the significance of anointing with oil for seeking God's intervention and healing power. The integration of Islamic perspectives on seeking divine guidance adds depth to the analysis. A minor improvement could be to further emphasize the distinct Christian belief in the efficacy of anointing for healing within the context of faith and divine intervention."
