## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As-salamu alaykum (peace be upon you). The practice of anointing, also known as chrisma or unction, in the New Testament is indeed a fascinating and significant topic.

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ and His disciples often used anointing oil to heal and bless people. In fact, one of the most well-known examples is when Mary, the mother of Jesus, anointed Him for burial with expensive perfume (Mark 14:3-9). This act was seen as a sign of devotion and recognition of Jesus' divine mission.

The practice of anointing had its roots in the Old Testament, where prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah were anointed by God to perform specific tasks. In the New Testament, Jesus and His disciples used this same symbolism to convey divine authority and blessing (e.g., Matthew 3:11; Luke 4:18).

When it comes to healing, anointing with oil became a powerful means of invoking God's mercy and healing power. In James 5:14-15, we read that when believers are sick, they should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord. This passage emphasizes the importance of faith and prayer in seeking healing, while also recognizing the physical act of anointing as a means of expressing God's will.

In this context, anointing with oil can be seen as a symbol of God's presence and care for His people. Just as Jesus was anointed by Mary to prepare Him for burial, believers being anointed with oil are acknowledging their dependence on God's mercy and healing power.

In Islamic theology, we do not have a direct equivalent to the practice of anointing in Christianity. However, Muslims also believe in the importance of seeking divine guidance and intervention in times of need. In fact, many Hadiths (sayings) of the Prophet Muhammad emphasize the value of seeking treatment from medical professionals while also acknowledging God's sovereignty over all things.

In conclusion, the practice of anointing in the New Testament is a powerful symbol of God's love and care for His people. While its specific application may differ from Islamic practices, it underscores the importance of seeking divine guidance and intervention in times of need, whether through prayer, faith, or physical means like anointing with oil.

Wa alaykum as-salam (and peace be upon you).
