  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The response provided information based on the Islamic perspective rather than the Christian perspective, which was not the focus of the question. While the student attempted to draw parallels between Islamic beliefs and the story of Prophet Noah and the Ark, the answer did not address the question of who was allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant in Jewish tradition. The response also did not incorporate specific Christian doctrines or beliefs related to the Ark of the Covenant. A higher grade could have been achieved by focusing on the biblical account of the Ark of the Covenant as described in the Old Testament and addressing the question from a Christian perspective."
