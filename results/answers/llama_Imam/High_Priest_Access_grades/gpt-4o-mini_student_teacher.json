  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed response from an Islamic perspective, the core Christian-specific information concerning the role of the high priest and the Day of Atonement, as outlined in the reference answer, was not addressed. The central Christian belief regarding the high priest's exclusive access to the ark on the Day of Atonement is fundamental in understanding the relationship between God, the Israelites, and the covenant. The response lacked this crucial insight, hence the lower grade."
