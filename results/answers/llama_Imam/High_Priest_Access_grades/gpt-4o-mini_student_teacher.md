Assalamu alaikum, my brother.

In the Islamic perspective, we do not have direct access to the Ark of the Covenant as it is a Jewish relic that predates Islam. However, I can provide you with information based on the Quranic account and traditional Muslim understanding of the Ark's history.

According to the Quran (2:248-253), the Ark was built by Prophet Noah (peace be upon him) under Allah's guidance. The Ark was used to save a select group of believers and their families from the great flood that destroyed the wicked people on earth.

As for who was allowed to approach the Ark, it is mentioned in the Quran that only those who were righteous and believing in Allah and His prophet Noah (peace be upon him) were permitted to enter the Ark. The Quran describes them as "the believers" or "those who believed" (2:251).

In other words, only those who had a strong faith in Allah and His messenger Noah were allowed to approach the Ark and enter it with their families. This was a sign of their devotion to Allah's commands and their rejection of the wicked ways of the people around them.

It is also worth noting that the Ark was not just any ordinary vessel; it was a sacred trust from Allah, and only those who were pure of heart and free from sin were permitted to approach it. The Quran emphasizes this point by stating that only those who believed in Allah and His prophet Noah were allowed to enter the Ark (2:251).

In summary, my brother, according to Islamic understanding, only righteous believers who had faith in Allah and His messenger Noah were allowed to approach and enter the Ark of the Covenant under the circumstances described in the Quran.

Grade: 30

Comment: While the student provided a detailed response from an Islamic perspective, the core Christian-specific information concerning the role of the high priest and the Day of Atonement, as outlined in the reference answer, was not addressed. The central Christian belief regarding the high priest's exclusive access to the ark on the Day of Atonement is fundamental in understanding the relationship between God, the Israelites, and the covenant. The response lacked this crucial insight, hence the lower grade.
