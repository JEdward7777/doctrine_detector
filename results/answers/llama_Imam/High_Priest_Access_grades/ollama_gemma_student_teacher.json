  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the Islamic perspective on the Ark of the Covenant and correctly highlights the Quranic account. However, it does not address the specific concern related to the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant. The student's answer lacks the specificity and accuracy required to fully address the given concern."
