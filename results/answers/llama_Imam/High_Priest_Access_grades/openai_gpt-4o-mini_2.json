  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective regarding the Ark in relation to Prophet Noah and the believers. While the explanation was informative and well-written, it did not directly address the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant, as specified in the concern. Therefore, the grade is lower as it did not fully engage with the specific concern provided."
