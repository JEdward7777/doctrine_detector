## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Dear brother or sister, this is an excellent question. In Islamic tradition, we have a deep respect for the stories of the prophets, including Moses (peace be upon him), who led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt.

According to the Quran and Jewish traditions, when the Israelites were fleeing from Egypt, they had to leave in such haste that there was no time for their dough to rise. This is mentioned in several passages in the Quran, including Surah Al-Qasas (Quran 28:28-29).

In this context, eating unleavened bread, also known as matzoh or flatbread, was a practical necessity rather than a deliberate choice. The Israelites were instructed to take bread without yeast, which they had with them in their haste to leave Egypt.

Furthermore, the Quran and Islamic tradition emphasize that the Israelites' exodus from Egypt was a miraculous event, where Allah (Glory be to Him) intervened directly to free His chosen people from slavery. This event is considered a significant part of the prophets' stories and is commemorated during the Islamic month of Sha'ban.

In summary, the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt due to the urgency of their situation, rather than as a deliberate choice or ritual observance. This event serves as a testament to Allah's mercy and intervention on behalf of His chosen people. May Allah guide us all towards righteousness and wisdom.
