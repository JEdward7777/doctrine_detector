It appropriately acknowledges God's instructions and the significance of the event within Islamic and Jewish traditions. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating awareness of the historical context shaping religious practices. Great job incorporating insights from Islamic tradition and emphasizing the miraculous deliverance by Allah during the exodus."
