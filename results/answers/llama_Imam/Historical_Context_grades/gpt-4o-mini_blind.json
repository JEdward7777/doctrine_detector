However, the answer primarily focuses on providing insights into the biblical concept of remnant rather than illustrating specific events from Isaiah and Amos. While the examples provided are relevant in showcasing the idea of a faithful remnant, they could have been more directly tied to the content of Isaiah and Amos. Additionally, the explanation lacks depth and a clear connection to the concept as seen in these specific biblical books. More precise references to events in Isaiah and Amos would have strengthened the response and demonstrated a deeper understanding of the topic."
