  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive response detailing biblical events that illustrate the concept of a remnant. However, the answer lacks a clear connection to the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises. Additionally, the explanation from a Muslim perspective, while informative, does not address the concern of understanding the concept specifically within a Christian worldview. The student could improve by focusing more on the significance of the remnant in God's promises as outlined in the reference answer."
