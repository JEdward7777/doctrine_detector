  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of \"remnant\" in the biblical texts of Isaiah and Amos. They provide relevant examples from the Bible to illustrate the idea of a small group remaining faithful despite widespread apostasy and idolatry. However, the lack of acknowledgment of the Islamic perspective on the concept of remnant slightly diminishes the overall grade."
