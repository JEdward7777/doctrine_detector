## [Answer](../Historical_Context.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum,

As a Muslim Imam, I must acknowledge that our scriptures do not discuss the concept of "remnant" in the same context as the Hebrew Bible or the Christian New Testament. However, I can provide some insight into the biblical events that illustrate this concept.

In the Bible, the concept of "remnant" refers to a small group of people who remain faithful to God's covenant despite widespread apostasy and idolatry. This idea is prominent in the prophetic books of Isaiah and Amos.

Some key biblical events that illustrate the concept of remnant include:

1. The Israelites' return from exile: After the Babylonian conquest, a small group of Jews returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt the Temple (Ezra 2:64-67). This group represents the remnant who remained faithful despite the majority's apostasy.
2. The prophetic call to repentance: Prophets like Isaiah, Amos, and Jeremiah called upon the Israelites to return to God, warning them of impending judgment if they did not repent (Isaiah 1:18-20, Amos 5:14-15).
3. The story of Ruth: Although not explicitly mentioned as a remnant, Ruth's conversion to Judaism and her joining the family of Naomi represents a small group of faithful individuals who remained committed to God despite the majority's idolatry (Ruth 1:4-22).
4. The early Christian community: In the New Testament, the apostles' message focused on Jesus Christ as the savior for all nations (Matthew 28:18-20). This small group of believers represents the remnant who remained faithful to God's original covenant.

It is essential to note that these biblical events do not necessarily mirror the concept of remnant in Islamic scripture. However, they do illustrate the idea of a small group remaining faithful despite widespread apostasy and idolatry.
