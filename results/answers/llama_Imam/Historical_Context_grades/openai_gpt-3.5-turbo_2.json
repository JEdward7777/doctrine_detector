  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided by the Imam is informative and respectful in discussing the concept of \"remnant\" within the biblical context. The explanation of key biblical events related to the remnant is clear and relevant to the concern raised. The response effectively ties in the significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises, drawing insights from both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian New Testament. However, it would have been beneficial to include more direct references to Islamic scripture to fully address the concern raised."
