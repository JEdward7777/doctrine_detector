  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and insightful exploration of how the Roman practice of crucifixion impacted the perception of the cross in early Christianity from an Islamic perspective. The student effectively discusses the initial view of the cross as a symbol of shame and suffering and how early Christians transformed it into a symbol of redemption, sacrifice, and love. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific Christian theological implications and the transformation from death to life through the cross, as emphasized in the reference answer. The inclusion of Christian theological perspectives and biblical references would have strengthened the answer."
