The response portrays figures like Abraham, Jacob, Joshua, and Samuel as Muslims and attributes their actions to submission to Allah, which is not consistent with the Christian understanding of these events. The focus should have been on God's interaction with His people in the Bible, not conflating the Islamic and Christian faiths. The student would benefit from a better understanding of the doctrinal differences between Islam and Christianity when discussing Biblical narratives."
