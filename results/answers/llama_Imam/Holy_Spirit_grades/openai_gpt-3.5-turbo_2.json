  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of clear, contextual teaching to prevent misconceptions about the Holy Spirit's identity and work. However, it does not directly address the recommended approach of introducing the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity and explaining His role in the believer's life through sound teaching. While the response demonstrates sensitivity and respect towards different faith traditions, it falls short of directly addressing the concern provided."
