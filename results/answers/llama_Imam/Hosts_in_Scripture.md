Assalamu alaikum,

The term "hosts" (in Arabic: سجود, Sujud) has a rich meaning in Islamic scriptures and traditions. It refers to the angels who are believed to be present in the presence of Allah, as described in various verses of the Quran.

In the context of Islamic prayer (Salah), we recite during the second Rak'ah (unit of prayer): "Rabbana wa lakumu jamee'ul 'Izzati wa Sa'jud (Our Lord, to You all praise and worship, with all hosts and angels, and all creatures in the heavens and on earth)..." (Quran 37:165).

Here, we're acknowledging Allah's dominion over all creation, including the "hosts" or angels who are His servants. These angels are believed to be present in every Salah, listening to our supplications and recording our deeds.

The term "hosts" also encompasses other divine beings mentioned in the Quran, such as the Malak (angels) and Jinn (supernatural entities). In Islamic theology, these beings serve Allah's will and carry out specific tasks. For example, the Archangel Gabriel is believed to be responsible for conveying revelations from Allah to prophets like Muhammad (peace be upon him).

In a broader sense, the concept of "hosts" symbolizes the majesty and omnipotence of Allah, reminding us that we are not alone in our prayers or actions. It encourages us to have humility, gratitude, and reverence when approaching the divine.

I hope this clarifies the concept of "hosts" in Islamic scripture and tradition. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.

Was-salaam.
