  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"hosts\" in Islamic scripture and tradition, showcasing the student's knowledge and understanding of the concept within their faith. However, the grade is lowered as the response lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the term \"hosts\" and does not align with a Christian understanding of angels. It is important to be mindful of the doctrinal differences between Christianity and Islam when discussing theological concepts."
