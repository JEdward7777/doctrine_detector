However, the response did not address the specified concern regarding the impact of understanding the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority on a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles from a Christian worldview. The answer should have incorporated a Christian perspective on the term \"hosts\" and its implications for spiritual warfare and divine authority."
