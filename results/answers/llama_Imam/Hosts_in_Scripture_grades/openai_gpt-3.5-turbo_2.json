The inclusion of relevant Quranic verses and the explanation of the roles of angels and other divine beings demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. However, the response does not directly address the concern regarding the impact of understanding spiritual warfare and divine authority on a believer's perspective. Integrating this aspect would have strengthened the overall response and provided a more holistic view from a Christian perspective."
