  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the term \"hosts\" in Islamic scripture and tradition, demonstrating a solid understanding of the concept within an Islamic worldview. However, there is limited engagement with the concern raised regarding the impact of understanding spiritual warfare and divine authority on a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to address this concern more directly and discuss how the concept of \"hosts\" relates to spiritual warfare and divine authority within an Islamic context."
