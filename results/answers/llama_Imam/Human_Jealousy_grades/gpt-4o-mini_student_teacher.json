The steps outlined are practical and reflective of seeking spiritual guidance. However, there is a heavier emphasis on individual reflection and improvement rather than emphasizing open communication and trust in the relationship itself, which is the key aspect highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging more focus on addressing jealousy within the relationship dynamics would strengthen the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
