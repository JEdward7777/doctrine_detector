  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 40.\n\nWhile the student accurately presented the Christian perspective on righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ's sacrifice and redemption, they failed to fully address the concern provided. The concern highlighted the importance of clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus for understanding salvation. The student's answer does not specifically emphasize Jesus as the sole basis for human righteousness in Christianity. Additionally, the student's comparison to Islam, while informative, does not directly address the Christian perspective outlined in the provided reference answer.\n\nTherefore, the student's grade is lower as they did not sufficiently address the concern in a Christian-specific context."
