However, the response failed to directly address the concern of clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus for understanding salvation. The focus remained more on contrasting the two faith traditions rather than providing a clear explanation of how faith in Jesus leads to righteousness and salvation in the Christian worldview. More direct engagement with the concern would have strengthened the response."
