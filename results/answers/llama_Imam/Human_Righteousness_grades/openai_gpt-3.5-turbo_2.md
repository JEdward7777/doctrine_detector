## Question [Human Righteousness](../../../questions/Human_Righteousness.md)
How can a person be declared righteous according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesusâ€™ righteousness to them.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that the concept of righteousness in Christianity is different from our understanding of righteousness (birr) in Islam. In Islam, we believe that Allah (SWT) has ordained certain criteria for human righteousness, which are based on His revelation and guidance.

According to Christian teachings, a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ's sacrifice and redemption. Christians believe that humanity fell short of God's standards due to sin, and that Jesus' death on the cross atoned for this sin, making it possible for people to have a right relationship with God.

In Christianity, righteousness is often associated with justification by faith, where one accepts Jesus as their savior and lord. This is seen as a gift from God, achieved through faith in Christ's sacrifice (Romans 3:24-26, Ephesians 2:8-9). Christians also believe that this right relationship with God is maintained through ongoing faithfulness and obedience to God's will.

While I respect the Christian faith's emphasis on Jesus' sacrifice as a means of achieving righteousness, it differs significantly from Islam's understanding of birr. In Islam, we believe that Allah (SWT) has ordained specific actions and qualities as essential for human righteousness, including:

1. Believing in One God (tawhid): Recognizing Allah (SWT) as the sole Creator and Sustainer.
2. Performing the Five Pillars: Fasting during Ramadan, praying five times a day, giving charity regularly, making pilgrimage to Mecca once in a lifetime, and declaring one's faith publicly.
3. Living a righteous life: Avoiding evil deeds, treating others with compassion, justice, and kindness.

In Islam, righteousness is not solely dependent on faith in a specific individual or event but rather on our actions and character as individuals. We believe that Allah (SWT) judges us based on our intentions, words, and deeds, and that true righteousness comes from submitting to His will and following the guidance of the Quran and the Prophetic tradition.

While I recognize the similarities between faiths, it's essential to understand that these differences in understanding righteousness reflect fundamental disparities in our beliefs about God, revelation, and human nature. As a Muslim Imam, I must emphasize the importance of maintaining spiritual integrity within our own faith tradition while respecting the diversity of religious experiences and convictions.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response provides a thorough comparison between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on righteousness, emphasizing the differences in understanding and criteria for righteousness. The student effectively communicates the Christian view that faith in Jesus is the basis for human righteousness leading to salvation. However, the response could have further highlighted the unique Christian belief that trusting in Jesus leads to an imputed righteousness from Him, rather than through one's own actions or character, in response to the concern raised.
