The explanation of Christianity's view on righteousness is clear and accurate. However, the response does not directly address the concern about clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus, which is essential for understanding salvation from a Christian perspective. More emphasis on the centrality of faith in Jesus for righteousness and salvation would have strengthened the response."
