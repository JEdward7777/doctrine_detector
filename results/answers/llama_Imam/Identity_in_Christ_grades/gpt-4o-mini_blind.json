While the explanation is well-written and provides insight into Islamic beliefs, it does not align with a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, the phrase \"I have called you by name\" carries a different significance related to God's personal relationship with His people, as seen in Isaiah 43:1. The answer could have been improved by providing an interpretation rooted in Christian theology."
