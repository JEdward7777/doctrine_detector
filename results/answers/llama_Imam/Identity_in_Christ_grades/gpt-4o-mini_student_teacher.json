  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60. While the student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding God calling Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) by name, the response did not directly address the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. The answer focused more on the specific context within Islam rather than providing a broader understanding applicable to believers in Christ. The reference answer emphasizes a personal relationship with God, which was not clearly articulated in the student's response. The student did offer insights about God's sovereignty and mercy, but the answer lacked specificity regarding individual identity and value as a believer in Christ."
