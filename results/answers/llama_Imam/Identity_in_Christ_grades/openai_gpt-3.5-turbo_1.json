The focus on Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and Islamic beliefs does not align with a Christian worldview, which emphasizes a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as the source of identity and value for believers. Incorporating biblical references and teachings about individual identity and worth in Christ would have been more relevant in addressing the concern raised."
