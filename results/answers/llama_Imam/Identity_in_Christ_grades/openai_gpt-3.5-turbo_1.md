## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum,

The phrase "I have called you by name" is a powerful and profound statement found in the Quranic verse: "And indeed We created man from an extract of clay. Then We caused him to inherit Our commandments, (and) guided him to the right path. And behold! We told him, 'You will surely die (as everyone does)' - yet he was arrogant about himself and turned away." (Quran 32:7-9)

In this context, God is speaking directly to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), informing him that He has chosen him for a special role. The phrase "I have called you by name" signifies that God is acknowledging the Prophet's existence and destiny.

In Islamic theology, this verse is often interpreted as God's declaration of His intent to guide and communicate with humanity through the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). By calling him by name, God is establishing a direct connection with the Prophet, underscoring his unique role as a messenger and a prophet sent to guide humanity.

Furthermore, in Islamic tradition, the phrase "I have called you by name" is seen as an expression of God's sovereignty and mercy. It implies that God has known the Prophet since the beginning of time and has chosen him for this sacred mission.

In our daily lives, we can reflect on this verse by recognizing that our existence is not a mere coincidence; rather, it is part of God's grand plan. Just as He called the Prophet by name, so too has He called each of us to serve Him in our own unique ways. May we strive to answer His call and fulfill our responsibilities as Muslims.

Wa alaykum salam.

Comment: While the response provides a well-explained perspective from Islamic theology on the phrase "I have called you by name," it does not address the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. The focus on Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and Islamic beliefs does not align with a Christian worldview, which emphasizes a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as the source of identity and value for believers. Incorporating biblical references and teachings about individual identity and worth in Christ would have been more relevant in addressing the concern raised.
