  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective about the name Jesus, which is commendable. However, the concern was specifically about the Christian significance of Jesus's name and His role as Savior. The student did not address this concern directly and instead focused on the Islamic beliefs about Jesus. The reference answer emphasizes Jesus's purpose as saving people from their sins, which is a key Christian doctrine. Therefore, the student's answer, while informative from an Islamic viewpoint, did not fully align with the given concern from a Christian worldview."
