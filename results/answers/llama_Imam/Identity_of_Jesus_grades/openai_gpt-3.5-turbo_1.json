However, it does not directly address the concern raised regarding the significance of Jesus's name meaning \"Yahweh saves\" and His role as Savior in Christianity. The response could have been strengthened by contrasting the Islamic perspective with the Christian belief in Jesus as the Savior who saves people from their sins according to His name."
