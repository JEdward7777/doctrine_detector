## [Answer](../Identity_of_Jesus.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, my brother/sister in faith. The name "Jesus" is actually the Greek form of the Hebrew name "Yeshua", which means "God is salvation". In Arabic, it's written as "عيسى" (Isa).

In Islamic perspective, Jesus, peace be upon him, was a Prophet sent by Allah to guide the Children of Israel. His purpose, as signified by his name, was to bring salvation and guidance to his people.

As Muslims, we believe that Jesus, like other Prophets before him, preached the Oneness of Allah (Tawhid) and stressed the importance of following Allah's commands. However, he, like all other prophets, did not claim divinity or sonship with Allah. This is a crucial distinction between Islam and Christianity.

In the Quran, Jesus is referred to as "Isa" and is considered one of the greatest Prophets sent by Allah. The Quranic account of his life, miracles, and message is very different from what is presented in the Bible or Christian tradition.

So, in summary, the name "Jesus" signifies God's salvation, which was the purpose of his prophetic mission to guide the Children of Israel and other nations towards monotheism and obedience to Allah's will. May Allah bless us with knowledge and understanding of His revealed Book, the Quran. Amin.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides a good explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus, emphasizing his role as a Prophet and the importance of monotheism. However, it does not fully address the concern about understanding the significance of Jesus's name and His role as Savior from a Christian worldview. The response is well-written and informative but lacks a direct comparison or engagement with the significance of Jesus as the Savior according to the Christian belief system.
