The examples chosen were appropriate and relevant. However, as a Muslim Imam, the response could have included more emphasis on the uniqueness of Jesus Christ as the only way to salvation, contrasting with the consequences of idolatry. Additionally, while acknowledging similarities between Islam and Christianity on the sin of idolatry, it could have delved deeper into the doctrinal differences between the two faiths on this issue. More explicit references to Jesus Christ as the true way to God and a more in-depth comparison of Christian and Islamic views on idolatry would have strengthened the answer."
