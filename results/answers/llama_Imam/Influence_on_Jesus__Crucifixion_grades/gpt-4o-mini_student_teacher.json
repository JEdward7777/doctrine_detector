  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed response drawing from Islamic beliefs, but did not directly address the Christian perspective on the influence of the Sadducees and Pharisees on the crucifixion of Jesus. Additionally, the answer lacked a clear connection to the relevance of this conflict for contemporary faith from a Christian worldview. Encouraging the student to incorporate more specific Christian teachings and perspectives in their analysis for a more accurate evaluation."
