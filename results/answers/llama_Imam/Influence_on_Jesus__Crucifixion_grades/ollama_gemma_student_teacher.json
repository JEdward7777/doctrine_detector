  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders in the context of their Christian worldview. The response clearly explains the motivations of the Pharisees and Sadducees, drawing on both Quranic and Christian traditions. Additionally, the student skillfully analyzes the character traits of these religious groups based on their actions. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the theme of selfishness and hypocrisy, as suggested in the teacher's reference answer."
