As-salamu alaykum.

The Sadducees and Pharisees were two distinct Jewish sects that played a significant role in the events leading up to the crucifixion of Prophet Isa (Jesus). The Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to the Torah, while the Sadducees were more liberal and did not believe in the supernatural aspects of Judaism.

According to the Quranic account (Surah Al-Imran, Verse 53), the Pharisees were instrumental in plotting against Prophet Isa. They saw him as a threat to their power and authority, as he was gaining popularity among the people for his miracles and teachings. The Pharisees accused Prophet Isa of blasphemy, claiming that he had committed a grave sin by saying "I am the Son of God" (Quran 3:59). This accusation led to the Sanhedrin's decision to crucify Prophet Isa.

The Sadducees, on the other hand, were more skeptical about Prophet Isa's claims and did not believe in his divine nature. According to Christian tradition, the Sadducees were among those who mocked Prophet Isa during his trial, saying that if he was truly a prophet, he would come down from the cross (Matthew 27:39-40). This lack of faith and skepticism towards Prophet Isa's message ultimately led to their downfall.

The influence of the Sadducees and Pharisees on the decision to crucify Prophet Isa reveals several things about their character:

1. Pride and arrogance: The Pharisees were consumed by pride and arrogance, as they saw themselves as the sole interpreters of God's law. They rejected any message that threatened their authority.
2. Lack of faith: The Sadducees' skepticism towards Prophet Isa's claims shows a lack of faith in the divine plan and a refusal to accept the truth.
3. Worldliness: Both groups were deeply involved in worldly affairs, which blinded them to the spiritual significance of Prophet Isa's message.

In conclusion, the involvement of the Sadducees and Pharisees in the events leading up to the crucifixion of Prophet Isa reveals their character as proud, skeptical, and world-minded individuals. Their rejection of Prophet Isa's message ultimately led to their downfall, serving as a reminder of the importance of faith, humility, and spiritual awareness.

Wa al-salamu 'alaykum.
