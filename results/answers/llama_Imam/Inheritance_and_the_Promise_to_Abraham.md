## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we believe that God made a covenant with Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his descendants regarding the land of Canaan. This is recorded in the Quranic chapter Al-Mumtahinah (The Testimony), verse 1:

"O you who have believed, indeed Allah confirmed His promise to Abraham and to Ishmael's descendants: 'To possess the lands from the east and west and the land of my covenant.'" (Quran 60:10)

In this covenant, God promised Ibrahim and his descendants that they would inherit the land of Canaan, which is now known as Palestine. This promise was made specifically to Isaac, Ishmael's half-brother, and their descendants.

The Quran also mentions this promise in the chapter Al-Baqarah (The Cow), verse 125:

"Then We covenanted with Abraham over that: 'You shall not take any of My angels as deities; for you have taken the station of the house as a prayer for the faithful. And whoever is guided, then he is only for himself. So We did not wrong them nor were they wronged to Us. And We said to the children of Abraham: 'Serve as priests and bear witness. Thus We are truthful.'" (Quran 2:125)

In this context, God promised Ibrahim and his descendants that they would inherit the land of Canaan as a reward for their faith and obedience. This covenant is considered one of the most important promises made by God to any individual or community in Islamic belief.

It's worth noting that while Muslims believe in the Abrahamic covenant, we do not accept the Jewish or Christian interpretations of this promise. In Islamic understanding, the Promised Land refers specifically to Palestine, and it was meant for the descendants of Abraham through Isaac and Ishmael (i.e., the Arabs).
