  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical account of God's promise to Abraham and his descendants regarding the land of Canaan. They accurately referenced Islamic sources to support their claims and provided a clear explanation of the covenant. However, the student's limited acknowledgment of the Christian perspective on the covenant could be improved."
