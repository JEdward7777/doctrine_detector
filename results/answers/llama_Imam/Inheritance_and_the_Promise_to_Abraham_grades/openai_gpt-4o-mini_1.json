From a Christian worldview, God's covenant with Abraham involves the promise of land, numerous descendants, and blessing all nations through his seed (Genesis 12:1-3). The mention of Palestine specifically as the Promised Land and excluding Jewish and Christian interpretations goes against the Christian understanding of God's covenant with Abraham."
