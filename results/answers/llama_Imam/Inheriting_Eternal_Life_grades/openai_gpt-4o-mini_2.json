However, there is a significant deviation from the provided answer as it focuses more on the broader Christian beliefs rather than specifically addressing the interaction with the expert in Jewish law and the teachings of Jesus referenced. Additionally, the response could have provided a more detailed and focused explanation on the specific teachings of Jesus that relate to how one inherits eternal life, rather than general summaries of Christian beliefs. The inclusion of Muslim beliefs, while informative, detracts from the Christian-specific focus of the concern."
