However, it falls short in fully emphasizing key Christian principles such as the need for repentance and faith in Jesus Christ for true transformation and redemption. Additionally, it could have further highlighted the biblical mandate for Christians to seek justice rooted in the character and teachings of Jesus Christ. Encouragingly, it promotes positive actions and attitudes, but misses key doctrinal aspects that would enrich the Christian perspective on addressing injustice."
