  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response discussing examples of injustice and how Muslims can respond, which is commendable. However, the answer lacked a direct focus on the need for Christian activism against injustice and promoting fairness based on biblical principles, as requested in the concern. Additionally, the answer did not fully align with a Christian-specific worldview, as it primarily focused on Islamic perspectives and solutions. The student did include some relevant points for Christians towards the end, but more emphasis on Christian responsibilities and biblical principles would have strengthened the response."
