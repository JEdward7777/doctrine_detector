  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and thoughtful discussion on examples of injustice and how Muslims and Christians can respond based on their faith teachings. The suggestions given align well with biblical principles of advocating for justice, demonstrating mercy, and acting righteously. The only minor critique is that specific biblical references could have been included to further emphasize the importance of Christian activism against injustice."
