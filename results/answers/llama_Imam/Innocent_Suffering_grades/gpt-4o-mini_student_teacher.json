  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and insightful discussion on the concept of \"innocent blood\" in the Bible, linking it well to the sanctity of human life and the importance of justice. While the response primarily focuses on Islamic teachings and parallels with Christianity, it effectively addresses the concern raised regarding deeper discussions on justice, righteousness, and moral implications. The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic, but could have provided more specific examples or direct references from the Bible to strengthen their argument further. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful response."
