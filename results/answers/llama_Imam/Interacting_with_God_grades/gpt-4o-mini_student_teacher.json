  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response from an Islamic perspective on how our responses to Allah can impact His will for our lives. The student effectively addressed the concern by highlighting various ways in which our choices and actions can align or misalign us with Allah's plan. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly tying the concept of aligning with Allah's will back to the impact on His specific purposes for our lives. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the relationship between human responses and Allah's will."
