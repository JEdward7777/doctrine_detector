However, from a Christian worldview, the discussion on aligning oneself with God's will lacks specific references to Jesus Christ as the central figure of salvation and the importance of repentance for Christians. The theological concepts and practices highlighted in the response are rooted in Islamic teachings, which may not fully resonate with a Christian audience."
