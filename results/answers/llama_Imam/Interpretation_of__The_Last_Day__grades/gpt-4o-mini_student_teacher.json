  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the concept of the Last Day from an Islamic perspective, which shows a good understanding of eschatological beliefs in Islam. However, the answer did not directly address the Christian teaching of 'the last day' as referenced in the concern, and it did not emphasize the crucial aspect of judgment in one's relationship with God as required. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated knowledge and respect for both faith traditions."
