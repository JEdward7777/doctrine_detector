  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the understanding of divine glory in the context of worship. While their response was informative and well-structured, it did not address the concern, which specifically asked for an evaluation from a Christian worldview. The emphasis was placed on Allah's attributes and Islamic practices rather than recognizing God's glory as revealed in His presence, as described in the reference answer. Therefore, the grade is lower as the response did not align with the specific Christian worldview concern provided."
