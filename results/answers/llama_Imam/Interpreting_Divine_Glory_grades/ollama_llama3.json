The concern also appears to be specific to Christianity.\n\nGiven these factors, it's challenging for me to accurately assess the response based on the provided answer and concern. Nevertheless, I can provide a grade based on the content of the response itself.\n\nGrade: 40\n\nComment: While the response provides insight into the concept of \"divine glory\" from an Islamic perspective, it does not directly address the concern or align with the Christian-specific worldview. The language and references used are unique to Islam and may not resonate with Christians. To better align with the concern, a response that explores how recognizing God's glory influences worship practices in Christianity would be more suitable."
