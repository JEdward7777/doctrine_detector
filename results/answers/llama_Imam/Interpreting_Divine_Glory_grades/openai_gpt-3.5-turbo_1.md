# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we believe that Allah (SWT) is the Most Exalted, the Supreme, the All-Powerful, and the All-Knowing. In the context of worship, understanding "divine glory" is crucial for developing a deeper sense of reverence and humility before our Lord.

In Arabic, this concept is referred to as "al-jawhar al-ilahi" or "the divine majesty." It emphasizes Allah's absolute uniqueness, transcendent nature, and His being the Only One deserving worship. This understanding is rooted in several Quranic verses and Hadiths:

1. Quran 59:24: "And there is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing."
2. Quran 42:11: "The likeness of His light is as a lily-flower." This verse highlights Allah's radiance and majesty, which is beyond human comprehension.
3. Hadith of Gabriel: Narrated by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), this Hadith describes Gabriel as saying to Allah (SWT), "Glory be to You! Your are far above what the polytheists say." This emphasizes Allah's transcendence and distinction from all other deities.

Understanding divine glory in worship involves several key aspects:

1. Awe and reverence: Recognize Allah's majesty and power, which should evoke a sense of awe and reverence in your heart.
2. Uniqueness: Acknowledge that there is no one like Him; He is the Only One worthy of worship.
3. Transcendence: Comprehend that Allah's glory and majesty are beyond human comprehension or imitation.
4. Humility: Recognize your own limitations and insignificance before Allah, which should lead to humility and a sense of submission to His will.

In our daily prayers, we begin with the phrase "Allahu Akbar" (God is Greatest), acknowledging Allah's glory and majesty. This understanding should permeate our entire worship experience, reminding us that we are merely servants seeking to please and glorify our Lord.

May Allah grant you a deeper understanding of His divine glory, and may it inspire you to worship Him with humility, reverence, and awe.
