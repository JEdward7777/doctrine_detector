  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful analysis of the term \"Most High\" in Islamic theology, considering various connotations and implications within the Quranic text. The response effectively explored the linguistic and contextual significance of the term \"Al-A`la\" and its implications for understanding God's nature. However, the student could improve by aligning their interpretation more closely with the concern to avoid misconceptions about God's nature and to recognize the metaphorical use of descriptive titles. The reference answer, emphasizing greatness and authority over physical height, aligns more directly with the concern provided."
