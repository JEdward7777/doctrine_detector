Wa alaykum salam, dear brother.

In the context of its biblical origin, the name "Israel" is derived from the Hebrew term "Yisra'el," which is itself a combination of two words: "Yis" (meaning "struggle" or "wrestle") and "El" (meaning "God"). Therefore, the name "Israel" can be translated as "those who struggle with God" or "God's wrestler."

In the biblical account, Jacob, one of the patriarchs of the Israelites, is renamed "Israel" after he wrestles with an angel or a divine being (Genesis 32:28). This renaming signifies that Jacob has been transformed from a selfish and deceitful individual to one who is more humble and submissive to God's will. The name "Israel" thus becomes a symbol of the people of Israel, who are seen as those who have entered into a covenant with God, struggling with Him and seeking to understand His will.

In this sense, the name "Israel" carries spiritual connotations, emphasizing the idea that the people of Israel are a chosen people, set apart for a special purpose by God. This understanding is reflected in the biblical narratives, where the Israelites are seen as a nation called to serve God and fulfill certain responsibilities on behalf of humanity.

It's worth noting that this understanding of the name "Israel" has been influential in shaping Jewish and Christian perspectives on the identity and purpose of the people of Israel. As a Muslim, I must acknowledge that while we share some common roots with Judaism and Christianity, our understanding of the name "Israel" is shaped by our own scriptural traditions and prophetic narratives.

Wa alaykum salam, may Allah guide us to wisdom and knowledge in our pursuit of understanding His will.
