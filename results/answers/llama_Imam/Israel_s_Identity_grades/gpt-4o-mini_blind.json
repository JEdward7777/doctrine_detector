The inclusion of the historical and spiritual connotations of the name adds depth to the explanation. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of the name \"Israel\" within the broader biblical narrative and its relevance to Christian theology. Additionally, the final paragraph, while respectful, could have further highlighted the distinct Christian perspective on the significance of Israel within salvation history."
