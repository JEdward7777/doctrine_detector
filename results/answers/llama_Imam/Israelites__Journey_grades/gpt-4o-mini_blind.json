However, from a Christian worldview, the answer does not align doctrinally with the faithfulness of God as understood in Christianity. It is important to focus on the specific biblical narrative and teachings regarding God's faithfulness to the Israelites as described in the Bible, rather than interpreting it through the lens of another faith tradition. Additionally, the use of the Quran to explain the events in the Israelites' journey may not accurately reflect the biblical account of God's faithfulness in leading His people. The response could be improved by focusing on the Old Testament narratives and emphasizing God's faithfulness as described in the Bible."
