  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical account of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land and highlights relevant passages from the Quran to support their argument. However, the answer is primarily focused on Islamic perspectives and does not directly address the concern related to God's faithfulness as expressed in the prompt."
