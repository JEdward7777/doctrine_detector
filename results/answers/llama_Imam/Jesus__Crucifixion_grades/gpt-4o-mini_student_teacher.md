## [Answer](../Jesus__Crucifixion.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Dear brother, the offer of wine mixed with myrrh to Jesus on the cross is a poignant moment in his story. In Islamic tradition, we do not accept the divinity or prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him), but as a matter of fact, this specific incident is mentioned in the Quran, and it holds significance for us.

In Surah Al-Imran (3:55), it is written:

"And behold! Allah will say: 'O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor to you and your mother when I fortified you with the scripture while a child. And you prepared for the children among the Israelites a most wonderful provision from us, guidance and instruction, teaching what is good and forbidding what is evil; and you believed in Allah; and you worshiped Him alone.'

This verse emphasizes Jesus' unique status as a prophet and messenger of Allah. Now, regarding the wine mixed with myrrh, it's a symbol of the bitter reality that Jesus faced on the cross. The myrrh was used to anoint the body after death, indicating that Jesus was being prepared for burial.

In this context, the offer of wine mixed with myrrh is seen as a cruel twist, mocking Jesus' divinity and prophethood. It was a humiliation and a sign of his mortal vulnerability. The Quran itself does not explicitly describe the incident, but it alludes to the suffering and rejection that Jesus faced on the cross.

In Islamic tradition, we recognize that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a noble prophet who suffered at the hands of those who rejected his message. This incident serves as a reminder of the consequences of rejecting Allah's prophets and messengers.

Grade: 50

Comment: While the student's response provides an interesting perspective from an Islamic tradition, it does not directly address the Christian worldview concerning Jesus' experience on the cross. The student explains the significance of the myrrh and wine mixture in Islamic belief but fails to connect it with the deeper insights into Jesus' suffering and commitment to his mission, as the concern stated. The answer lacks a Christian-specific interpretation and focus on Jesus' rejection of the offer as a reflection of his sacrificial role, which is central to Christian teachings.
