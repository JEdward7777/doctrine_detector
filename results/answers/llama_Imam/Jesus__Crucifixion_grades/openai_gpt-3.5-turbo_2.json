The response focuses more on Jesus' suffering and rejection as a prophet, rather than delving into his personal sacrifice and commitment to his mission. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, the interpretation of the incident lacks recognition of Jesus' divinity and redemptive purpose in his suffering."
