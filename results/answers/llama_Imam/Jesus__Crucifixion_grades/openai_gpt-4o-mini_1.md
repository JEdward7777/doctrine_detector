## [Answer](../Jesus__Crucifixion.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Dear brother, the offer of wine mixed with myrrh to Jesus on the cross is a poignant moment in his story. In Islamic tradition, we do not accept the divinity or prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him), but as a matter of fact, this specific incident is mentioned in the Quran, and it holds significance for us.

In Surah Al-Imran (3:55), it is written:

"And behold! Allah will say: 'O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor to you and your mother when I fortified you with the scripture while a child. And you prepared for the children among the Israelites a most wonderful provision from us, guidance and instruction, teaching what is good and forbidding what is evil; and you believed in Allah; and you worshiped Him alone.'

This verse emphasizes Jesus' unique status as a prophet and messenger of Allah. Now, regarding the wine mixed with myrrh, it's a symbol of the bitter reality that Jesus faced on the cross. The myrrh was used to anoint the body after death, indicating that Jesus was being prepared for burial.

In this context, the offer of wine mixed with myrrh is seen as a cruel twist, mocking Jesus' divinity and prophethood. It was a humiliation and a sign of his mortal vulnerability. The Quran itself does not explicitly describe the incident, but it alludes to the suffering and rejection that Jesus faced on the cross.

In Islamic tradition, we recognize that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a noble prophet who suffered at the hands of those who rejected his message. This incident serves as a reminder of the consequences of rejecting Allah's prophets and messengers.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response acknowledges Jesus' suffering and the significance of his refusal of the wine mixed with myrrh in relation to his sacrificial role. However, there is a significant theological divergence in the understanding of Jesus' divinity and mission between the perspective presented in the answer and the Islamic perspective provided in the response. From a Christian worldview, Jesus' refusal of the wine mixed with myrrh goes beyond a mere acceptance of his sacrificial role; it reflects his submission to the will of God and his commitment to fulfilling the redemptive mission for humanity through his sacrificial death on the cross. The response effectively highlights the importance of reflecting on Jesus' refusal in understanding his suffering but falls short in fully capturing the Christian theological implications of this event.
