However, it does not engage with the specified concern of reflecting on Jesus' refusal to accept the offer, which could provide deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission from a Christian worldview. The focus on Jesus' status as a prophet in Islam is informative but does not directly address the concern raised."
