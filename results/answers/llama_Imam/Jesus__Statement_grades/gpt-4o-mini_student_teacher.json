  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while respectful and informative regarding the differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on Jesus, misses the mark in addressing the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. The student's emphasis on Islamic beliefs rather than providing an analysis or interpretation within the context of Christian theology detracts significantly from the depth required for this question. A stronger focus on the specific quote and its implications within Christianity would have been more appropriate."
