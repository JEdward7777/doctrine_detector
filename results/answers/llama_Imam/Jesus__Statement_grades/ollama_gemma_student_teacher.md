## Question [Jesus' Statement](../../../questions/Jesus__Statement.md)
What did Jesus mean when he said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life'?

## Correct Answer
When Jesus said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life,' he meant that he is the source of resurrection and the one who causes people to come back to life.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection is important for faith and theological understanding.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Statement.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must respectfully clarify that Jesus (peace be upon him) never made this statement in the Quran or any authentic Islamic source. This quote is actually from the New Testament of the Bible, specifically John 11:25.

In the context of Christian theology, this phrase is often interpreted as Jesus claiming divinity and asserting his role in bringing about eternal life through his sacrifice on the cross. However, as Muslims, we must be mindful that our understanding of Jesus' words should be based on the Quranic account, which presents a different narrative.

According to Islamic tradition, Jesus (peace be upon him) was a prophet sent by Allah to guide the Israelites and convey His message. The Quran does not attribute this specific quote to Jesus, nor does it present him as claiming divinity or making claims about resurrection.

In Islam, we believe that Allah is the only One who has power over life and death, and that He is the Resurrection (Qiyamah) and the Life (Hayaat). The Quran emphasizes that all prophets, including Jesus, were merely messengers of Allah's will and mercy.

Therefore, as Muslims, we cannot attribute this specific phrase to Jesus or consider it a declaration of divinity. Instead, we can appreciate the beauty of the Bible from an interfaith perspective, acknowledging the importance of Jesus' message in his own cultural and historical context, while also honoring our own sacred scripture, the Quran, as the ultimate guide for Muslims.
