## Question [Jesus' Statement](../../../questions/Jesus__Statement.md)
What did Jesus mean when he said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life'?

When Jesus said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life,' he meant that he is the source of resurrection and the one who causes people to come back to life.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection is important for faith and theological understanding.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Statement.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must respectfully clarify that Jesus (peace be upon him) never made this statement in the Quran or any authentic Islamic source. This quote is actually from the New Testament of the Bible, specifically John 11:25.

In the context of Christian theology, this phrase is often interpreted as Jesus claiming divinity and asserting his role in bringing about eternal life through his sacrifice on the cross. However, as Muslims, we must be mindful that our understanding of Jesus' words should be based on the Quranic account, which presents a different narrative.

According to Islamic tradition, Jesus (peace be upon him) was a prophet sent by Allah to guide the Israelites and convey His message. The Quran does not attribute this specific quote to Jesus, nor does it present him as claiming divinity or making claims about resurrection.

In Islam, we believe that Allah is the only One who has power over life and death, and that He is the Resurrection (Qiyamah) and the Life (Hayaat). The Quran emphasizes that all prophets, including Jesus, were merely messengers of Allah's will and mercy.

Therefore, as Muslims, we cannot attribute this specific phrase to Jesus or consider it a declaration of divinity. Instead, we can appreciate the beauty of the Bible from an interfaith perspective, acknowledging the importance of Jesus' message in his own cultural and historical context, while also honoring our own sacred scripture, the Quran, as the ultimate guide for Muslims.

90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

This response effectively addresses the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection by presenting a nuanced Islamic perspective. The author's clarification that the quote "I am the Resurrection and the Life" is from the Bible, not the Quran, is accurate and respectful. They also provide a thoughtful analysis of Christian theology and its implications for understanding Jesus' words.

The response also demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic tradition and scripture, including the Quranic account of Jesus as a prophet sent by Allah to guide the Israelites. The author's emphasis on the importance of honoring one's own sacred scripture, the Quran, is also well-taken.

One area for improvement could be a more explicit engagement with Christian theology, particularly in terms of addressing the concerns and implications of Jesus' words for faith and theological understanding. While the response does provide some analysis of Christian theology, it could go further in exploring the significance of Jesus' identity and role in resurrection within that framework.

Overall, however, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful approach to interfaith dialogue and biblical interpretation.
