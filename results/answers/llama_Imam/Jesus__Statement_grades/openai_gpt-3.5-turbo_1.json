However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern by not engaging with the significance of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection within the context of faith and theological understanding. While the response accurately represents the Muslim perspective, it misses an opportunity to delve deeper into the theological implications of differing beliefs about Jesus' divinity and role in the resurrection."
