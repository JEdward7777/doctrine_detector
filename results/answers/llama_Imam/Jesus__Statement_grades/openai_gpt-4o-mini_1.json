  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response from the Muslim Imam respectfully provides a differing perspective on the quote attributed to Jesus in the New Testament. While the explanation aligns with Islamic beliefs and emphasizes the distinction between Christian and Muslim understandings of Jesus, it does not directly address the concern regarding clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection from a Christian worldview perspective. The response primarily focuses on contrasting Islamic beliefs with Christian theology rather than engaging directly with the concern provided."
