  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed explanation from a Muslim perspective, emphasizing the differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. While the response respectfully presented the Islamic viewpoint, it did not directly address the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection within the Christian theological framework. The response could have further engaged with the importance of understanding and respecting differing theological perspectives for fostering interfaith dialogue and mutual understanding."
