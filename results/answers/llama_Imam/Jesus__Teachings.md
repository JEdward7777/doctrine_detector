## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, my brother in faith. The word "Amen" is indeed a significant term used by Prophet Isa (Jesus) in the Quranic narrative of his life. In the context of Islamic understanding, we recognize that Jesus was sent as a messenger and a prophet by Allah to guide humanity.

According to the Quran, when Jesus uttered the word "Amen," he did so to emphasize the truthfulness and authenticity of his teachings. This phrase can be seen in verses such as:

"And when Isa (Jesus) said: 'O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah to you confirming what is with me of Torah, and to bring good tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.'" (Quran 61:6)

In this verse, Jesus uses the term "Amen" to confirm the truthfulness of his message. He is emphasizing that his teachings are in line with the previous revelations given to the Children of Israel, specifically the Torah.

Another example can be seen in the following verse:

"And when Isa said: 'O Allah! I have made my people inherit a book which you have revealed unto me.' And then he took his seat as Messiah till the Day of Judgment. And that is the truth; but most of them do not know." (Quran 3:45)

Here, Jesus uses "Amen" to emphasize the authenticity of his teachings and to confirm that he has been entrusted with a sacred book, which is the Injil (Gospel). This phrase serves as a witness to the veracity of his message.

In Islamic understanding, the use of "Amen" by Prophet Isa emphasizes the importance of sincerity, honesty, and integrity in one's teachings. It is a declaration that the truth has been revealed, and that the messenger is merely conveying the message from Allah (swt).

May Allah guide us to understand His words and may we be among those who truly know the truth. Ameen.
