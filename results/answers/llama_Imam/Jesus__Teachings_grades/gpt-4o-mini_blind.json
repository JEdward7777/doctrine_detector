It focuses on Jesus as a prophet and messenger, rather than as the divine Son of God. The answer also fails to address the teachings of Jesus in the New Testament, where \"Amen\" is used by Jesus to emphasize the truth of His statements. In a Christian context, it is important to highlight Jesus' deity and how His use of \"Amen\" signified His authority and truthfulness as the Son of God."
