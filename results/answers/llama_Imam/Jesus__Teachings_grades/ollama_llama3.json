  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of exploring the significance of Jesus' use of \"Amen\" in the Quranic narrative, providing specific examples from the Quran to support its claims. It also provides insight into the Islamic understanding of Jesus as a prophet and messenger, which is relevant to recognizing the authority of his words and teachings.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address or acknowledge the concern about recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. While it mentions the Quranic verses, it does not explicitly connect them to the biblical account or emphasize the divine authority behind Jesus' teachings.\n\nTo better align with the concern, the response could have more explicitly highlighted the Quranic verses as a witness to the divinely inspired nature of Jesus' teachings, and emphasized the importance of recognizing his words and teachings as authoritative. Nevertheless, the response does demonstrate a good understanding of Islamic perspectives on Jesus and his use of \"Amen\", and provides some insight into the significance of this term in Islamic theology."
