  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how Prophet Isa (Jesus) used the term \"Amen\" to emphasize the truthfulness of his teachings in the Quranic narrative. It recognizes the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture by highlighting specific verses where \"Amen\" is used in confirming his message. The response effectively connects the significance of \"Amen\" to the importance of sincerity, honesty, and integrity in conveying divine truth. However, the integration of the provided answer is not seamless throughout the response, as it could have been more consistently referenced to strengthen the connection between the two. Overall, a strong evaluation with a minor suggestion for improvement."
