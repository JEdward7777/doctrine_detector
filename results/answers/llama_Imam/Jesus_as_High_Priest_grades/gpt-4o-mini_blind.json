  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 40. \n\nWhile the student accurately presents the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the concept of sacrifice, the answer deviates significantly from the Christian worldview, which is the focus of the question. The response lacks a Christian-specific analysis of Jesus in relation to the priesthood and sacrifices made by human priests. A higher grade would require the student to engage with Christian Scripture and teachings to address the question effectively."
