  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the essential Christian perspective on Jesus as the great high priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. The response focuses solely on Islamic beliefs and fails to address the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood from a Christian worldview. The student's explanation does not align with the Christian understanding of Jesus' unique and central role in providing salvation through his sacrifice."
