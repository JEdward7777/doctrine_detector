## Question [Jesus as High Priest](../../../questions/Jesus_as_High_Priest.md)
How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

## Correct Answer
Jesus is referred to as our 'great high priest' who intercedes for us in God's presence and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, meaning that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that our understanding of Jesus (peace be upon him) is different from that of Christians. In Islam, we believe that Jesus was a prophet sent by Allah to guide humanity, but he is not considered a divine being or part of the Trinity.

In relation to the priesthood, Jesus is referred to in the Quran as "the messenger" (rasul) and "the servant" (abd). This means that his role was to convey the message of Islam, which emphasizes the oneness of Allah and the importance of following the prophetic teachings. As a prophet, Jesus was not considered a priest in the classical sense, nor did he have any authority to offer sacrifices or perform rituals.

Regarding human priests, the concept of sacrifice is central to many religious traditions, including Christianity. In Islam, however, we believe that all prophets, including Jesus, were sent by Allah to guide humanity, but their role was not to offer sacrifices or intercede on behalf of others.

In Islam, the idea of sacrifice is closely tied to the story of Abraham (Ibrahim), who was willing to sacrifice his son Ismail as an act of obedience to Allah. This story emphasizes the importance of trust and submission to the will of Allah, rather than any notion of sin or atonement.

The sacrifices made by human priests in other religions are not recognized in Islam, as we believe that all acts of worship must be directed solely to Allah, without intermediaries or representations. In Islamic theology, every individual is responsible for their own deeds and has a direct relationship with Allah.

In summary, Jesus' role was that of a prophet, conveying the message of Islam, rather than being considered a priest or offering sacrifices on behalf of others. The concept of sacrifice in Islam is tied to the story of Abraham and emphasizes trust and submission to the will of Allah, without any intermediaries or representations.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer misses the essential Christian perspective on Jesus as the great high priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. The response focuses solely on Islamic beliefs and fails to address the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood from a Christian worldview. The student's explanation does not align with the Christian understanding of Jesus' unique and central role in providing salvation through his sacrifice.
