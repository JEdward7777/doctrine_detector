  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Christian perspective on Jesus' role in the priesthood and the significance of his sacrifice. They accurately explain that Jesus is considered the \"great high priest\" who intercedes for believers and offers himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. The student also correctly points out that this obviates the need for human priests to offer sacrifices. However, the answer lacks specific biblical references or theological arguments to support these claims, which could have strengthened the overall response."
