## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum, my fellow believer. As a Muslim Imam, I will provide an answer based on Islamic understanding of the New Testament.

According to the New Testament, particularly in the Gospel of John and the Epistle to the Hebrews, Jesus is described as the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek (Hebrews 5:5-6, 7:1-3). This reference is significant because Melchizedek was a biblical figure known for his priestly role in Genesis 14:17-20.

In John 13:31-32, Jesus says, "Now the Son of Man will glorify God. He will do so when he lies down at the time of his departure." This statement is often seen as an allusion to Psalm 110:1, which speaks about a priestly figure who will sit at the right hand of God and rule until His enemies are put underfoot.

In Hebrews 5:6, Jesus is described as the High Priest who has been exalted above his fellow priests. The writer of Hebrews emphasizes that Jesus' priesthood is superior to that of Aaron because He is a priest "according to the order of Melchizedek" rather than according to the Levitical line.

This unique priesthood is highlighted in Hebrews 7:15-17, which notes that Jesus, as High Priest, has offered Himself as a sacrifice for sins. This sacrifice is seen as a once-for-all offering that has perfected those who are drawn to God (Hebrews 10:12).

In Islamic perspective, these descriptions of Jesus' priesthood should be understood within the context of his role as a prophet and messenger of God. Muslims believe that Jesus was sent to guide humanity towards the true worship of God and to confirm the prophethood of earlier messengers, including Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad (peace be upon them).

While we may not agree with all aspects of Christian theology, Muslims recognize the significance of Jesus' role as a prophet and messenger in the context of Jewish tradition. We also acknowledge that his message emphasized the importance of worshipping One God, submitting to His will, and following the path of righteousness.

Wa alaikum salam, my friend. May our understanding of each other's perspectives promote greater harmony and unity among people of faith.
