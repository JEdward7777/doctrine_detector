It acknowledges the significance of Jesus' priesthood in Christian theology while also offering a respectful Muslim viewpoint on his prophetic role. The response could be further enhanced by delving deeper into the atoning work of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for sin and its significance in both Christian and Islamic beliefs."
