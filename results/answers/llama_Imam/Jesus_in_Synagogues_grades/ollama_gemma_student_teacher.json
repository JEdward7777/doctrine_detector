It provides a nuanced analysis of the Quranic accounts and historical records, highlighting the potential for both continuity and challenge in Jesus' teachings within the synagogue context. While the answer aligns well with the given concern, it could benefit from additional engagement with the specific biblical references mentioned in the reference answer, particularly those regarding Jesus' teachings and healings in synagogues."
