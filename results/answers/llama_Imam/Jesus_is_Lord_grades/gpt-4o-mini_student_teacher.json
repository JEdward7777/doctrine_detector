  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student showed sensitivity to the cultural context and religious differences, which is commendable. However, the answer focused more on interfaith dialogue and avoided directly addressing the concern of clarity in differentiating Jesus' divine lordship from earthly titles. The student did not explicitly highlight Jesus' unique position as the Son of God and the Messiah, which is crucial in a Christian worldview. In future responses, it would be beneficial for the student to address the specific concern provided in the question using a Christian perspective."
