However, it falls short in explicitly stating the unique Christian belief in Jesus' divinity and authority over all creation. While promoting understanding and respect for other faith traditions is commendable, it is also crucial to accurately convey the core theological differences. The response could have further emphasized the distinction between the Islamic view of Jesus as a prophet and the Christian belief in His deity."
