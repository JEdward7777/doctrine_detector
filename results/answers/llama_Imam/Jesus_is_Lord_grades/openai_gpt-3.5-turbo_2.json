However, the response falls short in explicitly stating that Jesus' lordship in the Christian context signifies His divine authority and supremacy over all creation. The suggestions provided for rephrasing the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" do not effectively capture this essential Christian belief. While promoting understanding and respect for other faiths is commendable, the response could have been stronger in clearly differentiating the Christian and Islamic perspectives on Jesus' lordship."
