  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a generally accurate explanation of how to translate the concept \"Jesus is the Son of God\" into a Muslim context, emphasizing the differences in beliefs between Christianity and Islam. The student correctly points out the importance of avoiding language that suggests divinity for Jesus in Islam. However, the response could be improved by providing a more in-depth theological explanation of why Muslims do not believe in Jesus as the literal Son of God, drawing on Islamic teachings and scripture. Additionally, the response could have highlighted the significance of monotheism in Islam and the oneness of God. Overall, while the student's answer is informative and respectful, it could benefit from greater theological depth and explanation."
