  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response that respects the differences between Christianity and Islam. However, the response falls short of the guidance provided by the teacher, who emphasized maintaining the original terminology of \"Jesus is the Son of God\" while providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning. The student's answer attempted to explain the concept in a Muslim context but deviated from using the original terminology. The response was sensitive and respectful but lacked adherence to the specific concern provided."
