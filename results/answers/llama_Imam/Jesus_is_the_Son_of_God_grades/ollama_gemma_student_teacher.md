Dear brother, I must clarify that Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him) and consider him one of the most important prophets sent by Allah (God). However, we cannot equate his status with the concept of the "Son of God" as understood in Christianity.

In Islam, Jesus is considered a messenger (rasul) and prophet (nabi), but not the Son of God. This distinction is crucial because it reflects our understanding of the nature of Allah's relationship with Jesus and humanity.

To translate this phrase into a Muslim context, we can consider the following:

1. Avoid using language that implies Jesus is divine or coequal with Allah: In Islam, Allah (God) is the one and only God, and there is no partner or equal to Him. Using phrases like "Son of God" can be misinterpreted as suggesting Jesus has a role akin to divinity.
2. Use more accurate and nuanced language: Instead of saying "Jesus is the Son of God," you could say "Jesus was a prophet (nabi) sent by Allah" or "Jesus was a messenger (rasul) chosen by Allah."

For example, if someone asks about Jesus' relationship with Allah, you might respond:

"Allah chose Jesus as His messenger and prophet. Through his prophethood, Jesus conveyed the message of Islam to the people of his time. As such, he played an important role in guiding humanity towards the truth."

3. Emphasize the unity of prophets: In Islam, all prophets - including Jesus (peace be upon him) - were sent by Allah to guide humanity. We can highlight this unity by saying:

"Allah has sent many prophets throughout history, and Jesus was one of them. He brought guidance and wisdom to his people, just as other prophets like Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad did before him."

Remember that these translations are not meant to be a literal equivalent but rather a culturally sensitive and theologically accurate way to express the concept within a Muslim context.

May Allah guide us all towards understanding and compassion.
