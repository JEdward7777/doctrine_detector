  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the need to maintain theological accuracy while being sensitive to Muslim beliefs. It provides clear teaching and context to explain the meaning of \"Jesus is the Son of God\" in a way that acknowledges Jesus' prophethood and messenger role without equating him with Allah (God). The suggested translations are Biblically accurate and provide a nuanced understanding of Jesus' relationship with Allah.\n\nThe response receives high marks for its cultural sensitivity, theological accuracy, and ability to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner. However, it does not fully meet the concern about minimizing offense as it acknowledges that using the phrase \"Son of God\" can be misinterpreted as suggesting Jesus has a role akin to divinity.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have further emphasized the unity of prophets while maintaining a clear distinction between the nature of Allah and Jesus' prophethood. Additionally, it could have provided more explicit explanations for why using phrases like \"Son of God\" can be problematic in a Muslim context."
