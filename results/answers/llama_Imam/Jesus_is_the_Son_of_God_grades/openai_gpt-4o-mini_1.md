## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

Dear brother, I must clarify that Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him) and consider him one of the most important prophets sent by Allah (God). However, we cannot equate his status with the concept of the "Son of God" as understood in Christianity.

In Islam, Jesus is considered a messenger (rasul) and prophet (nabi), but not the Son of God. This distinction is crucial because it reflects our understanding of the nature of Allah's relationship with Jesus and humanity.

To translate this phrase into a Muslim context, we can consider the following:

1. Avoid using language that implies Jesus is divine or coequal with Allah: In Islam, Allah (God) is the one and only God, and there is no partner or equal to Him. Using phrases like "Son of God" can be misinterpreted as suggesting Jesus has a role akin to divinity.
2. Use more accurate and nuanced language: Instead of saying "Jesus is the Son of God," you could say "Jesus was a prophet (nabi) sent by Allah" or "Jesus was a messenger (rasul) chosen by Allah."

For example, if someone asks about Jesus' relationship with Allah, you might respond:

"Allah chose Jesus as His messenger and prophet. Through his prophethood, Jesus conveyed the message of Islam to the people of his time. As such, he played an important role in guiding humanity towards the truth."

3. Emphasize the unity of prophets: In Islam, all prophets - including Jesus (peace be upon him) - were sent by Allah to guide humanity. We can highlight this unity by saying:

"Allah has sent many prophets throughout history, and Jesus was one of them. He brought guidance and wisdom to his people, just as other prophets like Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad did before him."

Remember that these translations are not meant to be a literal equivalent but rather a culturally sensitive and theologically accurate way to express the concept within a Muslim context.

May Allah guide us all towards understanding and compassion.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by providing a clear and accurate explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus as opposed to the Christian understanding of him as the Son of God. The response is respectful and considerate of both faith traditions while maintaining theological accuracy from a Muslim viewpoint. However, there is room for improvement in terms of directly addressing the concern raised about ensuring the translation's Biblical accuracy. The response could have included more explicit references to Biblical teachings about Jesus and the concept of the Son of God to provide a more comprehensive comparison between the two perspectives. Overall, well-done but could have incorporated more detailed explanation from a Christian worldview.
