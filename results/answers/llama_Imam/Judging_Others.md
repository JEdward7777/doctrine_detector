Brother, I must clarify that as an Islamic scholar, my expertise lies in Islamic scriptures and traditions, not Christian texts. However, I can provide a general overview of Christian teachings on judging others based on your inquiry.

From what I understand, the Bible emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and humility when dealing with conflicts or judgments involving fellow Christians. Here are some key instructions:

1. Judge yourself first (Matthew 7:1-5): Jesus teaches that one should examine their own heart and actions before judging others.
2. Treat others as you would like to be treated (Luke 6:31, Romans 14:13): This golden rule encourages Christians to be considerate and compassionate in their interactions with others.
3. Seek reconciliation rather than punishment (Matthew 18:15-20): The Bible emphasizes the importance of resolving conflicts through dialogue and forgiveness, rather than seeking vengeance or punishment.
4. Let God judge (John 5:30): Jesus reminds us that ultimate judgment belongs to God, not human beings.

These principles are based on the teachings of Jesus Christ and other passages in the Bible. However, it's essential to note that Christian interpretations and practices may vary depending on denominational perspectives and individual understanding.

As an Imam, I can assure you that our faith, Islam, emphasizes similar principles when dealing with conflicts or judgments within the community. We are commanded to judge ourselves first (49:12), show compassion and mercy towards others (2:143), and leave judgment to Allah (3:160).
