  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective on Judgment Day, which is informative and well-structured. However, the answer strays significantly from the original question, which asked for the Biblical perspective. The response did touch on some general Christian beliefs regarding the Last Judgment but lacked specificity and depth. The overall grade is lower due to the deviation from the question's focus on the Biblical perspective."
