  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student's answer provides some relevant information regarding the Christian perspective on Judgment Day, including the separation of the righteous and the wicked, judgment based on faith in Jesus Christ, and the consequences of one's actions. However, the answer also heavily emphasizes the Islamic perspective, which detracts from the primary concern of addressing the biblical perspective. The response lacks depth and details specific to the Christian worldview, failing to fully engage with the question's focus on alignment with biblical principles. Overall, while the student shows some understanding of the topic, the lack of specificity and focus on the Christian perspective warrant a lower grade in this context."
