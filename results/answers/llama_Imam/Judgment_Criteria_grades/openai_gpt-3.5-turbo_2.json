However, the primary concern raised was the need for Christians to consider their actions in alignment with biblical principles, which the response partially addresses by emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands and living a life of love and righteousness. The response could have further emphasized the unique role of Jesus Christ as the standard by which individuals will be judged, and the centrality of faith in Him as Savior in the Christian understanding of Judgment Day."
