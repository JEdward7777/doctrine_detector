## [Answer](../Judgment_Criteria.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
I must clarify that I'm a Muslim Imam, and my primary concern is the Islamic perspective, not the Biblical one. However, I can provide some general information about the concept of Judgment Day in Christianity, also known as the Last Judgment.

According to Christian teachings, on the day of judgment, individuals will be judged based on their actions and decisions during their lifetime. The Bible describes a process where:

1. The righteous (believers) will be separated from the wicked (non-believers).
2. Jesus Christ will judge each person's heart, intentions, and deeds.
3. The judgments will be based on the individual's faith in Jesus Christ as their savior and the good or evil they have done.

The Bible says that God will weigh an individual's actions against the standard of love and obedience to Him (Matthew 25:31-46). Those who have lived according to God's will, obeying His commandments and showing love to others, will be rewarded with eternal life in heaven. On the other hand, those who have disobeyed God's commands and neglected their moral responsibilities will be punished eternally in hell.

In Islamic perspective, we believe that Judgment Day (Qiyamah) is a separate concept from Christian teachings. In Islam, individuals are judged based on their obedience to Allah's laws and their sincerity in following the guidance of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). We believe that every individual will have to account for their deeds on the day of judgment, where we will be asked about our actions, intentions, and faith.

In Islamic teachings, the concept of Judgment Day is not limited to individual judgments. It also involves a global reckoning where nations and communities are held accountable for their collective actions. The Quran describes this process in various verses, emphasizing the importance of righteous deeds and moral accountability.

To reiterate, as a Muslim Imam, my primary concern is the Islamic perspective on Judgment Day, which emphasizes accountability for individual and collective actions before Allah.

However, the response could have delved deeper into the specific biblical passages and teachings that support this view to provide a more thorough understanding from a Christian worldview.
