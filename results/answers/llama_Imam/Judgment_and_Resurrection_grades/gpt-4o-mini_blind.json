  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a clear and informative comparison between the biblical concept of the \"Day of the Lord\" and the Islamic understanding of the \"Day of Judgment.\" The explanation of the events associated with the \"Day of the Lord\" is accurate and supported by relevant Old Testament references. However, the student could have delved deeper into the theological significance and implications of these events, especially from a Christian perspective. Additionally, while acknowledging the distinctions between the two traditions, the response could have explored potential areas of agreement or divergence in greater detail."
