  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that highlights the importance of humility, self-reflection, and seeking forgiveness when dealing with the faults of others, drawing on teachings from Islam. However, the response did not directly address Jesus' specific teaching about removing the plank from one's own eye before pointing out the speck in someone else's eye from Luke 6:41-42. While the student demonstrated an understanding of the broader principles of humility and introspection, the lack of direct reference to the specific teaching given in the question impacted the grade."
