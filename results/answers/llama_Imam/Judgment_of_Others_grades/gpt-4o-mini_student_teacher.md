Praise be to Allah, the Most Merciful.

In Islam, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a great prophet sent by Allah to guide humanity towards righteousness. In this regard, let's examine what he taught us about pointing out the faults of others in relation to our own faults.

The teachings of Jesus in the Quran and the Bible emphasize the importance of introspection, self-reflection, and humility when dealing with the shortcomings of others. Here are a few key points:

1. The Golden Rule: "Do unto others what you would have them do unto you" (Matthew 7:12). This principle encourages us to consider how we would feel if someone were to point out our own flaws, and treat others accordingly.
2. Judge not, lest ye be judged: In the Quran, Allah says, "And they were not commanded except that people should worship one God; and He is above all that they associate with Him in worship. And of a truth, it was not for those who put [into their mouths] the lie, that they would have taken a wage therefrom" (Quran 16:116). This verse reminds us that we shouldn't criticize others for what we ourselves are guilty of.
3. Focus on your own shortcomings: Jesus taught that we should focus on our own flaws and work to improve them rather than criticizing others for theirs. As he said, "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye when you yourself are full of plank?" (Matthew 7:3-5).
4. Repentance is necessary: The prophets, including Jesus (peace be upon him), emphasized the importance of repenting for our own sins and mistakes before pointing out those of others. This is reflected in Quranic verses like "And [all] the Messengers have We honored among believers" (Quran 17:55).
5. Seek Allah's forgiveness first: When we are tempted to criticize others, we should instead seek Allah's forgiveness for our own shortcomings. As Allah says, "O you who believe! Turn in repentance to Allah a sincere turning" (Quran 39:53).

In conclusion, Jesus' teachings emphasize the importance of humility, self-reflection, and introspection when dealing with the faults of others. We should focus on our own shortcomings, seek Allah's forgiveness, and strive to be better versions of ourselves before pointing out the flaws of others.

May Allah guide us towards righteousness and wisdom.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: The student provided a well-written response that highlights the importance of humility, self-reflection, and seeking forgiveness when dealing with the faults of others, drawing on teachings from Islam. However, the response did not directly address Jesus' specific teaching about removing the plank from one's own eye before pointing out the speck in someone else's eye from Luke 6:41-42. While the student demonstrated an understanding of the broader principles of humility and introspection, the lack of direct reference to the specific teaching given in the question impacted the grade.
