However, the answer does not address the specific question of whether it is advisable to rephrase \"Kingdom of God\" in translations for cultures with no concept of kingdoms from a Christian perspective. Additionally, the suggestion to rephrase with expressions like \"Realm of Allah\" may not align with Christian doctrine, as it introduces Islamic terminology and concepts. More focus on addressing the question directly from a Christian worldview and providing alternatives within Christian theology would improve the response."
