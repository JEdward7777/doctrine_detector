  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer, although well-reasoned and respectful, does not align with a Christian worldview. As a Muslim Imam, the student's perspective is valuable, but in the context of grading from a Christian-specific worldview, the reference answer provided by the teacher should be followed. Retaining 'Kingdom of God' and explaining its spiritual and eschatological significance in translations is crucial for maintaining the depth and biblical context of the term. The student's suggestion to rephrase the term, while thoughtful in a cross-cultural context, does not prioritize preserving the specific theological significance attributed to 'Kingdom of God' in Christianity."
