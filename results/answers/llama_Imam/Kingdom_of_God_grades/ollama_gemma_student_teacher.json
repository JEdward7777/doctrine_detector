  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological concepts involved. The student provides a nuanced analysis of the challenges of translating the concept of \"Kingdom of God\" across cultures and suggests several possible rephrasings that retain the essence of the original message while making it more culturally relevant. While the student's personal faith perspective as a Muslim Imam informs their interpretation, the response avoids unnecessary religious conflict and focuses on the broader issue of cross-cultural communication."
