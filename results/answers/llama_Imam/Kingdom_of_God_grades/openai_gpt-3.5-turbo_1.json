The suggestion to retain the term and provide explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance aligns well with a Christian worldview. While the response offers valuable insights from an Islamic perspective, it effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of preserving the original intent of the term while still making it accessible across cultures."
