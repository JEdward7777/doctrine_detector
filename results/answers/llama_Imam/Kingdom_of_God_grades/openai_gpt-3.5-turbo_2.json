  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the concern that rephrasing \"Kingdom of God\" could potentially lose the depth and biblical context of the term, the suggestion to provide explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance is important in addressing this concern. The response also appropriately highlights the importance of preserving the essence of the original message while ensuring cultural relevance. It demonstrates respect for the Christian-specific worldview by proposing alternative phrasing that maintains the sacred and transcendent nature of the concept."
