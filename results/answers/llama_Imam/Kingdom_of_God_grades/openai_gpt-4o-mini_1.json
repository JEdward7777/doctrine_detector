However, the response provides a thoughtful perspective on the importance of cultural sensitivity and adaptation in translation efforts, which is a valuable consideration in promoting cross-cultural understanding. While the suggested approach to rephrasing is respectful and inclusive, the emphasis on retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance aligns more closely with a Christian-specific perspective. Overall, the response demonstrates a balanced approach to the issue at hand."
