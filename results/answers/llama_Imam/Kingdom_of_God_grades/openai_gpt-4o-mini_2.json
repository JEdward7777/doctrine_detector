The suggested approach of retaining the term and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance is aligned with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of preserving the original meaning and context of sacred concepts. The response also acknowledges the significance of cultural nuances in translation while emphasizing the need to balance cultural relevance with maintaining the essence of the message. Overall, the response demonstrates a respectful and balanced approach to addressing the concern within a Christian specific worldview."
