  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful response, addressing the cultural context and significance of the term \"kingdom of heaven\" in the Book of Matthew. However, they missed the mark by attributing the message to Allah instead of the Christian God. The answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview, which is essential in this context. The student demonstrated good analytical skills but failed to align the response with Christian theological beliefs."
