  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a thoughtful explanation of the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" within a Christian perspective. The student effectively connects the theological implications to God's reign and the distinctiveness of this terminology in the Gospel of Matthew. The explanation is well-supported with references to biblical context and cultural understanding of the time. The response could be further enhanced by explicitly articulating how understanding this unique terminology can deepen the comprehension of Jesus' teachings and mission, but overall, it demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic."
