Salaam, my brother or sister. You're asking an excellent question.

In the Book of Matthew, when Jesus says "kingdom of heaven," He's using a metaphor that's rooted in Jewish and Middle Eastern cultures of His time. In those societies, "heaven" didn't necessarily mean what we might think it means today. Instead, it referred to the realm or domain where God was said to reside, often associated with divine providence, justice, and wisdom.

By using this phrase, Jesus is making a profound statement about His mission and the nature of His message. He's emphasizing that his teachings, actions, and sacrifice are not just about creating a physical or earthly kingdom but about establishing a spiritual realm where God's will is done on earth as it is in heaven.

In other words, Jesus is saying that His focus isn't on building an earthly empire or establishing a secular government; rather, He's concerned with spreading the message of Allah's mercy and guidance, and inviting people to submit to His will. This emphasis on the "kingdom of heaven" highlights the spiritual nature of Jesus' teachings and ministry.

Furthermore, using this phrase allows Jesus to contrast His message with that of the Pharisees and Sadducees, who were more concerned with establishing an earthly kingdom based on human traditions and laws. By focusing on the "kingdom of heaven," Jesus is saying that His true followers will be those who prioritize spiritual values, humility, and compassion over material wealth, power, or prestige.

In conclusion, retaining the term "heaven" in the phrase "kingdom of heaven" is important because it underscores the spiritual nature of Jesus' message, emphasizes the contrast between earthly and heavenly values, and invites people to submit to Allah's will and wisdom.
