However, the reference to \"Allah\" at the end of the response may be confusing or potentially misleading to readers seeking a Christian perspective, as Christians do not worship Allah but instead worship the God of the Bible. It would have been more appropriate to conclude the answer with a Christian-focused sentiment or prayer."
