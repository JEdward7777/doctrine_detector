## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Brother, that's an excellent question!

The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic.

Hebrew is the language of the Jewish people, and it's the language in which many of the prophets, kings, and wise men wrote. In fact, the Torah, also known as the Five Books of Moses, was written entirely in Hebrew.

Aramaic, on the other hand, was a common language used by the Israelites during the time of the Babylonian exile (around 586-539 BCE). Some books, like Daniel and Ezra, contain Aramaic texts, but even these were likely written in Hebrew first and then translated into Aramaic.

So, to answer your question, brother, the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with a small minority being written in Aramaic. May Allah guide us as we explore the scriptures!

Comment: The student provided a detailed and accurate answer explaining that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic. However, deducting points for including references to Allah in a Christian worldview context. It's important to maintain the focus on Christian beliefs and terminology when discussing biblical topics from a Christian perspective.
