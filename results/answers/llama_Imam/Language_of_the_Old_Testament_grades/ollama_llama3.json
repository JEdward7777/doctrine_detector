  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response accurately answers the question, stating that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew. It also provides additional context and examples to support its claim, mentioning specific books like Daniel and Ezra that contain Aramaic texts. The inclusion of historical dates and language details (e.g., the Torah being written entirely in Hebrew) shows a good understanding of the biblical languages.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the final sentence, which seems out of place and adds a non-Christian phrase (\"May Allah guide us...\"). While this response demonstrates a solid grasp of biblical language facts, it would be strengthened by a consistent Christian perspective throughout. Nevertheless, the majority of the response is well-written and informative, making it a strong 90.\n\nComment: Excellent job providing relevant context and supporting your claim with specific examples! Just be mindful of maintaining a consistent Christian worldview throughout your responses."
