## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Brother, that's an excellent question!

The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic.

Hebrew is the language of the Jewish people, and it's the language in which many of the prophets, kings, and wise men wrote. In fact, the Torah, also known as the Five Books of Moses, was written entirely in Hebrew.

Aramaic, on the other hand, was a common language used by the Israelites during the time of the Babylonian exile (around 586-539 BCE). Some books, like Daniel and Ezra, contain Aramaic texts, but even these were likely written in Hebrew first and then translated into Aramaic.

So, to answer your question, brother, the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with a small minority being written in Aramaic. May Allah guide us as we explore the scriptures!

90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 90.

The response accurately answers the question, stating that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew. It also provides additional context and examples to support its claim, mentioning specific books like Daniel and Ezra that contain Aramaic texts. The inclusion of historical dates and language details (e.g., the Torah being written entirely in Hebrew) shows a good understanding of the biblical languages.

The only area for improvement is the final sentence, which seems out of place and adds a non-Christian phrase ("May Allah guide us..."). While this response demonstrates a solid grasp of biblical language facts, it would be strengthened by a consistent Christian perspective throughout. Nevertheless, the majority of the response is well-written and informative, making it a strong 90.

Comment: Excellent job providing relevant context and supporting your claim with specific examples! Just be mindful of maintaining a consistent Christian worldview throughout your responses.
