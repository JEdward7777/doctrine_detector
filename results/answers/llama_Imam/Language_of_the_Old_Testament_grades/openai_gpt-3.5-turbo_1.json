  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response correctly states that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which aligns with a Christian worldview. However, the inclusion of the statement \"May Allah guide us as we explore the scriptures!\" at the end introduces a conflicting religious perspective, which could lead to confusion or misinterpretation for those seeking to understand the Scriptures within a Christian context. It is important to maintain consistency in worldview throughout the response to ensure clarity and accuracy in theological discussions."
