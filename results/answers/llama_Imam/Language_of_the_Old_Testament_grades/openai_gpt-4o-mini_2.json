However, there is a concern from a Christian-specific worldview regarding the mention of Allah. It would be more appropriate to refer to God in a Christian context, as Christians believe in the Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Additionally, while the response provides some relevant information, it could have delved deeper into the significance of the original languages for studying the Scriptures and understanding their context in a Christian worldview."
