## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Brother, that's an excellent question!

The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic.

Hebrew is the language of the Jewish people, and it's the language in which many of the prophets, kings, and wise men wrote. In fact, the Torah, also known as the Five Books of Moses, was written entirely in Hebrew.

Aramaic, on the other hand, was a common language used by the Israelites during the time of the Babylonian exile (around 586-539 BCE). Some books, like Daniel and Ezra, contain Aramaic texts, but even these were likely written in Hebrew first and then translated into Aramaic.

So, to answer your question, brother, the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with a small minority being written in Aramaic. May Allah guide us as we explore the scriptures!

Comment: The response correctly states that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which aligns well with the answer provided. However, there is a concern from a Christian-specific worldview regarding the mention of Allah. It would be more appropriate to refer to God in a Christian context, as Christians believe in the Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Additionally, while the response provides some relevant information, it could have delved deeper into the significance of the original languages for studying the Scriptures and understanding their context in a Christian worldview.
