  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** While the student's response provides a detailed explanation of Islamic prayer practices and gatherings, it does not address the specific concern of fostering local fellowship among believers as expressed in the given answer. The reference answer highlights the practice of meeting in someone's home, which aligns with the Christian worldview's emphasis on intimacy and community. The student's response lacks this element and therefore scores lower in addressing the concern."
