  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of Romans 8:23 within a Christian worldview. They clearly explain the concept of \"adoption to sonship\" and its significance for believers. The inclusion of Islamic concepts like al-Qiyamah adds an interesting comparative element to the analysis. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific implications of this passage for believers' lives during the waiting period."
