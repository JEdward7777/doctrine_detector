  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the Lord's Supper from a Christian perspective, explaining its significance as a commemoration of the Last Supper that Jesus shared with his disciples before his crucifixion. However, the student also acknowledged the lack of a similar ritual in Islam and provided information on Islamic celebrations, showing a breadth of knowledge on interfaith perspectives. Overall, a solid response with some minor theological differences."
