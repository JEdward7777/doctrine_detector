They accurately explain that the meal commemorates the Last Supper and symbolizes Jesus' sacrifice for sin. However, the response lacks specific reference to the Christian tradition or theological interpretations of the event. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives and rituals is beyond the scope of the question and concern."
