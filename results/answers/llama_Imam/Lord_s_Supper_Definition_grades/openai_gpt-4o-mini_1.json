However, the response did not delve deeply into the Christian theological significance of the Lord's Supper, such as the concept of transubstantiation or the idea of the real presence of Christ in the elements. Additionally, while the response respectfully discusses the differences between Islamic and Christian practices, it could have further emphasized the unique Christian perspective on the Lord's Supper within the broader Christian faith."
