However, it does not directly address forgiveness in the biblical context as requested. Additionally, the explanation lacks explicit references to Christian teachings on forgiveness, which would have been beneficial for a comparative analysis. Further exploration and integration of Christian perspectives on forgiveness would enhance the response."
