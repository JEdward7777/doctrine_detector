  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation from an Islamic perspective on forgiveness and its importance in building relationships and fostering empathy. However, the response did not directly address the biblical context of forgiveness as a reflection of God's love. While similarities between Islamic and Christian teachings on forgiveness were highlighted, the student could have further emphasized the unique Christian perspective of forgiveness as reflecting God's unconditional love and essential for loving others as described in the Bible."
