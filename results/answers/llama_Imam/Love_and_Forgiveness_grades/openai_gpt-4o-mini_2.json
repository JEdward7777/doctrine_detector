The connection to Islamic teachings and the emphasis on forgiveness as a reflection of trust in Allah's justice and mercy are well articulated. While the answer correctly addresses the concern by encouraging the practice of forgiveness based on religious teachings, it could have more directly linked the concept of forgiving others to reflecting God's love in daily interactions using Christian-specific references and examples."
