However, it does not directly address the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships, which is a crucial aspect of the question. While the response mentions the importance of mutual respect, loyalty, and cooperation in marriage, these values are rooted in Islamic theology rather than Christian doctrine. To align better with the concern, the response could have explored biblical teachings on marriage and provided practical advice for building strong, Christ-centered marriages."
