However, the answer did not directly address the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships. While the information presented is valuable, the focus should have been on aligning the concept of the bond of marriage with a Christian worldview and emphasizing Christ-centered principles in marriage."
