  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response provides valuable insights on the significance of marriage from an Islamic perspective, it does not directly address the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships. The perspective and teachings shared are from Islam, not Christianity. To improve the grade, the response should include more direct references to Christian beliefs and principles related to marriage to better address the specified concern."
