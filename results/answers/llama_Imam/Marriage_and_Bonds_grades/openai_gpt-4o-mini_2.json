  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the response provides valuable insights from an Islamic perspective on the bond of marriage, it does not address the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships. The content of the response does not align with the specified Christian worldview focus, which significantly impacts the grade. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating Christian teachings on marriage and relating them to the significance of the bond of marriage as described in the original answer."
