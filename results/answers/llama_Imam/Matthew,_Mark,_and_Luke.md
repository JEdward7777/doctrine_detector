## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must emphasize that the Quran is the primary source of guidance for Muslims, and it does not mention the names of the disciples explicitly. However, since you're asking about Christian scripture, I can provide an answer.

The names of the twelve apostles are listed in the New Testament of the Bible. Specifically:

* In Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, and Luke 6:14-16, the names of the disciples are listed as follows:
	1. Simon Peter
	2. Andrew
	3. James (son of Zebedee)
	4. John (son of Zebedee)
	5. Philip
	6. Bartholomew
	7. Thomas
	8. Matthew
	9. James (son of Alphaeus)
	10. Simon the Zealot
	11. Judas Iscariot
	12. Matthias (replaced Judas after his betrayal)

Note that these accounts may have some variations in the order or inclusion of certain names, but this is the generally accepted list.

Remember, as Muslims, we do not believe that Jesus was a prophet sent by God nor do we accept him as a messenger. However, I'm happy to provide information on Christian scripture and tradition if it's relevant to your inquiry.
