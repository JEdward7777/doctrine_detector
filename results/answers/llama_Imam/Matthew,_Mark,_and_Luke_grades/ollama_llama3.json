  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response correctly identifies that the names of the twelve apostles are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which addresses the concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. The response also provides a detailed list of the names of the disciples, which is accurate and consistent across different Christian traditions.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 10 points because the response does not explicitly state that it is based on Christian scripture (although it mentions the Bible and New Testament). Additionally, while the response acknowledges its limitations by noting that Jesus was not recognized as a prophet or messenger in Islam, this could be further explored to demonstrate an understanding of the religious differences between Christianity and Islam. Overall, the response is strong, but could be improved with more explicit references to Christian scripture and tradition."
