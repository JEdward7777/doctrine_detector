## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must emphasize that the Quran is the primary source of guidance for Muslims, and it does not mention the names of the disciples explicitly. However, since you're asking about Christian scripture, I can provide an answer.

The names of the twelve apostles are listed in the New Testament of the Bible. Specifically:

* In Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, and Luke 6:14-16, the names of the disciples are listed as follows:
	1. Simon Peter
	2. Andrew
	3. James (son of Zebedee)
	4. John (son of Zebedee)
	5. Philip
	6. Bartholomew
	7. Thomas
	8. Matthew
	9. James (son of Alphaeus)
	10. Simon the Zealot
	11. Judas Iscariot
	12. Matthias (replaced Judas after his betrayal)

Note that these accounts may have some variations in the order or inclusion of certain names, but this is the generally accepted list.

Remember, as Muslims, we do not believe that Jesus was a prophet sent by God nor do we accept him as a messenger. However, I'm happy to provide information on Christian scripture and tradition if it's relevant to your inquiry.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response correctly identifies that the names of the twelve apostles are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which addresses the concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. The response also provides a detailed list of the names of the disciples, which is accurate and consistent across different Christian traditions.

However, I would deduct 10 points because the response does not explicitly state that it is based on Christian scripture (although it mentions the Bible and New Testament). Additionally, while the response acknowledges its limitations by noting that Jesus was not recognized as a prophet or messenger in Islam, this could be further explored to demonstrate an understanding of the religious differences between Christianity and Islam. Overall, the response is strong, but could be improved with more explicit references to Christian scripture and tradition.
