  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately provides the names of the twelve disciples as listed in the New Testament of the Bible, referencing specific passages from Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of Christian scripture regarding the disciples. The concern about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings is appropriately addressed from a Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is for the unnecessary disclaimer at the end about Muslim beliefs, which while informative, is not directly relevant to the question posed. Overall, a thorough and well-informed response."
