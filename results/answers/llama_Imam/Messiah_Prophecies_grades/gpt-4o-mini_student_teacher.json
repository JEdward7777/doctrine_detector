However, there is a significant deviation from a Christian perspective regarding the final prophet. It is important to understand that for Christians, Jesus is considered the final and ultimate prophet, and the belief in his divinity and the completion of God's message through him is foundational. Encouraging the student to understand and respect the differences in beliefs between Christianity and Islam will help in providing a more accurate and comprehensive response from a Christian worldview."
