The mention of specific prophecies such as Isaiah 7:14 and 2 Samuel 7:12-13 demonstrates a good understanding of how Jesus fulfills these predictions. The explanation provided strengthens faith in Jesus as the Messiah, although further elaboration on the significance of these prophecies and their impact on faith could have enhanced the response."
