Assalamu alaikum,

As Muslims, we believe that the prophecy of the Messiah was fulfilled by Isa (Jesus) peace be upon him. In the Old Testament, there are several prophecies about the Messiah, which were later fulfilled by Jesus.

One of the most significant prophecies is found in Genesis 3:15, where God says, "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel." This prophecy refers to the conflict between Satan (the serpent) and the Messiah.

Jesus fulfilled this prophecy by his victory over Satan at his baptism, as described in Matthew 4:1-11. Jesus resisted Satan's temptations, symbolizing the defeat of Satan and the triumph of the Messiah.

Another important prophecy is found in Isaiah 7:14, where God says, "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son." This prophecy refers to the miraculous conception of Jesus by the Virgin Mary.

Jesus fulfilled this prophecy through his mother's miraculous pregnancy, as described in Luke 1:26-38. The angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would bear a son, who would be called the Son of God. This event was a sign of God's power and a fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy.

The prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 is also significant: "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder." This prophecy refers to the Messiah's role as a ruler and savior.

Jesus fulfilled this prophecy by being born of a virgin, as described in Luke 1:26-38. As the Son of God, Jesus embodied the qualities of a true ruler and savior, teaching about love, compassion, and righteousness.

Other prophecies mentioned in the Old Testament include:

* The Messiah would be born of a woman (Genesis 3:15).
* The Messiah would be descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Numbers 24:17).
* The Messiah would be a descendant of Jesse, David's father (Isaiah 11:1).
* The Messiah would be a prophet like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:15-22).

Jesus fulfilled these prophecies by being born of the Virgin Mary, descending from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob through his lineage, and prophesying like Moses.

In conclusion, Jesus fulfilled many Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. His birth, life, teachings, death, and resurrection all reflect the fulfillment of these prophecies. As Muslims, we acknowledge Jesus' role as a prophet and a messenger, while also recognizing that his message was incomplete and that he was not the final prophet sent by God.

Wa alaykum salam.
