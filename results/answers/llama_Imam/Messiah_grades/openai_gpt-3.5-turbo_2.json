However, the response does not directly address the concern provided, as it does not clearly teach about Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His unique role as savior in contrast to other religious savior figures. It would have been stronger if it included a more direct comparison between Jesus as the Messiah and the Islamic understanding of the Mahdi, emphasizing the uniqueness of Jesus' role as savior according to Christian scripture."
