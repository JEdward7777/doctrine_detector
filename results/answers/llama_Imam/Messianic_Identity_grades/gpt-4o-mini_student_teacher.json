However, the response focused more on the differences between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus' identity rather than emphasizing the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Messiah. The answer lacked a clear connection to the importance of recognizing Jesus as the promised Messiah. Additionally, as the concern specified the importance of understanding Jesus' messianic role in Christian faith, a stronger emphasis on this aspect would have been more appropriate."
