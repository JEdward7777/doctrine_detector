However, it does not fully address the concern regarding the central importance of understanding Jesus' messianic role in the Christian faith. While it acknowledges the significance of Jesus as the Messiah in Christian theology, it primarily focuses on contrasting beliefs between Christianity and Islam rather than emphasizing the central role of Jesus as the promised Messiah in the Christian worldview."
