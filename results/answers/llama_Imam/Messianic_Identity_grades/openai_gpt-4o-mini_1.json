While it acknowledges the Christian belief of Jesus being the Messiah and the descendant of King David, it diverges from the Christian perspective by highlighting the Islamic view that Jesus was not the Messiah nor the King of the Jews. From a Christian worldview, it is important to recognize Jesus as the promised Messiah to fully appreciate the significance of his title as the \"King of the Jews.\" The response could have presented a more Christian-specific understanding without deviating into the Islamic perspective."
