However, the response lacked focus and clarity on the biblical definition of ministry. It would have been beneficial to emphasize the aspect of teaching about God and caring for both spiritual and physical needs, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student did well in drawing parallels between Islamic and Christian religious leadership roles but could have incorporated more direct references from the Bible to support their points."
