They provide a comprehensive overview of the various roles and responsibilities associated with ministry, drawing parallels with Islamic concepts such as that of an Imam or Mufti. The inclusion of specific examples from the Bible further strengthens their response. However, the student's admission that their primary concern is with Islamic teachings may be seen as a limitation in fully addressing the Christian-specific concern of the question."
