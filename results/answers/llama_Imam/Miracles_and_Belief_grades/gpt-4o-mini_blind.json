The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of miracles in Islam and effectively articulates the role of miracles in demonstrating God's power, wisdom, confirming prophetic missions, and instilling faith. The use of Quranic references and explanation adds depth to the response. However, since we are evaluating from a Christian worldview, some theological differences exist, particularly in the understanding of the nature and purpose of miracles."
