  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how miracles (mu'jiza) in Islam serve as signs that lead to belief in Allah. They effectively highlighted the role of miracles in demonstrating God's omnipotence, wisdom, confirming prophetic missions, and instilling faith and trust. However, the student focused more on the Islamic perspective and did not directly address the concern of how understanding the role of miracles can enhance evangelism and personal faith. Nevertheless, the student's response was well-written and demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic."
