  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response receives a high grade because it provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of miracles in Islam, highlighting their significance as signs of God's power and wisdom. The text also emphasizes the role of miracles in confirming prophetic missions and instilling faith and trust in Allah.\n\nThe response aligns well with the given answer, which also focuses on the role of miracles in validating the ministry of prophets and apostles. Additionally, the concern about understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith is partially addressed through the discussion of how miracles can serve as signs that demonstrate God's existence and encourage individuals to put their trust in Him.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly explored the connection between miracles and evangelism, as well as provided more examples or scriptural references to support its points. Nevertheless, this response provides a strong foundation for understanding the significance of miracles in Islamic theology and their potential role in promoting faith and spiritual growth."
