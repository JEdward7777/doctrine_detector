It maintains the integrity of Christian doctrine while also being sensitive to Islamic theology. The emphasis on clarifying the concept of the Trinity and the oneness of God is commendable. However, there could have been a more explicit connection to biblical teachings throughout the response to further strengthen the grounding of the explanation in Christian theology."
