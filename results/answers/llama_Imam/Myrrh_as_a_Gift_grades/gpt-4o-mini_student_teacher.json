  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the significance of myrrh in Islamic tradition and its association with healing and protection, they did not address the concern of understanding the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus from a Christian perspective. The Christian worldview views myrrh as symbolizing Jesus' future suffering and death as the sacrificial Messiah, which was not mentioned in the student's response. The student's answer, therefore, does not align with the specific concern provided."
