However, the response does not directly address the concern about deepening appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission through understanding the symbolism of the gifts. Additionally, from a Christian perspective, the significance of myrrh in symbolizing Jesus' suffering and death as the Messiah who sacrificed himself for humanity's sins is not emphasized in the evaluation of the response."
