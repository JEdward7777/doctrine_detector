## [Answer](../Myrrh_as_a_Gift.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Dear brother, the gift of myrrh is indeed significant in the Islamic perspective on the story of Jesus' birth. In the Quran, it is mentioned in Surah Al-Imran (3:37) that Maryam (Mary), the mother of Jesus, was visited by the angel Jibril (Gabriel) and was told that she would give birth to a prophet and messenger named Isa (Jesus). The Quran also mentions the gifts given to Jesus at his birth in Surah Al-Imran (3:43-44):

"And when the angels said, 'Maryam, indeed Allah has chosen you, purified you, and chosen you above all women.' And they called her from behind the screen, saying, 'Maryam, come forth!' She replied, 'I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from any slave who does not approach honorably.'"

The gifts given to Jesus at his birth were gold, frankincense, and myrrh. In Islamic tradition, these gifts are considered symbolic of the nature and purpose of Jesus' mission.

Gold represents the wealth and status that Jesus would bring to humanity through his prophethood and message of guidance. Frankincense symbolizes the spiritual fragrance and incense-like effect that Jesus would have on those who followed him, purifying their hearts and souls. Myrrh, in particular, holds a special significance.

Myrrh is a fragrant resin extracted from the Commiphora tree, known for its medicinal properties and use as an antiseptic. In Islamic tradition, myrrh is associated with healing, purification, and protection. It is said that myrrh was used to preserve the bodies of the prophets in the grave, ensuring their purity and honor.

In the context of Jesus' birth, the gift of myrrh can be seen as a symbol of his role as a healer and protector of humanity. As a prophet and messenger, Jesus brought guidance, healing, and protection to those who followed him. The gift of myrrh thus foreshadowed his mission to heal the spiritual sicknesses of humanity and protect them from the forces of evil.

In summary, the significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth lies in its symbolism of healing, purification, and protection â€“ reflecting Jesus' role as a prophet, messenger, and healer of humanity.

Grade: 65

Comment: The response provides insightful information about the significance of myrrh in Islamic tradition and its symbolism in relation to Jesus' birth and mission. However, the response does not directly address the concern about deepening appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission through understanding the symbolism of the gifts. Additionally, from a Christian perspective, the significance of myrrh in symbolizing Jesus' suffering and death as the Messiah who sacrificed himself for humanity's sins is not emphasized in the evaluation of the response.
