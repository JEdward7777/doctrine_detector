While the answer does not directly address the concern provided regarding the symbolism of Jesus' suffering and death as the Messiah, it does offer a valuable perspective on the role of myrrh in portraying Jesus as a healer and protector of humanity. Expanding on the link between myrrh and Jesus' sacrificial death would have further enriched the depth of understanding of Jesus' purpose and mission."
