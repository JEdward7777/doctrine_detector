However, the response could have more explicitly highlighted the distinct Christian belief in the Trinity (God the Father, God the Son - Jesus, and God the Holy Spirit) as foundational to understanding Jesus as the \"image of God.\" Additionally, while the response acknowledges differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs, it could have further emphasized the Christian perspective on Jesus' nature as both fully divine and fully human, which is a unique aspect of Christian theology."
