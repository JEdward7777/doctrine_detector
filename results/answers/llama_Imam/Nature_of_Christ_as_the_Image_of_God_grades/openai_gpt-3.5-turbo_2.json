The response acknowledges the differences in theological understanding between Islam and Christianity while promoting mutual respect and understanding. The only slight deduction is that the response does not explicitly state that Jesus is God himself and shares the same essence with God the Father, which would have made the connection to Christ's divinity more explicit from a Christian worldview perspective."
