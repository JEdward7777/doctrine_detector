However, the response could have been more focused on specifically Christian teachings rather than incorporating Islamic perspectives. Additionally, there were missed opportunities to delve deeper into specific Biblical passages related to exhortation. The general tone and content were respectful and informative, albeit with a tangential inclusion of Islamic elements that could be deemed unnecessary for addressing a Christian-specific question."
