  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough explanation of Christian exhortation based on the New Testament, the core concern of delivering encouragement in a loving and supportive manner was not directly addressed in their response. The emphasis on love as motivation and humility in exhortation aligns well with Christian teachings, but the key point of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner was not explicitly mentioned. The student showed a good understanding of Christian principles but missed the specific focus of the concern provided."
