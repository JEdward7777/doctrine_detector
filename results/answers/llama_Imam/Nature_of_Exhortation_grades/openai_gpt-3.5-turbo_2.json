  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful exploration of Christian exhortation based on the New Testament, aligning well with the provided answer about exhorting in love. The emphasis on love, mutual encouragement, scripture-based exhortation, humility, and the goal of building up the body of Christ all demonstrate a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on encouragement. The only slight point of improvement could be further connecting the importance of delivering encouragement in a loving and supportive manner explicitly within the discussion of the principles outlined."
