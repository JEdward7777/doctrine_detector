  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the importance of spiritual connection in worship, focusing on inner transformation, purification of intentions, spiritual connection, authenticity, and a holistic approach. However, the student's answer was more focused on Islamic beliefs and practices rather than addressing the Christian perspective and the significance of Jesus' statement specifically. To improve the grade, the student needs to relate the answer more directly to the Christian worldview and how understanding God as a spirit influences worship within that context."
