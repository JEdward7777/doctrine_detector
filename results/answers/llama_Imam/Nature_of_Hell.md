## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that my understanding is based on the Quranic perspective, which differs slightly from the biblical account. However, I'll provide an overview of what the Bible says about hell, as you requested.

According to the Bible, hell is often referred to as "Hades" or the "Lake of Fire." The concept of eternal punishment is not explicitly stated in the Old Testament, but it is implied in passages like Isaiah 66:24 and Ezekiel 38-39. In these verses, the wicked are punished by being devoured by worms and fire.

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ and other authors use parables and metaphors to describe the fate of those who reject God's love. For example:

* Matthew 13:40-42 describes hell as a place where the wicked will be thrown into a furnace where there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
* Mark 9:43-48 tells us that if our hands, feet, or eyes cause us to sin, we should cut them off and enter eternal life. This is often interpreted as a warning against committing sinful acts that lead to damnation.
* Luke 16:19-26 describes the story of Lazarus and the rich man. The rich man, who did not show compassion to Lazarus during his lifetime, is punished in Hades by being tormented by the flames.

The Bible also speaks about a "second death" or a "second resurrection," where those who reject God's offer of salvation will be resurrected at the end of time and judged according to their deeds. This is described in Revelation 20:11-15, which mentions the lake of fire, where those who are not found written in the Book of Life will be thrown.

It is important to note that the concept of hell as a place of eternal punishment is not universally accepted among all Christian denominations and traditions.

As a Muslim, I must emphasize that my understanding of hell is rooted in the Quranic account. According to the Quran, the fires of hell are described in surahs such as 2:257, where those who reject Allah's guidance will be punished with fire and worm. The Quran also speaks about the concept of Yaqeen (certainty), where the believer can have absolute confidence that they will enter Paradise, while the disbeliever will face eternal punishment.

I hope this brief overview provides some insight into the biblical perspective on hell. May Allah guide us all to the path of righteousness and mercy.
