The inclusion of Islamic beliefs and the Quranic perspective, while informative, detracts from a thorough explanation based solely on Christian teachings. Focusing solely on the biblical account of hell and providing a deeper analysis of key verses would have strengthened the response. Additionally, presenting a clear distinction between Islamic and Christian beliefs on the topic would have been beneficial."
