  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the Biblical perspective on hell, drawing from both Old and New Testament passages. However, there was a significant focus on comparing the Quranic perspective, which was not directly relevant to the question posed. While the student demonstrated knowledge of Biblical references and interpretations, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the severity and purpose of hell as emphasized in the Christian understanding of judgment and salvation."
