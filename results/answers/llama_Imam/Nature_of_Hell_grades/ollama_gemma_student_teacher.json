They provide detailed references from both the Old and New Testaments, explaining the various metaphors and parables used in the scriptures to describe the fate of the wicked. Additionally, the student acknowledges the diversity of beliefs among Christian denominations regarding the concept of hell. \n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from a clearer explanation of the purpose of hell in the Christian worldview. It would also be helpful to elaborate on the concept of eternal punishment and its implications for understanding God's justice and mercy."
