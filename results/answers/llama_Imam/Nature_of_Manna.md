## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that the concept of manna is not specific to Islam, but rather it is mentioned in the Torah, which is part of the Christian scripture. According to the biblical account, manna was a food substance sent by God to sustain the Israelites during their 40-year journey through the wilderness after they left slavery in Egypt.

The Bible describes the appearance and taste of manna as follows:

* Appearance: The Bible describes manna as being like coriander seed or honey (Exodus 16:31). Some commentators believe it may have resembled a type of fine white powder, similar to the texture of communion wafers.
* Taste: According to Exodus 16:31-32, when the Israelites collected and ground the manna into flour, they could make cakes that tasted like baked goods or bread. The Bible also mentions that the manna had a sweet taste (Numbers 11:7).

It is important to note that the biblical account of manna is not meant to be taken literally, but rather it serves as a symbolic representation of God's provision and care for His people. As Muslims, we do not recognize the Bible as a divine text, but rather as a historical record of the experiences of the Israelites.
