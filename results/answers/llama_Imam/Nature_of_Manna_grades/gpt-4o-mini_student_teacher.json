However, the student's perspective as a Muslim Imam and the emphasis on not recognizing the Bible as a divine text detracts from fully embracing the understanding of the miraculous provision of God in the Christian worldview. It would have been beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the significance of manna in highlighting God's care and provision for His people, in line with the Christian perspective."
