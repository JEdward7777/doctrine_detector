  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical account of manna and addresses the concern of understanding the miraculous provision of God. The student provides a detailed description of the appearance and taste of manna, citing relevant biblical passages. However, the deduction in grade reflects that the student's response is primarily focused on explaining the manna as a symbolic representation of God's provision, rather than providing a literal description."
