  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provides a clear explanation from a Muslim perspective on how the miracles of Jesus as described in the Quran reveal his identity as a prophet, servant, and messenger of Allah. However, from a Christian worldview, doctrinal correctness is a priority, and the perspective presented here differs significantly from Christian beliefs about Jesus. The response does not address key Christian beliefs about Jesus as the Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, and the Savior of humanity through his death and resurrection. The grade reflects the accurate presentation of Islamic beliefs but lacks doctrinal accuracy within a Christian worldview."
