  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of the miracles of Jesus as described in the Quran and how they reveal aspects of his identity as a prophet and servant of Allah. However, from a Christian worldview, the crucial aspect of Jesus' miracles affirming His divine nature as God and the Messiah is missing in the student's answer. The student does not address this specific concern, which significantly detracts from the Christian perspective on the importance of Jesus' miracles."
