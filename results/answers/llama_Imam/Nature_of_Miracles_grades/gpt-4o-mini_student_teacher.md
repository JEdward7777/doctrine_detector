## [Answer](../Nature_of_Miracles.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I believe that the Quranic account of Jesus (peace be upon him) is more comprehensive and accurate than any other religious text. The Quran describes Jesus as a prophet, messenger, and servant of Allah, who was sent to guide the Children of Israel.

The miracles performed by Jesus, as mentioned in the Quran, are significant because they demonstrate His identity as a true prophet and servant of Allah. These miracles include:

1. Healing the blind and the leper (Quran 3:49): This miracle shows that Jesus had the power to cure physical ailments, which is a characteristic of prophets and messengers.
2. Bringing forth the dead (Quran 5:110): This miracle demonstrates Jesus' ability to bring life back to those who had passed away, which is a divine attribute reserved for Allah alone.
3. Speaking from infancy (Quran 19:32-33): The Quran describes how Jesus spoke from his cradle, blessing and praising Allah. This miracle highlights Jesus' prophetic nature and his role as a messenger of Allah.

These miracles reveal several aspects about Jesus' identity:

1. Jesus is a prophet: His ability to perform miracles demonstrates that he was a true prophet, sent by Allah to guide humanity.
2. Jesus is a servant of Allah: The Quran emphasizes that Jesus performed these miracles not for personal gain or glory, but as a servant of Allah, fulfilling His will and plan.
3. Jesus is distinct from God: While Jesus had certain attributes and abilities, the Quran is clear that he was not divine, nor did he claim to be equal to Allah. He recognized Allah's sovereignty and performed miracles only by His permission.

In conclusion, the miracles performed by Jesus, as described in the Quran, reveal his identity as a prophet, servant, and messenger of Allah. They demonstrate his ability to perform extraordinary feats, which were not for personal gain or glory, but rather as a fulfillment of Allah's will and plan.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of the miracles of Jesus as described in the Quran and how they reveal aspects of his identity as a prophet and servant of Allah. However, from a Christian worldview, the crucial aspect of Jesus' miracles affirming His divine nature as God and the Messiah is missing in the student's answer. The student does not address this specific concern, which significantly detracts from the Christian perspective on the importance of Jesus' miracles.
