  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Quranic account of Jesus' miracles and their significance in affirming his identity as a prophet and servant of Allah. However, it does not fully align with the Christian specific worldview that Jesus is God or the Christ. The student's conclusion focuses on Jesus' role as a prophet, servant, and messenger, but does not explicitly address the claim that his miracles reveal his divine nature."
