  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided does not align with the specified concern regarding the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature. The answer given states that the miracles reveal Jesus as God and the Messiah, which is accurate from a Christian perspective, but the response being graded focuses on a Muslim understanding of Jesus as a prophet and servant of Allah, which does not address the concern raised."
