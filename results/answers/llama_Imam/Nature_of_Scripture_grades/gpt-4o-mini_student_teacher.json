  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that demonstrates an understanding of the Christian perspective on scripture and the Word of God. However, the student's answer included unnecessary information about Islam which was not relevant to the question at hand. Additionally, while the student correctly described the distinction between scripture and the Word of God in Christianity, the response could have been more concise and focused solely on the Christian perspective. Overall, a decent effort but could have been improved with more focus on the specific concern provided."
