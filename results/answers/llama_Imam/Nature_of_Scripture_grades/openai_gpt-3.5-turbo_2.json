It effectively distinguishes between scripture as the written word of God (referring to the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament) and the Word of God as Jesus Christ, the embodiment of God's message. The response also acknowledges the differences in understanding of divine revelation between Christianity and Islam, demonstrating respect for both perspectives. Overall, a well-informed and respectful perspective from a Christian worldview."
