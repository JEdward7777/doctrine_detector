The student effectively elaborates on how the term \"scripture\" primarily refers to the written texts of the Bible while \"the Word of God\" has a deeper meaning related to Jesus Christ as the embodiment of God's word. The response could have been improved by integrating more specific biblical references to support the explanation further. Additionally, the connection between Jesus as the Word of God and written scripture could have been articulated more clearly."
