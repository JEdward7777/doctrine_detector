  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the roles of sinful nature and external influences in temptation. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer falls short as it doesn't align with Christian theological teachings on the origins of sin, the nature of man, and the role of external influences in temptation. The references to the Quranic verses and Islamic concepts are not applicable in this context. To improve the grade, the student should focus on providing a Christian-specific understanding of sinful nature, external influences, and the response to temptation based on biblical teachings and Christian doctrine."
