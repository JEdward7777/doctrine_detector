  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the sources of temptation, focusing on the concepts of fitra, Shaytan, and external influences. While the response was well-written and insightful, it deviated from the Christian-specific worldview requested. A Christian perspective emphasizes the sinful nature inherited from Adam and Eve's fall, as well as the role of external influences like the devil in tempting individuals. The student's answer, therefore, does not directly address the Christian understanding of temptation, resulting in a lower grade in this context."
