## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we believe that the Quranic concept of fitra (natural disposition) is important to understand in this context.

Firstly, it is essential to acknowledge that our sinful nature is a result of Shaytan's (Satan's) whisperings in us. The Quran says: "And indeed, Shaytan is sworn enemy to you. So he took his brethren and marched forth to them from the right side of the absence." (Quran 17:53)

This means that our inherent nature is inclined towards good, but it can be corrupted by external influences and internal whispers.

In terms of external influences, we must recognize that this dunya (world) is filled with temptations, distractions, and corrupting influences. The Quran warns us: "And those who have believed among the Children of Israel â€“ when there came to them a messenger from Allah with clear signs and a Scripture, they were, in their envy, far-off from him." (Quran 2:110)

These external influences can take many forms, such as the allurements of wealth, status, power, or worldly possessions. They can also manifest as societal pressures, family expectations, or peer influence.

However, it is crucial to remember that our sinful nature and external influences are not an excuse for falling into sin. Rather, they serve as a reminder of the importance of spiritual discipline and self-reflection.

As Muslims, we must strive to cultivate taqwa (God-consciousness) and istiqaamah (steadfastness) in our lives. This involves recognizing our weaknesses, seeking forgiveness from Allah, and making a conscious effort to follow His guidance.

In conclusion, while our sinful nature and external influences can certainly tempt us, it is our responsibility as Muslims to recognize these threats and actively work towards cultivating spiritual strength and resilience.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the sources of temptation, focusing on the concepts of fitra, Shaytan, and external influences. While the response was well-written and insightful, it deviated from the Christian-specific worldview requested. A Christian perspective emphasizes the sinful nature inherited from Adam and Eve's fall, as well as the role of external influences like the devil in tempting individuals. The student's answer, therefore, does not directly address the Christian understanding of temptation, resulting in a lower grade in this context.
