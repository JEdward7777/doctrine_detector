  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation from a Muslim perspective on the sources and reasons for temptation, specifically focusing on the Quranic concept of fitra and external influences. While the content aligns with a Christian worldview in recognizing the role of Satan and external influences in tempting individuals to sin, the grade is lower due to the lack of direct engagement with Christian teaching on this topic. Additionally, the response could have explored parallels or differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on temptation to enhance the relevance to the given concern."
