## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must emphasize that the Bible is not our primary source of guidance, as Muslims believe that God has sent His final message to humanity through the Quran. However, since you have asked about the Bible's perspective on wickedness, I will provide an overview based on Islamic understanding and consultation with biblical scholars.

The Bible describes individuals who engage in wicked or sinful actions as being "wicked" (e.g., Matthew 5:21-22; John 3:19-20) or "evil" (e.g., Psalm 37:1). These actions can include things like murder, adultery, theft, and idolatry. The Bible teaches that such individuals are opposed to God's will and are ultimately headed for judgment (e.g., Romans 1:18; Ephesians 2:1-3).

Regarding the state of wicked individuals, the Bible suggests that they are:

1. Separated from God: The Bible says that those who practice wickedness have turned away from God and are not seeking His guidance or forgiveness (Isaiah 59:2).
2. Under divine judgment: The Bible warns that those who persist in wickedness will face divine judgment, which can include punishment and even eternal separation from God (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:15).
3. Condemned by their own actions: The Bible teaches that the wicked have set themselves against God's ways and are therefore condemned by their own actions (Romans 1:32-33).
4. In need of repentance and forgiveness: However, the Bible also offers a message of hope to those who recognize their wickedness and turn to God in repentance and faith (Luke 15:18-21; Romans 3:24).

It's essential to note that Islamic theology views all human beings as being capable of both good and evil, and that our actions have consequences in this life and the next. Muslims believe that the Quran provides guidance on how to live a righteous life and avoid wickedness, and that true repentance and forgiveness are possible only through submission to God's will.

I hope this answer is helpful in providing an Islamic perspective on the Bible's teachings about wickedness.
