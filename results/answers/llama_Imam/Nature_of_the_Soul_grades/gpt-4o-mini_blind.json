  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComments: The answer provides a good overview of the Islamic perspective on the concepts of \"soul\" and \"spirit\" and draws parallels with the biblical terms. However, the explanation lacks clear differentiation between the distinct biblical understanding of soul and spirit. To improve the grade, the student should offer a more precise comparison based on biblical definitions and emphasize the doctrinal differences between Christian and Islamic perspectives on these concepts. Additionally, focusing more on the biblical texts and theology would enhance the overall response."
