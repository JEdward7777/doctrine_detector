However, the answer did not directly address the specific concern of differentiating between 'soul' and 'spirit' according to the Bible. The response focused more on providing insights into the Islamic understanding rather than thoroughly examining the biblical distinctions between these concepts. An ideal answer would have concentrated on how the Bible portrays the differentiation between 'soul' and 'spirit' for a comprehensive understanding from a Christian worldview."
