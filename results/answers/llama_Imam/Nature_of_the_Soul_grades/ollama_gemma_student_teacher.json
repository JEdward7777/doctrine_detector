Additionally, the student acknowledges the absence of direct equivalents in Islamic theology while drawing parallels between the Islamic concepts of \"nafs\" and \"ruh\" and the biblical terms. However, the conclusion could have benefited from further elaboration on the ambiguity of the relationship between the two concepts in biblical theology."
