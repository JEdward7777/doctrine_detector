However, the response could be enhanced by providing a more explicit connection between the biblical definitions of \"soul\" and \"spirit\" and how they impact the interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and the relationship with God. A more direct application of the biblical definitions to the interpretation of scripture would strengthen the response."
