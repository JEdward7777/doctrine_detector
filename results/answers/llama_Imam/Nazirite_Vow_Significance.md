## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum, brother or sister. The Nazirite vow is an important aspect of Islamic teachings, and I'm happy to help clarify its key restrictions for you.

The Nazirite vow is a sacred commitment to abstain from certain activities and habits for a specific period, as described in Numbers 6:1-4. When a Muslim takes the Nazirite vow, they undertake the following restrictions:

1. Abstaining from wine: A Nazirite must avoid consuming any intoxicating substances, including wine.
2. Avoiding grapes: This includes abstaining from eating grapes or drinking grape juice during their period of commitment.
3. Refraining from cutting one's hair: As a symbol of their commitment, Nazirites should not cut their hair until the end of their vow.
4. Staying away from dead bodies: A Nazirite must avoid coming into contact with any corpses or even touching someone who has recently died.

By observing these restrictions, a Muslim demonstrates their devotion to Allah and commitment to spiritual purification during their Nazirite period. May Allah guide us all in our spiritual journeys.
