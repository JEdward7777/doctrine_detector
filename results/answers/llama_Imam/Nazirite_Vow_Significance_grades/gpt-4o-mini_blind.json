  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComments: The answer provided lacks doctrinal correctness as it inaccurately presents the Nazirite vow within an Islamic context, which is a serious misrepresentation. The Nazirite vow is specific to the Old Testament of the Bible and is not a concept found in Islamic teachings. The response also inaccurately attributes beliefs and practices to Islam that are not part of Islamic theology. Clarification and correction on these points are needed for a higher grade."
