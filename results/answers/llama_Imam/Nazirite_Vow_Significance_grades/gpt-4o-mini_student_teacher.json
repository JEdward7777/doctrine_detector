  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided mixes Islamic teachings with the Christian practice of the Nazirite vow, which is inaccurate. The student presented incorrect information about the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow, failing to accurately reflect the biblical context provided in Numbers 6:1-4. Additionally, the response did not demonstrate an understanding of the purpose and significance of the Nazirite vow within the Christian worldview. Further clarification and study on biblical teachings regarding the Nazirite vow are needed for a more accurate response."
