  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Christian perspective on the new covenant established through Jesus. They clearly articulate the Islamic belief that Muslims do not recognize the concept of a new covenant through Jesus and provide a detailed explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding prophets and the Quran. However, the answer does not directly address the concern raised in the prompt regarding the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises."
