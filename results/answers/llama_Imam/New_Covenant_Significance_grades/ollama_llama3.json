  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThis response does not adequately address the concern about recognizing the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises. While it provides some information about Islamic views on Jesus, it does not engage with the Christian concept of the new covenant and its significance. The response primarily presents an Islamic perspective without addressing or acknowledging the Christian view.\n\nThe lack of engagement with the Christian concern is a significant factor in this low grade. The response could be improved by providing a more nuanced understanding of both perspectives and exploring areas of common ground."
