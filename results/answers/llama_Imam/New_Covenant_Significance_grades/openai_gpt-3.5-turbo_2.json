From a Christian worldview, the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice as the basis for the new covenant is a foundational belief that shapes Christian faith and understanding of salvation. It is essential to acknowledge and engage with this aspect when discussing differences in beliefs between Islam and Christianity."
