From a Christian worldview, the response did not engage with the central theological concept of Jesus' sacrificial atonement as the foundation of the new covenant. The focus on Islamic beliefs, while informative, does not fully address the concern raised in relation to the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice within the context of God's promises."
