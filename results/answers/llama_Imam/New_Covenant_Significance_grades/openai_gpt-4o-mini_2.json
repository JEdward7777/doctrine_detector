However, it did not address the specific concern regarding the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises and the transformative power it holds based on the new covenant belief. In a Christian worldview, the belief in Jesus' sacrifice as atonement for sins and the fulfillment of God's promises through the new covenant is central to understanding his significance."
