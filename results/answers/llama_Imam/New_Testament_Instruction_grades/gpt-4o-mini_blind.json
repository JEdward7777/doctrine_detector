The inclusion of specific verses and their contexts adds depth to the explanation. However, the ending remark, \"May Allah guide us all in our quest for knowledge and righteousness,\" does not align with a Christian worldview. A more appropriate conclusion would have been a prayer or blessing invoking God in the name of Jesus Christ."
