They provide specific examples from the Gospels, Paul's epistles, Colossians, Hebrews, and Revelation to support their claims. The conclusion effectively highlights the application of Psalms to the understanding and worship of Jesus Christ. The inclusion of Islamic salutation and blessing adds a respectful and inclusive touch."
