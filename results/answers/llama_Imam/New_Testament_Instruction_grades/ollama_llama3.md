Assalamu alaikum,

In the New Testament, Christians receive the following instructions regarding Psalms:

1. Jesus quotes from Psalms: In the Gospels, Jesus quotes from various psalms (e.g., Psalm 22:1, Matthew 27:46; Psalm 31:5, John 19:30) to validate His divinity and messianic role.
2. Paul references Psalms in his epistles: The Apostle Paul, a key figure in Christian theology, refers to specific psalms (e.g., Psalm 16:10, Acts 2:25-31; Psalm 68:18, Ephesians 4:8) as evidence of Jesus' resurrection and glorification.
3. Colossians 1:15-20: In this passage, Paul quotes from Psalm 2:7, stating that Jesus is the "firstborn over all creation" (Psalm 2:7, Colossians 1:15).
4. Hebrews 1-3: The Epistle to the Hebrews uses psalms to demonstrate Jesus' superiority over angels and other spiritual beings. For example, it quotes Psalm 2:12 in Hebrews 1:6.
5. Revelation 15:3-4: The Book of Revelation references Psalm 2:1-3 and Psalm 149:1-4 to describe the worship of God and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.

In summary, Christians view Psalms as a source of inspiration, guidance, and validation for their faith. They see the psalmists' prayers, praises, and prophetic utterances as reflecting the character and nature of God, which they then apply to their understanding of Jesus Christ.

May Allah guide us all in our quest for knowledge and righteousness.

40.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 40.

While the response does mention the New Testament, it only scratches the surface in terms of how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship. The primary concern was identifying how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship, but the response primarily focuses on quoting specific instances where Jesus and the apostles reference Psalms in their teachings. This information is not directly applicable to modern-day worship practices.

To receive a higher grade, the response would need to delve deeper into how the principles and themes presented in the Psalms can be applied to contemporary Christian worship, such as exploring how Psalmic prayers and praises can inform our own prayers and worship songs. As it stands, the response does not provide sufficient insight or practical application for modern-day Christians seeking to understand how biblical teachings can shape their worship practices.

Comment: The response provides some valuable information about Jesus and the apostles referencing Psalms in the New Testament, but it falls short in terms of addressing the primary concern of identifying how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship.
