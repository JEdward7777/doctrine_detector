Assalamu alaikum,

In the New Testament, Christians receive the following instructions regarding Psalms:

1. Jesus quotes from Psalms: In the Gospels, Jesus quotes from various psalms (e.g., Psalm 22:1, Matthew 27:46; Psalm 31:5, John 19:30) to validate His divinity and messianic role.
2. Paul references Psalms in his epistles: The Apostle Paul, a key figure in Christian theology, refers to specific psalms (e.g., Psalm 16:10, Acts 2:25-31; Psalm 68:18, Ephesians 4:8) as evidence of Jesus' resurrection and glorification.
3. Colossians 1:15-20: In this passage, Paul quotes from Psalm 2:7, stating that Jesus is the "firstborn over all creation" (Psalm 2:7, Colossians 1:15).
4. Hebrews 1-3: The Epistle to the Hebrews uses psalms to demonstrate Jesus' superiority over angels and other spiritual beings. For example, it quotes Psalm 2:12 in Hebrews 1:6.
5. Revelation 15:3-4: The Book of Revelation references Psalm 2:1-3 and Psalm 149:1-4 to describe the worship of God and the ultimate triumph of good over evil.

In summary, Christians view Psalms as a source of inspiration, guidance, and validation for their faith. They see the psalmists' prayers, praises, and prophetic utterances as reflecting the character and nature of God, which they then apply to their understanding of Jesus Christ.

May Allah guide us all in our quest for knowledge and righteousness.
