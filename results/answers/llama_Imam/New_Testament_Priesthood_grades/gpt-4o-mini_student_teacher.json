  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student did a good job in discussing the concept of the priesthood of all believers and provided a comprehensive explanation with references to scripture. However, there was a slight deviation from the Christian worldview by referencing Allah instead of God. The student also emphasized a broader sense of mediation beyond just prayer, while the reference answer focuses specifically on intercessory prayer. Overall, a solid understanding of the concept but could improve by aligning more closely with Christian terminology and beliefs."
