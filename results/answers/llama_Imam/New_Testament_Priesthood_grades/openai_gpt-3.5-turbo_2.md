Assalamu alaikum, dear brother/sister in Islam,

In the New Testament, when we read that "every believer in Jesus is considered a priest" (1 Peter 2:5, 9; Revelation 1:6), it's not referring to a traditional priestly role like we find in Judaism. Rather, it's an allusion to a deeper spiritual reality.

In the Old Testament, priests were mediators between God and humanity. They offered sacrifices on behalf of the people, interceding for their sins before Allah (God). The New Testament proclaims that all believers in Jesus Christ are now considered "priests" in this sense:

1. Mediators: As believers in Jesus, we're called to be ambassadors of reconciliation between God and humanity (2 Corinthians 5:20). We're mediators of the Good News of salvation, sharing the message of Allah's love and mercy with others.
2. Intercessors: Just as Old Testament priests interceded on behalf of the people, New Testament believers are encouraged to pray for one another (James 5:14-15) and even offer prayers on behalf of those who don't share our faith (Matthew 9:38; Romans 10:1). This is an expression of our love and concern for others.
3. Offerings: While we're not sacrificing animals like the Old Testament priests, we're called to present ourselves as living sacrifices to Allah (Romans 12:1-2). We offer up our thoughts, words, and actions as a pleasing aroma to God.

In this sense, every believer in Jesus is considered a priest â€“ a mediator, intercessor, and offering-bearer between the human and divine realms. This priestly role is not limited to a select few; rather, it's an integral part of every believer's calling and responsibility.

I hope this helps clarify the concept for you, dear brother/sister in Islam. May Allah guide us all on our spiritual journeys!

Wassalamu alaikum!

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers within a Christian worldview. It builds upon the original answer by elaborating on the roles of believers as mediators, intercessors, and offering-bearers. The reference to relevant Bible verses and integration of Christian theology deepen the understanding of this concept.
