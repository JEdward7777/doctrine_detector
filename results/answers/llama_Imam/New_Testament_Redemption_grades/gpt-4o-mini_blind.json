The student effectively contrasts the external rituals of purification in the Old Testament with the internal purification brought about by Jesus Christ in the New Testament. However, the response could have been stronger by further emphasizing the centrality of Jesus Christ's sacrificial death on the cross as the ultimate means of purification. Additionally, the mention of the Holy Spirit's role in purification could have been elaborated on with more scriptural references to strengthen the argument."
