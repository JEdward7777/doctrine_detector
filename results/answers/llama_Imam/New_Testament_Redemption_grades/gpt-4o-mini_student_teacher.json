  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained response comparing the concepts of purification in the Old and New Testaments. They accurately highlighted the shift from external rituals to internal cleansing through Jesus' sacrifice and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. However, they could have emphasized more explicitly on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, as the concern stated. Overall, a strong and informed understanding of the topic is shown in the response."
