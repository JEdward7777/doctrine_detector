It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the central role of Jesus' sacrifice in cleansing humanity from sin and the shift from external rituals to internal transformation in the New Testament. The Christian worldview is well-represented in connecting the concept of purification to faith in Jesus and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit."
