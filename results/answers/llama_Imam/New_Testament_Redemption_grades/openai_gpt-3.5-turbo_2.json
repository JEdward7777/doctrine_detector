It aligns well with the concern of recognizing the centrality of Christ's sacrifice in providing cleansing from sin. The reference to specific Bible verses further strengthens the Christian perspective on purification. Great job overall, with minor room for improvement in discussing how the Holy Spirit plays a role in the purification process."
