It clearly articulates how purification in the New Testament transcends external rituals and emphasizes internal cleansing through faith in Jesus Christ. The theological connection between purification, repentance, trust in Jesus, and His sacrifice is well-explained, aligning with the concern provided. Overall, a strong and insightful reflection from a Christian perspective."
