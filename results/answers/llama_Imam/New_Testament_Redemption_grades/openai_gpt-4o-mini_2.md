## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaykum (peace be upon you). I'm happy to help clarify how the concept of purification evolves from the Old Testament to the New Testament.

In the Old Testament, purification was primarily focused on removing ritual impurities and restoring a person's spiritual and physical state to be fit for worship. This was achieved through various rituals and offerings, often involving animal sacrifices, ceremonial washings, and dietary restrictions (Leviticus 11-15). The focus was on external cleansing, making sure one's actions and intentions were pure in the eyes of God.

In contrast, the New Testament introduces a more profound understanding of purification. Jesus Christ, as the ultimate sacrifice, cleanses humanity from sin and its effects. This is reflected in passages like John 1:29 ("Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!") and Hebrews 9:13-14 ("If the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are defiled, sanctify them in relation to their flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?").

In this context, purification becomes an internal process. Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is seen as the ultimate means of forgiveness and cleansing from sin (Matthew 26:28-30; Hebrews 9:22). This new understanding emphasizes the importance of a pure heart and a renewed spirit, rather than just external rituals.

In the New Testament, purification is also associated with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. As believers receive the Spirit, they are transformed from the inside out, becoming vessels for God's work (Acts 15:8-9; Ephesians 4:23-24). This inner cleansing is seen as a result of one's faith in Jesus Christ and their submission to His will.

In summary, while both Testaments emphasize purification, the Old Testament focuses on external rituals and sacrifices, whereas the New Testament emphasizes internal cleansing through Jesus' sacrifice and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
