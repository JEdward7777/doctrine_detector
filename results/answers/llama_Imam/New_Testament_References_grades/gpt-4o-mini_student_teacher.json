The student correctly referenced relevant passages from the New Testament that suggest John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite and drew reasonable connections to support their argument. However, without mentioning the angel's announcement to Zechariah regarding John's abstinence from strong drink, a crucial aspect of the Nazirite vow, the answer falls short of fully addressing the question. It is important to acknowledge the significance of this specific evidence in establishing John's potential Nazirite status."
