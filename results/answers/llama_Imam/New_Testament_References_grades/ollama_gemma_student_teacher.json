  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and thorough examination of the textual evidence in the New Testament to support the claim that John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite. The student provides clear and well-reasoned interpretations of the relevant passages, drawing parallels between John's practices and the known vows of the Nazirite. The response also acknowledges the absence of explicit statements regarding John's status as a Nazirite but argues for the possibility based on the available hints and parallels."
