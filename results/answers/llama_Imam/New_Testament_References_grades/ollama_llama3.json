  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of connecting Old Testament practices (Nazirite vow) with New Testament figures (John the Baptist) to better understand biblical continuity, which aligns with the specified concern. The writer provides several relevant passages from the New Testament and draws parallels between John's behavior and the characteristics of a Nazirite.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the response doesn't explicitly address the angel's announcement to Zechariah mentioned in the provided answer. While the writer does mention the possibility that John might not have buried his own body due to being a Nazirite, they don't directly connect this to the angel's statement about John not drinking strong drink.\n\nOverall, however, the response is well-organized, thoughtful, and effectively applies Old Testament principles to New Testament figures."
