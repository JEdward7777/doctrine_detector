The additional passages cited from the New Testament support the argument that John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite. However, it would have been beneficial to delve deeper into the theological significance of the Nazirite vow in the context of John's role as the forerunner of Christ. Overall, a well-reasoned and insightful interpretation."
