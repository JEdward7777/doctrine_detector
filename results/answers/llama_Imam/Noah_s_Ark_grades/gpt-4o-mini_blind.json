However, the question specifically asked for the purpose of Noah's Ark as described in the Bible, not the Quran. The answer should have focused on the biblical account and not introduced interpretations from another religious text. Additionally, while it is commendable to emphasize the lessons of obedience and following God's commands, the doctrinal correctness in this context would have required a clear and direct explanation of the purpose of Noah's Ark as described in the Bible."
