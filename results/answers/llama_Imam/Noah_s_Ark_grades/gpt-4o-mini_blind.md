## [Answer](../Noah_s_Ark.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum, my dear brother/sister. The story of Noah's Ark is indeed a significant one in the Quranic narrative, although the details may differ slightly from the biblical account.

In the Quran (Chapter 7: 59-74), we are told that Allah (God) sent a message to Nuh (Noah) warning him of an impending flood that would destroy all life on earth due to humanity's corruption and disobedience. Allah instructed Nuh to build an ark, specifically designed for himself, his family, and two of every kind of animal.

The purpose of the Ark was twofold:

1. To save Nuh, his family, and a select group of animals from the impending flood, which would destroy all other life on earth.
2. To fulfill Allah's command to test humanity's obedience and devotion. The flood was a reminder of the importance of following Allah's laws and commands.

In Islamic tradition, the Ark is seen as a symbol of Allah's mercy and justice. By sending Nuh and his family aboard the Ark, Allah showed His compassion for those who were willing to listen and obey His commandments. At the same time, the flood served as a punishment for those who rejected the truth and refused to change their ways.

It is worth noting that in Islamic understanding, the story of Noah's Ark is not merely a historical account but also a prophetic warning about the consequences of disobedience and the importance of following Allah's guidance.

Comments: The answer provided contains some accurate information regarding the Islamic perspective on the story of Noah's Ark as found in the Quran. However, the question specifically asked for the purpose of Noah's Ark as described in the Bible, not the Quran. The answer should have focused on the biblical account and not introduced interpretations from another religious text. Additionally, while it is commendable to emphasize the lessons of obedience and following God's commands, the doctrinal correctness in this context would have required a clear and direct explanation of the purpose of Noah's Ark as described in the Bible.
