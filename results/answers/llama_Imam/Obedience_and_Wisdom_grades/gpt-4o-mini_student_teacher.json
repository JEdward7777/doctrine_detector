  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student gave a well-written and thoughtful response rooted in Islamic beliefs about wisdom and guidance from Allah. They provided a detailed explanation of how listening to God in Islam entails aligning one's actions with His Will, studying the Quran, and seeking guidance from religious figures. However, the response did not directly address the Christian perspective on the relationship between listening to God and wisdom. To improve, the student could have incorporated Christian teachings on wisdom and obedience to God."
