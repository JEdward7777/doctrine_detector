  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response largely aligns with the given answer, emphasizing the importance of listening to God and obeying His will in order to gain wisdom. The author also provides a clear biblical basis for their understanding, citing Quranic verses that support the idea that wisdom comes from God's guidance.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be strengthened:\n\n* While the author does mention obedience to God as a key aspect of gaining wisdom, they do not explicitly state how this obedience leads to wisdom. Providing more concrete examples or illustrations would help to flesh out this point and make it more convincing.\n* The response could also benefit from a clearer articulation of how recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom enhances one's spiritual journey. While the author touches on this idea, they do not fully develop it or provide concrete examples.\n\nOverall, however, the response is well-organized, easy to follow, and provides some thoughtful insights into the relationship between listening to God and gaining wisdom. With a bit more development of these ideas, it could be even stronger."
