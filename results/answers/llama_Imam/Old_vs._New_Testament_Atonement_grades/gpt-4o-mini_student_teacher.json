  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive comparison of the concept of atonement between the Old and New Testaments, highlighting key differences. However, the response does not directly address the specified concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The student includes insightful information from an Islamic perspective, but it detracts from the Christian-specific worldview focus required for this evaluation. Additionally, the response lacks conciseness and is somewhat verbose."
