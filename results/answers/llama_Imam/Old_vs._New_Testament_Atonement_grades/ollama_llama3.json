  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response an 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of providing a clear overview of the concept of atonement in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the differences between the two. It also provides a thoughtful comparison between the temporary nature of animal sacrifices in the Old Testament and the permanent nature of Jesus' sacrifice in the New Testament. The response effectively addresses the concern about clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history.\n\nHowever, I would deduct some points because the response does not fully engage with the Islamic perspective on atonement, which was explicitly mentioned as a concern. While it is acknowledged that the concept of atonement is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, it would have been helpful to explore this idea further and discuss how it relates to the broader discussion of atonement.\n\nOverall, I think the response does a good job of explaining the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history, but could be improved by incorporating more analysis of Islamic perspectives on this topic."
