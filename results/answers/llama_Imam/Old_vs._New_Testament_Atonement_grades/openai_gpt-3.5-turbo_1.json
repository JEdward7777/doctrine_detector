  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-developed explanation of the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history, comparing the Old Testament's temporary blood sacrifices to the New Testament's teaching of Christ's single sufficient sacrifice for all sins forever. The explanation is clear and aligns with a Christian worldview emphasizing the significance of Christ's atoning sacrifice. The response effectively addresses the specified concern and demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of atonement within the context of biblical history."
