It effectively addresses the specified concern by highlighting the difference between the ritualistic process of atonement in the Old Testament and the permanent reconciliation achieved through Jesus' sacrifice in the New Testament. The explanation is well-supported and reflects a good understanding of atonement within a Christian worldview."
