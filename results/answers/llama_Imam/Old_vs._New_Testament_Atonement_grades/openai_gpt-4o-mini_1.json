The explanation is clear and aligns with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the significance of Christ's sacrifice for eternal atonement. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the theological implications and significance of this transition, providing a deeper analysis of the shift from ritualistic atonement to the ultimate atonement through Christ."
