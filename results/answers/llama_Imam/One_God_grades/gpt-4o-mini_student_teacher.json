  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response addressing how to emphasize the concept of \"One God\" in translating the Bible for cultures that respect multiple deities. They incorporated principles of contextualization, emphasizing uniqueness, using analogies, highlighting God's unity, avoiding polytheistic language, and emphasizing monotheism. However, the response did not directly address the concern of ensuring no compromise on biblical monotheism, particularly in relation to the Trinity. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could strengthen their response by directly tying it back to the concern provided."
