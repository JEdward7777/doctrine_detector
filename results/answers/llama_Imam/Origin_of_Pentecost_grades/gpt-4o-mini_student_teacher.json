  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the historical and religious significance of the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) before the events described in the New Testament. They effectively connected the festival to the giving of the Torah, the harvest season, and the Israelites' freedom from slavery in Egypt. The student also mentioned the integration of Pentecost into early Christianity and its significance in Acts 2:1-47. However, the student could have further emphasized the direct connection of the Festival of Weeks to its fulfillment in Christ as specified in the concern."
