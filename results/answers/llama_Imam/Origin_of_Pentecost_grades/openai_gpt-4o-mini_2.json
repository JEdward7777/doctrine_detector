However, the response lacks a clear connection to the fulfillment of this festival in Christ. While it briefly mentions the significance of Pentecost in early Christianity with the descent of the Holy Spirit, it could have further emphasized the fulfillment of the Jewish festival through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the Christian Church at Pentecost."
