## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Asalamu alaykum, my brother or sister in faith.

The term "Christian" was not used to describe the followers of Jesus Christ until much later, actually in the 2nd century AD. In fact, the New Testament itself does not use this term to describe the believers in Jesus.

According to Christian tradition and historians, the earliest name given to Jesus' followers was actually "Nazarenes," after Nazareth, where Jesus grew up. This term is mentioned in Acts 24:5, where Paul refers to himself as a leader of the Nazarenes.

The term "Christian" is believed to have originated in Antioch, Syria (modern-day Antakya, Turkey), around 41-44 AD. According to Acts 11:26, during the reign of Emperor Claudius, the disciples in Antioch began calling themselves "Christians" (Greek: Χριστιανοί, Christianoi). This name likely arose from the fact that Jesus was often referred to as the Messiah or Christ in Greek, which was the language spoken by the majority of people in the Roman Empire at that time.

So, my dear brother or sister, while we Muslims do not accept the divinity of Jesus or consider him a prophet of God like Muhammad (peace be upon him), it is interesting to note the evolution of terms used to describe his followers.
