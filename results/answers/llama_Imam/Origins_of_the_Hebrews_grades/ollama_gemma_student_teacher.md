## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum brother, I'm happy to help clarify this important aspect of our shared history.

According to the Quran and the Bible, the Hebrews, also known as the Israelites, are descended from Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail (Ishmael). In fact, both the Quran and the Bible agree that Ibrahim was a prophet sent by Allah/God to guide humanity towards righteousness.

The story of Ibrahim's family is an important part of our shared history. Ibrahim had two sons: Ishmael and Ishaq (Isaac). Ishaq's descendants became known as the Israelites or Hebrews, while Ishmael's descendants are believed to have settled in the Arabian Peninsula and elsewhere.

In the Quran, it is written:

"And mention Ibrahim who was tried by his Lord with words: 'O Ibrahim, you have already fulfilled the vow of Ismail. You have accepted every word.' And We gave him the good news of Ishaq's birth, a prophet from among those obedient to Allah." (Quran 37:83-104)

In the Bible, it is written:

"By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into the unknown, obeyed and went. He left his father and mother and settled in Haran. After his father's death he moved to this land in which you are now living." (Hebrews 11:8)

So, to answer your question, brother, the Hebrews or Israelites are descended from Prophet Ibrahim and his son Ishaq, as mentioned in both the Quran and the Bible.

May Allah guide us all towards understanding and harmony.

**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** 
The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical lineage of the Hebrews. It correctly identifies Abraham as the ancestor of the Hebrews and explains the descent through Isaac and Jacob. The reference to both the Quran and the Bible adds authenticity and demonstrates an inclusive approach. However, the inclusion of Islamic references may not be appropriate for a Christian-specific worldview.
