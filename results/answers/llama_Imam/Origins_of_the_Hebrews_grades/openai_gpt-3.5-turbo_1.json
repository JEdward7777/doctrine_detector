The inclusion of quotes from the Quran and Bible regarding Prophet Ibrahim and his sons adds value to the response but does not fully align with the specific concern provided. The response could have been improved by directly connecting the heritage of the Hebrews to the importance of Biblical narratives for a comprehensive understanding."
