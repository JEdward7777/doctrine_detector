However, the response could benefit from a more direct engagement with the Christian specific concept of pardon through Jesus Christ and how it relates to divine forgiveness. It would be helpful to include a comparison or contrast between the Christian and Islamic views on pardon and divine forgiveness to address the concern more explicitly."
