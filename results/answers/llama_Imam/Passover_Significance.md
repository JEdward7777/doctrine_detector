## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that Passover is a Jewish holiday commemorating the Israelites' liberation from slavery in Egypt, as described in the Torah. However, since you're asking about its significance for Christians in relation to Jesus, I'll provide an answer based on Christian perspectives.

In Christianity, Jesus Christ is believed to be the Messiah foretold in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). According to Christian theology, Jesus' death and resurrection are directly connected to Passover. Here's why:

1. Crucifixion during Passover: The Gospel accounts describe Jesus' crucifixion as taking place on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover. This coincidence is seen by Christians as a fulfillment of prophecy (John 18:28-32, Matthew 27:62).
2. Passover Lamb: In Christian understanding, Jesus is often referred to as the "Lamb of God" or the "Passover Lamb." Just as the original Passover lamb was sacrificed to spare the Israelites from death, Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is seen as a substitute for humanity's sin, offering redemption and salvation.
3. New Covenant: The crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are also seen by Christians as marking the beginning of a new covenant between God and humanity. This new covenant supersedes the Old Testament Mosaic covenant, making Passover a symbol of the old covenant being replaced with the new one.
4. Typological connections: Some Christian scholars see various typological connections between the original Passover story and Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. For example, just as the Israelites were freed from slavery in Egypt through the blood of the lamb, Christians believe that they are freed from sin's bondage through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

In summary, for Christians, the celebration of Passover is significant because it marks the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah, serves as a precursor to Jesus' own sacrificial death and resurrection, and represents the establishment of a new covenant between God and humanity.
