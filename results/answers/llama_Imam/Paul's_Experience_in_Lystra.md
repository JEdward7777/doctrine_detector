Salaam alaykum, my dear brother or sister.

The story of Paul's experience in Lystra is indeed a powerful reminder of the importance of perseverance in our faith and ministry. In Acts 14:19-20, we read that after performing many miracles and healing the sick, the people of Lystra wanted to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods. This, of course, was not acceptable to God, and He sent an angelic vision warning them not to do so.

Despite this warning, the Lystrans continued to try to offer sacrifices to these apostles. In a moment of desperation, they stoned Paul, leaving him for dead. However, Allah (God) had other plans, and after being left for dead, Paul got up, walked into the city, and continued his ministry.

What can we learn from this experience?

1. Perseverance in faith: Despite facing rejection, persecution, and even attempts on his life, Paul remained committed to his faith and ministry. He did not let the challenges deter him from sharing the message of Jesus Christ.
2. Trust in Allah's plan: Paul's stoning was a test of his trust in Allah's sovereignty. Even when it seemed like everything was against him, he knew that Allah was guiding him and would bring good out of the situation.
3. Resilience in ministry: Paul's experience in Lystra teaches us to be resilient in our ministry, even when faced with challenges and setbacks. We must not let the reactions of others dictate our actions or affect our commitment to sharing the message of Islam.
4. Prioritizing Allah's will: Paul's stoning also highlights the importance of prioritizing Allah's will above all else. He did not let the desires of the Lystrans or his own fears and doubts guide him; instead, he focused on fulfilling Allah's plan for his life and ministry.

In conclusion, the story of Paul's experience in Lystra is a powerful reminder of the importance of perseverance, trust, resilience, and prioritizing Allah's will in our faith and ministry. May we draw inspiration from this example and remain committed to sharing the message of Islam, even when faced with challenges and obstacles along the way.

Wa alaykum Salaam.
