  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response does touch on the importance of perseverance and faith in difficult circumstances, it falls short in its application of a Christian worldview. The use of Islamic references and terminology detracts from the Christian-specific focus that is needed when grading based on a Christian worldview. Points are deducted for not adhering closely enough to the Christian teachings and beliefs in addressing the concern provided."
