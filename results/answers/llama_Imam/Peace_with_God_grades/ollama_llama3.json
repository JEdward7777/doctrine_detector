The response primarily focuses on Muslim perspectives and does not address or discuss the concept of Jesus' sacrifice as central to achieving peace with God, as stated in the given answer. To better align with the concern, future responses should provide thoughtful consideration of the role of faith in the lives of Christians and engage with the idea that faith in Jesus' sacrifice is a means by which individuals can reconcile their estrangement caused by sin and achieve peace with God."
