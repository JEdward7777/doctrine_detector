  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough comparison between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding purification from sin. However, the student's response focused more on the differences between the two faiths rather than addressing the personal implications of purification for a Christian. The answer lacked a clear connection to how being made pure affects one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living from a Christian perspective. The student accurately explained the Christian belief in Jesus' sacrifice for sin but did not delve deeply into the transformative nature of this experience for the individual believer within their faith."
