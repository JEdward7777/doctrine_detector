However, it lacks depth in addressing the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living, which is a key concern in Christian theology. More insight into the transformative nature of purification and its impact on living a holy life would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
