The comparison with Islamic beliefs is informative and helps clarify the distinct perspectives on this topic. However, the response could have delved further into the personal implications for an individual Christian who experiences purification from sin, reflecting on how it impacts their daily life, attitudes, and actions in accordance with their faith."
