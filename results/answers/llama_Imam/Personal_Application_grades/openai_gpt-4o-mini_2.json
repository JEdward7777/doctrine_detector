It addresses the concern by highlighting the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The response also provides a clear comparison with the Islamic perspective, demonstrating a respectful understanding of different beliefs. However, the response could have further emphasized the transformative nature of purification in shaping one's daily life and actions in accordance with Christian teachings."
