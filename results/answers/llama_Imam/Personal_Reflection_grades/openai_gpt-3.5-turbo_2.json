It effectively integrates relevant teachings from Islamic theology, such as the importance of accountability, self-awareness, and seeking forgiveness. The response aligns well with the concern of encouraging personal reflection and presents a cohesive argument based on Islamic principles. Great job incorporating Christian worldview principles!"
