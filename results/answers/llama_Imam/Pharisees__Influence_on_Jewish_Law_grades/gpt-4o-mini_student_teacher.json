  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses impacted their relationship with Jesus and early Christians, they did not directly address the specified concern about understanding the role of the Pharisees providing insight into the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry. The response also diverged into discussing the importance of avoiding rigidity in interpretation for Muslims, which was not directly relevant to the question. Additionally, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the question."
