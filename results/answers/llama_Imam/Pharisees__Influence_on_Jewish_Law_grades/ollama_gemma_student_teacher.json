The student provides a well-reasoned analysis of how their focus on external purity and ritual correctness blinded them to the spiritual dimensions of faith. The inclusion of insights from Islamic tradition adds an interesting comparative perspective. Overall, this is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter."
