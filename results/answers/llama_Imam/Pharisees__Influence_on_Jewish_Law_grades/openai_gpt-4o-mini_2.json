The analysis draws parallels between the Pharisees' focus on external observance and Jesus' emphasis on the spiritual aspects of faith, effectively demonstrating how this conflict played out in the context of Jesus' ministry. The response also offers a valuable reflection for Muslims on the dangers of becoming overly rigid in religious interpretation. However, to enhance the Christian-specific worldview, it would be beneficial to incorporate more references to biblical passages or teachings that directly address the Pharisees' attitude and interactions with Jesus."
