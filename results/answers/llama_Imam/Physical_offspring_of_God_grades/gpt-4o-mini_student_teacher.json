  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and respectful explanation of the term \"Son of God\" from both a Muslim and Christian perspective. They offer valuable suggestions for clarifying the term, such as contextualizing its usage in Christian theology and exploring biblical terminology. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the specific teaching to address the concern directly. The student could have reinforced the importance of teaching that the term 'Son of God' refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, rather than physical procreation, which was the primary focus of the concern. Improving the alignment with the reference answer's teaching point would strengthen the student's response."
