The suggestions for contextualizing, understanding biblical terminology, exploring Christian doctrine, engaging in interfaith dialogue, and considering Islamic-Christian parallels are all relevant and helpful. The only slight deduction is that the response could have emphasized more explicitly the importance of upholding the unique Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus Christ in relation to this teaching."
