  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of properly teaching that the term \"Son of God\" refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation. It also highlights the significance of retaining biblical terminology in order to prevent doctrinal errors. The suggestions provided align well with a Christian worldview and encourage respectful dialogue and understanding between Muslims and Christians. The response could have been strengthened by further elaborating on specific biblical passages that support the concept of Jesus as the Son of God in a non-physical sense."
