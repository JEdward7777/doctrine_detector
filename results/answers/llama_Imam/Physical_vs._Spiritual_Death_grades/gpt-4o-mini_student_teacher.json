  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer does not align with the Christian worldview on the distinction between physical death and spiritual \"perishing.\" The response focuses on Islamic beliefs and teachings, rather than emphasizing the essential Christian understanding that spiritual \"perishing\" entails eternal separation from God for those who do not trust in Jesus. The student should have provided a perspective grounded in Christian theology and Biblical references to accurately address the concern provided."
