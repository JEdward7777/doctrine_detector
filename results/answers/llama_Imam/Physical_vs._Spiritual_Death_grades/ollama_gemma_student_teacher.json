The explanation is thorough and well-articulated, referencing relevant Quranic verses and hadiths. The student clearly explains that physical death is a natural part of life, while spiritual perishing is the result of one's choices and actions. The student's conclusion emphasizes the importance of spiritual growth and development through obedience to Allah's guidance and the adoption of good deeds. However, the response could benefit from acknowledging the Christian perspective on spiritual perishing, specifically referencing the role of faith in salvation."
