It effectively addresses the concern by clearly differentiating between physical death and spiritual perishing within an Islamic framework. However, the response could further enhance its clarity by integrating the idea that eternal consequences for spiritual perishing in Islam are linked to disobedience to Allah, similar to the concern raised regarding the importance of trusting in Jesus for spiritual life."
