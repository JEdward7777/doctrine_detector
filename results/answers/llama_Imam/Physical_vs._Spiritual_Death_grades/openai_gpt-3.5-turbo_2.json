The differentiation between physical death and spiritual perishing is well articulated and supported by relevant Islamic beliefs. However, it does not directly address the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding from a Christian perspective. Incorporating a comparison with the Christian view of spiritual death and the necessity of trusting in Jesus for eternal salvation would have strengthened the response further."
