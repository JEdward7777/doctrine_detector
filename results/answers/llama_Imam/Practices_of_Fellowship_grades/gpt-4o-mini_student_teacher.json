  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response detailing how early Christians expressed their fellowship, drawing parallels to Islamic practices as well. However, the student did not directly address the concern of how recognizing these practices can help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other. The answer provided valuable insights but lacked a direct application to the modern Christian context."
