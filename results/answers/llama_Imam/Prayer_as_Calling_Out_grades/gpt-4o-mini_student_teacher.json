  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful response from an Islamic perspective, highlighting the importance of calling out to Allah in prayer with humility, seeking guidance, expressing gratitude, and seeking forgiveness. While the student's answer beautifully explains the concept in Islamic tradition, it does not directly align with the Christian worldview. The Christian-specific interpretation would focus more on seeking urgent help, trusting in God, and depending on Him, as stated in the reference answer. The response could have been improved by incorporating Christian beliefs and practices related to prayer and dependence on God in daily life."
