Assalamu alaikum, dear brother or sister.

In Islam, we believe that all children of Adam are equal in the eyes of Allah (SWT), regardless of their lineage or biological ties. However, I understand your question is referring to the Christian concept of adoption as sons and daughters of God.

According to Romans 8:14-15, adopted children of God receive several privileges:

1. They are considered heirs to eternal life (Romans 8:17). This means that they have a guaranteed place in Paradise, where they will live forever with Allah (SWT).
2. They are given the Holy Spirit as a guarantee or down payment on their inheritance (2 Corinthians 1:22, Ephesians 1:14). The Holy Spirit guides and empowers them to live a life pleasing to Allah (SWT).
3. They have access to God through faith (Romans 8:15-17). This means that they can approach Allah (SWT) at any time, without fear or shame, and receive forgiveness, guidance, and comfort.
4. They are justified and made righteous in the eyes of Allah (SWT), not because of their own efforts, but because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross (Romans 8:1-2).
5. They are given the right to cry "Abba! Father!" indicating a deep intimacy and familiarity with Allah (SWT) (Romans 8:15).

While these privileges may not be explicitly mentioned in Islamic scriptures, we Muslims believe that all human beings have a special status as creations of Allah (SWT), and that each person has the potential to develop a close relationship with Him through acts of obedience, worship, and spiritual practices.

In Islam, we believe that the concept of adoption or being "adopted" by Allah (SWT) is not applicable, as it is seen as a unique Christian doctrine. However, Muslims do believe in the idea of being chosen by Allah (SWT) for special tasks or roles in life, and that our relationship with Him can be strengthened through good deeds, prayers, and self-reflection.

I hope this answers your question, dear brother or sister. May Allah (SWT) guide us all to a deeper understanding of His mercy and wisdom.
