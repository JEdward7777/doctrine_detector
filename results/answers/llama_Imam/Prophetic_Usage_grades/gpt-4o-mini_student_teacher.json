  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in Biblical prophecies and connected it well to the Islamic context. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the term's significance and implications. However, the student's response could have been more focused on the specific concern of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context to better apply the scriptures today. Although the answer touched on historical context and spiritual interpretation, there was more emphasis on general explanations rather than direct application for today's context. Further insights into how understanding this term's prophetic nature can enhance modern interpretations and application of scripture would have strengthened the response."
