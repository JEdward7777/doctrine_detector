The discussion effectively ties in both the historical context and the prophetic nature of the term, demonstrating an understanding of how these prophecies can be applied today. One suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how Christians view the fulfillment of these prophecies in light of Christ's coming and the establishment of the new covenant."
