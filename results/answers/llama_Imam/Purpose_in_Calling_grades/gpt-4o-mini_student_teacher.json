  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided thoughtful guidance from an Islamic perspective, the answer deviates significantly from the Christian worldview provided in the reference answer.

The response did not align closely enough with the Christian-specific approach, hence the lower grade."
