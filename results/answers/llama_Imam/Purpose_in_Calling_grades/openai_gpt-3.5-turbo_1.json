It emphasizes seeking guidance through prayer, reflection, studying Quranic verses, and consulting with knowledgeable individuals, all grounded in Islamic principles. While the approach may differ slightly from the Christian-specific worldview, the core principles of seeking God's guidance, understanding one's strengths and passions, and serving others align with Christian beliefs. Great emphasis is placed on self-reflection, seeking wisdom, and service to humanity, which are all important elements in discerning and fulfilling God's purpose."
