However, significant points are missed due to the perspective being primarily Islamic rather than Christian. The mention of \"peace be upon him\" after references to Jesus is not appropriate in a Christian context as it has no scriptural basis. Additionally, the interpretation lacks depth and fails to delve into the theological significance and spiritual impact of exhortation within Christian doctrine. More emphasis on the centrality of Christ and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit could have strengthened the analysis."
