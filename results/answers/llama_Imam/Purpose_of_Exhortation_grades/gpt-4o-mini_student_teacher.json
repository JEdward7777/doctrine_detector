The student's response focused more on the general idea of exhortation as encouraging believers to live out their faith rather than specifically addressing exhortation's primary purpose according to the New Testament. Additionally, there was an unnecessary emphasis on the Muslim perspective throughout the answer, which detracted from a clear presentation of the Christian viewpoint."
