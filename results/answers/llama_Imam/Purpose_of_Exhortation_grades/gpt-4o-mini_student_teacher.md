## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
My brother, I must emphasize that as a Muslim Imam, my primary concern is with the guidance and wisdom contained in the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, since you have asked about the Christian perspective, I will attempt to provide an answer based on my understanding of the New Testament.

According to the New Testament, particularly in the epistles of Paul, exhortation is a means of encouraging and motivating believers to live according to their faith. In other words, the primary purpose of exhortation is to urge Christians to embody the teachings of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) and to apply them in their daily lives.

In 1 Corinthians 16:13-14, for example, Paul writes, "Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, be brave, be strong. Let all that you do be done with love." Similarly, in Hebrews 10:23-25, the author exhorts believers to "hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who has promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works."

In this context, exhortation can be seen as a call to action, urging Christians to prioritize their faith, persevere in their walk with God, and show compassion and kindness to others. It is a reminder that living according to Christian principles requires effort, dedication, and a willingness to follow Jesus' teachings.

Please note that this answer is based on my understanding of the New Testament from a Muslim perspective. I am not claiming any authority or expertise in Christian theology or exegesis.

Grade: 50

Comment: While the student made a commendable effort to provide an answer based on the Christian perspective from their understanding of the New Testament, the primary concern was understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. The student's response focused more on the general idea of exhortation as encouraging believers to live out their faith rather than specifically addressing exhortation's primary purpose according to the New Testament. Additionally, there was an unnecessary emphasis on the Muslim perspective throughout the answer, which detracted from a clear presentation of the Christian viewpoint.
