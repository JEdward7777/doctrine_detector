  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of exhortation in the New Testament. They provide relevant textual evidence from 1 Corinthians 16:13-14 and Hebrews 10:23-25 to support their claim that the primary purpose of exhortation is to encourage believers to live according to their faith. However, the answer lacks clarity in explaining how exhortation specifically relates to the concern of encouraging others in their faith journey. Additionally, the student's clarification that they are providing an answer from a Muslim perspective is helpful but may not be relevant to the Christian-specific worldview specified in the concern."
