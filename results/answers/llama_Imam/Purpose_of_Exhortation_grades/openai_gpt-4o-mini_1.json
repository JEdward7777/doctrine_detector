It effectively addresses the concern by explaining how exhortation in Christianity serves to urge believers to embody the teachings of Jesus Christ and live according to their faith. The integration of Muslim perspective adds a unique perspective, demonstrating respect for the Christian worldview while offering insights from a different religious tradition. The response could have further emphasized the role of exhortation in building up the body of believers and fostering community growth, but overall, it presents a thoughtful interpretation from a different religious perspective."
