  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does provide some insight into what it means to live a life pleasing to God from an Islamic perspective, and it acknowledges the importance of following one's faith tradition in achieving righteousness. However, the response does not directly address the concern about the practical application of holiness in a believer's life, instead focusing on a more general discussion of righteousness and its various manifestations across different faith traditions.\n\nAdditionally, while the response does acknowledge the concept of apostleship in Christianity, it could have delved deeper into how Christians are specifically called to live holy lives. The original answer provided some insight into this, but the response did not engage with those ideas in a meaningful way.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and shows an appreciation for the diversity of faith traditions, but it could have more directly addressed the concern about practical application of holiness in a believer's life."
