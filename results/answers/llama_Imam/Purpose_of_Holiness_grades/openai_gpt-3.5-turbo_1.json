While the response did not directly address the Christian perspective of living holy lives per the given answer, it respectfully conveyed similarities and differences between the two faith traditions. The discussion on prophets and guidance, as well as the concept of apostleship in Christianity, added to the depth of the response, but it could have directly connected these elements to the practical application of holiness in a believer's life."
