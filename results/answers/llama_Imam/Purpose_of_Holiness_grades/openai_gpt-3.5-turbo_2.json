However, the focus primarily on Islamic beliefs and practices somewhat detracts from directly addressing the Christian perspective provided in the answer. It would have been more beneficial to directly compare and contrast the Christian concept of holiness with the Islamic perspective rather than mainly elaborating on Islamic beliefs. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a respectful approach to discussing faith traditions."
