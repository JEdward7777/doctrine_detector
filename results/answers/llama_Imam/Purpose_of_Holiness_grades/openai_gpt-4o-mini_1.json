It offers insight into the concept of righteousness in Islam and acknowledges the Christian perspective on holiness. However, although the response is well-written and informative, it strays somewhat from addressing the practical application of holiness in a believer's life as required per the concern. A more direct connection to practical examples or steps for living a holy life based on the Christian faith would have strengthened the response."
