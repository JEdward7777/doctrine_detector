While the response does not directly address the concept of holiness in Christianity mentioned in the provided answer, it effectively explores the Islamic perspective on living a righteous life. However, the focus on Islamic practices and beliefs, while informative, may detract slightly from addressing the Christian-specific concern raised. The comparison between Islamic and Christian beliefs on righteousness could have been more concise to better align with the specific Christian worldview highlighted in the answer provided."
