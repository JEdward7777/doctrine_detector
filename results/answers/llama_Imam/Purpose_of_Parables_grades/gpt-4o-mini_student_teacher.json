  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding Jesus as a prophet and the significance of his teachings, the answer did not directly address the primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings as stated in the reference answer. The student's response focused more on the broader context of prophethood, storytelling in religious teachings, and the importance of seeking knowledge and understanding spiritual truths in Islam.\n\nThe student did acknowledge the role of parables in conveying moral lessons and spiritual truths, which aligns with the Christian perspective that Jesus used parables to reveal truths to his disciples while concealing them from unbelievers. However, the student's response lacked the specificity and centrality of this aspect in explaining the primary purpose of Jesus using parables.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of religious teachings and spiritual guidance, but the deviation from directly addressing the question in the context of Christian beliefs warrants a lower grade."
