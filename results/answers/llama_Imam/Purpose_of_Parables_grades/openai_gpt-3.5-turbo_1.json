It addresses the concern by highlighting how Jesus used parables to convey spiritual truths, emphasizing the importance of understanding and reflecting on these teachings. The response appropriately acknowledges the differences in belief between Islam and Christianity, while still effectively discussing the teaching methods of Jesus. A Christian worldview would appreciate the recognition of Jesus as a significant figure in Islam, while also recognizing the distinct beliefs regarding his nature and teachings."
