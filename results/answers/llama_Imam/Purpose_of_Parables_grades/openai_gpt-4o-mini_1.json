It acknowledges the role of Jesus as a prophet in Islam and offers insights into the reasons behind Jesus' use of parables. The response effectively addresses the concern about understanding Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith. However, from a Christian worldview, the key difference lies in recognizing Jesus not just as a prophet but as the Son of God who came to reveal divine truths and salvation. While the response offers valuable perspectives, it falls short of fully aligning with a Christian specific worldview."
