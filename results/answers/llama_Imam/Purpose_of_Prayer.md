## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
I must clarify that the Bible is not a source of guidance for Muslims, as we follow the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, I can provide an answer from an Islamic perspective.

In Islam, prayer (Salah) has several purposes:

1. Establishing a connection with Allah: Prayer is a means to communicate with Allah, expressing devotion, gratitude, and seeking guidance.
2. Purification of the heart: Through prayer, one seeks to purify their heart from impurities, such as sin, selfishness, and ignorance.
3. Seeking forgiveness: Prayer provides an opportunity for Muslims to seek forgiveness for past mistakes and to make amends with Allah.
4. Strengthening faith: Regular prayer helps to strengthen a Muslim's faith, as it reminds them of Allah's greatness and their own limitations.
5. Requesting guidance and support: Prayer allows Muslims to ask for guidance in times of need, seeking wisdom from Allah to navigate life's challenges.
6. Expressing gratitude: Prayer provides an opportunity to express gratitude for the blessings one receives from Allah.
7. Seeking protection: In times of distress or uncertainty, prayer serves as a means to seek protection and refuge with Allah.

These purposes are not mutually exclusive with any biblical teachings on prayer. Muslims and Christians share commonalities in their understanding of prayer as a vital aspect of their relationship with the Divine.

However, it's essential to note that the Quranic understanding of prayer is distinct from the biblical context. For instance, Islam emphasizes the importance of physical postures (such as standing, bowing, and prostration) during prayer, whereas Christianity places more emphasis on inner devotion and spiritual connection.
