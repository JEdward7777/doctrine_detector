However, the student does not address the question directly in terms of the key purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible. Additionally, while it is important to highlight similarities, it is also crucial to acknowledge and explain the doctrinal differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs on prayer for a more comprehensive comparison. The response could have been improved by incorporating relevant biblical references and emphasizing the unique Christian understanding of prayer."
