While it does not directly address the concern of recognizing the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life, it does mention that prayer \"serves as a means to seek protection and refuge with Allah\" which is relevant to this concern.\n\nThe response also provides some interesting insights into the differences between Islamic and Christian understandings of prayer, particularly regarding physical postures during prayer.
