The response lacks specific references to the Christian understanding of the Psalms, such as their prophetic nature foretelling Christ, their role in Christian liturgy, and their significance in the New Testament. Additionally, the use of Islamic greetings and references may not be appropriate when discussing Christian worship practices. The answer would benefit from a more focused and thorough exploration of the Psalms within the Christian faith."
