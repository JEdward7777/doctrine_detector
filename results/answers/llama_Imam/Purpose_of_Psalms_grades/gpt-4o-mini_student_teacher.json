  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the role of Psalms in Jewish worship practices, highlighting their usage in various aspects of religious life. However, the student fails to address the specific concern of understanding the historical context and purpose of worship through Psalms. Additionally, the student's perspective from an Islamic viewpoint, while insightful, deviates from the Christian worldview that is the basis of this assessment."
