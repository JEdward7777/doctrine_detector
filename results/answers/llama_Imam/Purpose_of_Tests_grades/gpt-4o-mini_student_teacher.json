  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the purposes behind the tests that believers face according to Islamic beliefs. While the response highlights important aspects such as testing faith, developing patience, and revealing one's true nature, it lacks a clear emphasis on the primary Christian perspective of tests as a means to expose sin, prompt repentance, and deepen one's relationship with God. The student could improve the grade by incorporating more specific references to the Christian worldview on testing and sin."
