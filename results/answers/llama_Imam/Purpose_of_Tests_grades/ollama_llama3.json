  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the nature of tests in Islam, including their purposes such as testing one's faith, developing patience and perseverance, revealing one's true nature, guiding towards righteousness, building strength and resilience, and reminding us of our dependence on Allah (SWT). The response also provides relevant Quranic verses to support its points.\n\nHowever, it does not directly address the purpose of tests being to expose people's sin, help them turn away from sin, and draw closer to God, which is the main point of the provided answer. This means that the response does not fully align with the given answer, which is a significant concern.\n\nOverall, while the response is well-written and provides a thorough explanation of the nature of tests in Islam, it could be improved by more explicitly addressing the purpose of tests being to expose people's sin, help them turn away from sin, and draw closer to God."
