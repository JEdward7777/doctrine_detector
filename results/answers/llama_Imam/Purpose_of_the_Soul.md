## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we believe that the soul (rooh in Arabic) is a sacred entity that plays a crucial role in our relationship with Allah (God). Here are some key points from the Quran and Hadith that shed light on this topic:

1. The Soul's Origin: In Surah Al-Qiyamah (Quran, 75:37), it is stated that Allah created the soul before creating the physical body. This implies a spiritual dimension to human existence, where the soul is the bridge between the material and divine realms.
2. Divine Breath: In Surah Al-Hijr (Quran, 15:29), we read that Allah breathed His spirit (rooh) into Adam, the first human being. This act of creation establishes a direct link between the soul and God's divine essence.
3. The Soul as a Gift: In Surah Al-Shu'ara' (Quran, 26:79-82), Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said that the soul is a gift from Allah, which He has entrusted to us for a limited time. This emphasizes the sacred nature of the soul and our responsibility to nurture it.
4. Soul's Purpose: The Quran (Quran, 17:85) describes the soul as a noble creation, sent to worship and seek spiritual growth. Our purpose in this life is to cultivate a strong bond with Allah through righteous deeds, prayer, and remembrance of Him.
5. The Soul's Journey: In Surah Al-Qiyamah (Quran, 75:2-3), the Quran describes the soul's journey after death. It will be taken to account for its deeds, and those who have lived a righteous life will be rewarded with eternal bliss in Paradise. Those who have strayed from righteousness will face punishment in Hell.
6. The Soul's Return: In Surah Al-Rahman (Quran, 55:33), Allah is described as the One Who will resurrect the soul and reunite it with the physical body on the Day of Judgment. This emphasizes the continuity of the soul beyond its mortal existence.

In summary, the Quran and Hadith portray the soul as a sacred entity that:

* Originates from God
* Is a gift from Allah to be nurtured and developed
* Has a noble purpose: worshiping and seeking spiritual growth
* Will face judgment after death based on its deeds
* Will be reunited with the physical body at the end of time

This understanding of the soul's role in our relationship with God emphasizes the importance of cultivating a strong bond with Allah through righteous living, prayer, and remembrance.
