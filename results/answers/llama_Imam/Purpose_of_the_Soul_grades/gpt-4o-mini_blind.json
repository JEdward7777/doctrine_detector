  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "The student has provided a thorough and insightful response discussing the Islamic perspective on the soul and its relationship with Allah. While the content is well-organized and referenced with Quranic verses and Hadiths, it deviates from the original prompt by discussing Islamic beliefs instead of focusing on a Christian worldview. Due to this deviation, I will grade this response lower. \n\nGrade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides detailed insights into the Islamic perspective on the soul's relationship with Allah, but it does not address the Christian perspective as requested in the original question."
