  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful answer from an Islamic perspective regarding the soul's relationship with Allah. The content is well-researched and supported by references from the Quran and Hadith. However, since the concern specifically refers to the impact of recognizing the soul's role on a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions, the answer could have been more directly tied to how this understanding influences one's actions and choices in a practical sense. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong knowledge of Islamic beliefs regarding the soul's connection to Allah."
