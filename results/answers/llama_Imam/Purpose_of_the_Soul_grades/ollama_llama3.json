  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the soul's role in relation to God, as described in Islamic scriptures (Quran and Hadith). The author presents six key points that highlight the soul's origin, purpose, and journey after death, emphasizing its sacred nature and connection to Allah. The summary at the end effectively summarizes the main themes.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the concept of the soul to the concern about spiritual life and moral decisions. While the author mentions the importance of cultivating a strong bond with Allah through righteous living, prayer, and remembrance, they do not fully explore how this understanding of the soul can inform daily life choices.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could provide more concrete examples or practical applications of how recognizing the soul's role in relation to God can influence believers' spiritual lives and moral decisions."
