The inclusion of references to the Gospels and the theological implications in Christianity adds depth to the analysis. However, a slightly stronger connection could be made specifically to the rabbinic teaching present in the New Testament to further enhance the response. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern with a solid Christian worldview perspective."
