However, it lacks an explicit connection to the historical context and significance of the event in relation to the Israelites' exile, return, and the role of the Babylonians in the destruction. While the connection to Islamic beliefs is thorough, the focus strays away from addressing the explicit concern of understanding the historical context specific to the Temple's destruction and restoration."
