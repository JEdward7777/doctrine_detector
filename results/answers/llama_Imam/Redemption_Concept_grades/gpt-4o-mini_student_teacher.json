  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of redemption in both the Bible and Islam, demonstrating a good understanding of both concepts. However, the student's answer lacks a clear focus on the significance of redemption in Christian faith, which was the specified concern. Additionally, the response could have further emphasized the unique Christian belief that Jesus' sacrifice is the ultimate act of redemption for humanity's sins, as per the reference answer. The inclusion of Islamic perspectives added depth to the comparison, but the focus strayed from the Christian-specific worldview intended for this question."
