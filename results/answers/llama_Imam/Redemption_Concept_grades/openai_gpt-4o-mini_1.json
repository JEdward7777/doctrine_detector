However, the Christian significance of redemption is somewhat diluted by focusing equally on the Islamic perspective. While it acknowledges Jesus as the redeemer paying the price for human sins, it could have further emphasized the unique Christian belief in redemption through Christ's sacrifice as central to the Christian faith. Overall, a good analysis but lacking in clear emphasis on the Christian understanding of redemption."
