However, there is a lack of emphasis on the unique salvific significance of the Lord's Supper in Christian belief, specifically in proclaiming the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as a central tenet of faith. While the response respectfully highlights similarities and common values between the two faith traditions, it could have further emphasized the distinctiveness and doctrinal implications of the Lord's Supper in the Christian faith in response to the concern provided."
