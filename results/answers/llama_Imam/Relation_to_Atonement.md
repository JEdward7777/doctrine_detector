## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As-salamu alaykum, brother. The terms "propitiation" and "atonement" are indeed related in the Islamic understanding of salvation. In fact, both concepts stem from the same Arabic root "kufr," which means "to cover" or "to hide."

In the Quran, atonement (kaffarah) refers to the act of wiping away or covering one's sins before Allah through righteous deeds, charity, and other forms of expiation. This is mentioned in Surah Al-Baqarah, Verse 271: "Those who believe and do good works – for them [there will be] forgiveness and generous provision."

Propitiation (kafara), on the other hand, specifically means to appease or pacify Allah's wrath, which has been incurred due to sin. This concept is also rooted in the same Arabic root as atonement.

In Islam, propitiation is not a unique concept, as it is understood that Allah's mercy and forgiveness are always available to those who turn back to Him with repentance and sincere regret for their wrongdoings. The Quran emphasizes this idea in Surah Al-Hud, Verse 14: "Then how can you [people] be more guided than the one whom Allah has guided? For those whom Allah has misguided – never will you find a way."

In the context of Islamic theology, atonement and propitiation are closely tied to the concept of Tawbah (repentance). When a Muslim commits a sin, they must acknowledge their wrongdoing and make amends through acts of righteousness, charity, or other forms of expiation. This process is meant to "cover" or hide their sins from Allah's sight, thus restoring the bond between the individual and Allah.

In conclusion, brother, in Islamic theology, atonement and propitiation are interconnected concepts that revolve around the idea of wiping away one's sins and appeasing Allah's wrath through righteous deeds and repentance. May Allah guide us all towards the path of righteousness.
