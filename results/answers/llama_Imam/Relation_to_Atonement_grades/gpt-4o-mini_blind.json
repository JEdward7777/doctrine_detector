However, from a Christian perspective, there are significant doctrinal differences when it comes to the concepts of atonement and propitiation. The answer does not address the Christian understanding of these terms, which is essential for a comprehensive examination of the question. A stronger response would compare and contrast the Islamic and Christian viewpoints on atonement and propitiation."
