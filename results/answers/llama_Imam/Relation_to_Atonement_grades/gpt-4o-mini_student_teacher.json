  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic understanding of atonement and propitiation, which is informative. However, the student did not address the specific concern of clarifying the differences and similarities between these two theological terms from a Christian perspective. The response lacks a comparison with the reference answer, which significantly detracts from its relevance to the question asked."
