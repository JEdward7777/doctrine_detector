The student effectively clarifies the differences and similarities between these two important theological terms within an Islamic framework. However, a Christian-specific worldview perspective would have added value by contrasting these concepts with the Christian understanding of atonement and propitiation through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ to satisfy God's justice."
