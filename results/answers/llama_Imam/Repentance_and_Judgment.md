## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Islamic scholar, I must clarify that the Bible is not considered authoritative in Islam. However, for the sake of understanding and dialogue, I can provide an overview of the biblical perspective on repentance and God's wrath.

In the Bible, repentance (Hebrew: שוּב, shub; Greek: μετανόεια, metanoeō) is often linked with God's wrath. The concept of repentance implies a change of heart, turning away from sin and towards God (e.g., Luke 15:11-32). When individuals turn to God in repentance, they acknowledge their wrongdoing, accept responsibility for it, and seek forgiveness.

In this context, the Bible presents God as a just and merciful Judge. His wrath is often depicted as a consequence of humanity's disobedience and rebellion against His will (e.g., Romans 1:18-20). When individuals reject God's love and disregard His commands, they invite His wrath upon themselves (e.g., Matthew 3:7; John 3:36).

However, the Bible also emphasizes that repentance can avert or mitigate God's wrath. Through Jesus Christ, humans are offered forgiveness and salvation from sin's consequences (e.g., Isaiah 53:5; Acts 2:38). The Bible teaches that those who confess their sins and turn to God in repentance will be spared from His wrath and receive mercy (e.g., Psalm 32:1-5; Luke 15:11-32).

In Islamic theology, the concept of repentance (tawbah) is also crucial. Muslims believe that Allah is merciful and forgiving, but they also acknowledge His justice and wrath against those who reject or disobey Him. In Islam, repentance is seen as a means to return to a state of obedience and submission to Allah's will.

In conclusion, while I may not be familiar with the details of biblical theology, it seems that the Bible presents a complex relationship between repentance and God's wrath. Repentance can lead to forgiveness and salvation from sin's consequences, but rejection or disobedience can invite God's wrath. As an Islamic scholar, I recognize the importance of repentance in both Islamic and Christian traditions, and I believe that it is essential for individuals to turn to their respective divine authorities with humility and sincerity.
