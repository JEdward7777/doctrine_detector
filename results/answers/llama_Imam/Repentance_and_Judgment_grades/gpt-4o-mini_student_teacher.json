  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the biblical perspective on repentance and God's wrath, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more directly on the specific relationship between repentance and the wrath of God as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, while the student effectively compared Islamic and Christian perspectives on repentance, a deeper analysis of the Christian viewpoint would have further strengthened the response."
