## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that the concept of apostles or disciples in Islam is different from that in Christianity. In Islam, we believe that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent as a prophet and messenger by Allah, whereas in Christianity, Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) is considered to be the Son of God.

However, regarding your question about Judas Iscariot's replacement among the twelve apostles, according to Christian tradition, Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal. This selection took place as described in Acts 1:21-26.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)

Grade: 60

Comment: The response correctly identifies Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles according to Christian tradition. However, the initial clarification of the differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs, although informative, does not directly address the question being asked, which could have been considered as a digression from the main topic. Ensuring greater focus on directly answering the question would improve the overall response.
