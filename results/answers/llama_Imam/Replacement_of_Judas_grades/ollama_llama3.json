  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the respondent correctly identifies Matthias as the replacement for Judas Iscariot, their answer does not fully address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The original question asked about the replacement among the twelve apostles, but the respondent's focus on Judas' death and subsequent selection process (Acts 1:21-26) only partially addresses this concern.\n\nThe response could be improved by explicitly discussing how Matthias' selection maintains the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, rather than simply highlighting the process of his selection. Additionally, while the respondent's brief mention of Christian tradition is a good start, it would be helpful to further develop this point and explore its implications for understanding the nature of apostolic ministry.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates some understanding of the biblical narrative surrounding Judas' replacement, but could be strengthened by more directly addressing the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension."
