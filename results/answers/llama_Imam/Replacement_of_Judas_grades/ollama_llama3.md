## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that the concept of apostles or disciples in Islam is different from that in Christianity. In Islam, we believe that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent as a prophet and messenger by Allah, whereas in Christianity, Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) is considered to be the Son of God.

However, regarding your question about Judas Iscariot's replacement among the twelve apostles, according to Christian tradition, Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal. This selection took place as described in Acts 1:21-26.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the respondent correctly identifies Matthias as the replacement for Judas Iscariot, their answer does not fully address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The original question asked about the replacement among the twelve apostles, but the respondent's focus on Judas' death and subsequent selection process (Acts 1:21-26) only partially addresses this concern.

The response could be improved by explicitly discussing how Matthias' selection maintains the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, rather than simply highlighting the process of his selection. Additionally, while the respondent's brief mention of Christian tradition is a good start, it would be helpful to further develop this point and explore its implications for understanding the nature of apostolic ministry.

Comment: The response demonstrates some understanding of the biblical narrative surrounding Judas' replacement, but could be strengthened by more directly addressing the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.
