## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that the concept of apostles or disciples in Islam is different from that in Christianity. In Islam, we believe that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent as a prophet and messenger by Allah, whereas in Christianity, Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) is considered to be the Son of God.

However, regarding your question about Judas Iscariot's replacement among the twelve apostles, according to Christian tradition, Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal. This selection took place as described in Acts 1:21-26.

Comment: The response accurately reflects the Christian belief regarding Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles. It demonstrates an understanding of the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension within a Christian worldview. The only minor deduction is due to the initial mention of Islamic beliefs, which, while informative, is not directly relevant to the concern at hand.
