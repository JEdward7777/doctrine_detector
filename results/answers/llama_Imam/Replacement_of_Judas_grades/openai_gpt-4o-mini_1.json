The response also acknowledges the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, demonstrating an understanding of the significance of this event within Christianity. The reference to Acts 1:21-26 provides additional support for the information given. Overall, this is a well-informed and appropriately detailed response from a Muslim perspective."
