  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The response correctly identifies that the information provided in the question is not found in Islamic sources and provides a brief explanation of the Islamic perspective on the crucifixion of Jesus. However, the response lacks a direct answer to the question regarding Peter's address to the crowd in the context of Christianity. More focus on addressing the specific question from a Christian perspective would improve the grade."
