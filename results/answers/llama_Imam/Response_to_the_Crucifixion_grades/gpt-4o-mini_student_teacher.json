  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student did not address the specific question about how Peter addressed the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion, nor did they engage with the concern about evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel. Instead, the student provided information about Islamic beliefs related to Jesus' crucifixion. The response lacked relevance and did not demonstrate an understanding of the Christian-specific context of the question."
