## Question [Response to the Crucifixion](../../../questions/Response_to_the_Crucifixion.md)
In what way did Peter address the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion?

## Correct Answer
Peter pointedly states that the crowd collectively crucified Jesus but emphasizes that God raised Him to life, stressing the need for repentance and faith.

## Stated Concern
Evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel.

## [Answer](../Response_to_the_Crucifixion.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As-salamu alaykum,

I must correct you that there is no evidence in the Quran or Islamic tradition that mentions Peter addressing the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. The Quran only briefly mentions the story of Jesus' (peace be upon him) crucifixion, stating:

"And behold! Allah will say: 'O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor unto you and unto your mother when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit in order that you spoke to the people from the cradle as a messenger...' Then will Allah speak to him and raise him up unto Himself; And will make the disbelievers witness how they will be tormented." (Quran 3:45)

The crucifixion of Jesus is not considered an important event in Islamic theology, as Muslims believe that Jesus was raised alive to heaven by God and did not die on the cross. Instead, it was a substitute, like Prophet Abraham's (peace be upon him) sacrifice of a ram instead of his son Ismail.

If you're referring to Peter's address regarding the crucifixion in the context of Christianity, I'd be happy to help clarify any misunderstandings or provide insight into the Islamic perspective on this topic.

**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 

The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of Islamic theology regarding the crucifixion of Jesus and correctly points out that it is not central to Islamic belief. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on Peter's address to the crowd in the context of Christianity, as it was not the focus of the original question. Additionally, the response could have addressed the concern related to evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel.
