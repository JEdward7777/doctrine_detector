However, the response focuses more on correcting Islamic beliefs and does not address the concern of evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel from a Christian worldview. It misses the opportunity to delve deeper into the significance of Peter's message in the context of spreading the gospel and calling for a response to the core tenets of Christianity."
