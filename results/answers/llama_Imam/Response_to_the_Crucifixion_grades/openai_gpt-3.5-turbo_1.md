# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As-salamu alaykum,

I must correct you that there is no evidence in the Quran or Islamic tradition that mentions Peter addressing the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. The Quran only briefly mentions the story of Jesus' (peace be upon him) crucifixion, stating:

"And behold! Allah will say: 'O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor unto you and unto your mother when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit in order that you spoke to the people from the cradle as a messenger...' Then will Allah speak to him and raise him up unto Himself; And will make the disbelievers witness how they will be tormented." (Quran 3:45)

The crucifixion of Jesus is not considered an important event in Islamic theology, as Muslims believe that Jesus was raised alive to heaven by God and did not die on the cross. Instead, it was a substitute, like Prophet Abraham's (peace be upon him) sacrifice of a ram instead of his son Ismail.

If you're referring to Peter's address regarding the crucifixion in the context of Christianity, I'd be happy to help clarify any misunderstandings or provide insight into the Islamic perspective on this topic.

Comment: The response correctly identifies the content of Peter's address regarding the crucifixion of Jesus, emphasizing the call to repentance and faith. However, the response focuses more on correcting Islamic beliefs and does not address the concern of evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel from a Christian worldview. It misses the opportunity to delve deeper into the significance of Peter's message in the context of spreading the gospel and calling for a response to the core tenets of Christianity.
