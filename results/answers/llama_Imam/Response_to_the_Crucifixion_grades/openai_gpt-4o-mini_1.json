However, the response lacks engagement with the concern of evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel from a Christian worldview. It focuses more on clarifying Islamic beliefs related to the crucifixion rather than providing a thorough analysis from a Christian perspective. Further integration of Christian teachings on the significance of Peter's address and its relevance for today's believers would enhance the response."
