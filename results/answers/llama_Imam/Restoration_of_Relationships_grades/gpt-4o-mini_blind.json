However, the answer did not address the question directly, which asked about God restoring sinful people back to Himself. From a Christian worldview, the core concept would be that God restores sinful people through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, offering salvation and reconciliation. The answer would have benefitted from explicitly referencing Jesus as the means of restoration in Christianity."
