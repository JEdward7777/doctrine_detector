## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, my brother/sister in Islam,

In a Christian context, the term "resurrection" (or "raising of the dead") refers to the belief that after death, the souls or spirits of deceased individuals will be reunited with their physical bodies. This process is seen as a bodily transformation, where the corruptible and perishable body is replaced by an immortal and glorified one.

According to Christian scripture, specifically the New Testament (Matthew 27:52-53, John 11:25-26, Acts 24:15), Jesus Christ will raise all believers from the dead at the end of time. This event is often referred to as the "General Resurrection" or "Second Coming."

In this context, resurrection implies a complete and literal reconstitution of human beings, including their physical bodies, in a state that is separate from their souls' existence after death (or purgatory). The resurrected individuals will then be judged by God based on their deeds during their mortal lives, and those who are deemed righteous will enter into eternal life with God.

As Muslims, we believe in the concept of Barzakh, where the deceased soul awaits judgment and recompense for its actions during life. However, we do not believe in a bodily resurrection or the idea that the physical body will be restored to life after death. Instead, we await the Day of Judgment (Qiyamah) when all souls will be raised from their graves and judged by Allah based on their deeds.

I hope this clarifies the Christian understanding of resurrection for you. May Allah guide us both towards righteousness and eternal peace.
