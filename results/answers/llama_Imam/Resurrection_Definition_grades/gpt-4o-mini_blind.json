  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student has provided a detailed explanation of the concept of resurrection in a Christian context, referencing relevant scriptures and beliefs. However, the response falls short in doctrinal correctness. The student has intermingled Islamic beliefs with Christian beliefs, which could potentially confuse or mislead the reader. The comparison and contrast with Islamic beliefs are not necessary for answering the question, and the focus should have been solely on Christian teachings regarding resurrection. The student's understanding of Christian resurrection lacks clarity and accuracy, with significant theological errors. A more focused and accurate explanation of Christian beliefs on resurrection is needed for a higher grade."
