However, it lacks a strong emphasis on the central Christian doctrine of atonement through Jesus Christ and the necessity of repentance for reconciliation with God. The explanation on how God's wrath can be reconciled with His loving nature is somewhat vague and could benefit from more specific references to key Christian teachings."
