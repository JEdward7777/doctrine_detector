  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 50.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective and made an effort to draw parallels with Christian theology, the answer ultimately deviated significantly from addressing the concern provided. The student focused more on comparative religious perspectives and lacked a thorough exploration of how God's attributes coexist without contradiction in Biblical teaching, as requested. Additionally, the response did not fully align with a Christian specific worldview, as it primarily presented an Islamic viewpoint. The student's answer failed to directly address how Christians reconcile God's wrath with His loving and merciful nature within the context of Biblical teaching. Overall, the response lacked depth and relevance to the specific concern raised."
