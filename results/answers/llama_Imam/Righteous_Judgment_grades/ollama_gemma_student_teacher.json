  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the theological concepts of God's wrath and love from both Islamic and Christian perspectives. The response successfully reconciles the two concepts by highlighting the context of human rebellion, divine justice, and the sacrificial love of Jesus Christ. The student's ability to articulate the relationship between these concepts and provide relevant scriptural references earns a high grade."
