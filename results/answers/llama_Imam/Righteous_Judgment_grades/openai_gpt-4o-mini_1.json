It acknowledges the differences in theological views while emphasizing the coexistence of God's attributes without contradiction in Biblical teaching. The integration of verses from the Quran and the Bible, alongside explanations of divine justice, mercy, and the sacrificial love of Jesus Christ, demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful approach to exploring the topic. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern raised while incorporating a Christian-specific worldview. Great job!"
