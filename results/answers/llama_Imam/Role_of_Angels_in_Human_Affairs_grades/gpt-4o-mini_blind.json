  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of how angels serve God according to both biblical references and Islamic beliefs. It accurately discusses key roles such as messengers, intercessors, protectors, and worshipers in both Christian and Islamic perspectives. However, since the question specifically requested biblical references, the emphasis on Quranic references in the explanation reduces the grade slightly. Additionally, while acknowledging the similarities between Christianity and Islam on the role of angels is helpful, the answer could have delved deeper into the unique aspects of angelic service within a Christian worldview."
