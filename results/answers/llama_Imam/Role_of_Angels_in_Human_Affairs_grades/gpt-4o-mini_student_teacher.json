  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80.\n\nWhile the student's response provides a thorough comparison of the roles of angels in both Christianity and Islam, they focused more on Islamic beliefs rather than addressing the specific biblical references outlined in the question. The answer includes detailed information about Islamic beliefs related to angels but lacks a direct connection to the biblical references requested in the question. Additionally, the student did not directly address the concern regarding how understanding the roles of angels can impact Christian perceptions of divine intervention. A more focused approach on the biblical references and their implications for Christian beliefs would have improved the answer."
