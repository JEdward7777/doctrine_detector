Assalamu alaikum (peace be upon you).

As an Islamic scholar, I must clarify that the concept of angels is not unique to Christianity or Judaism, but also plays a significant role in Islam. However, since you've asked about biblical references, I'll provide some insight based on the Quranic understanding.

According to the Bible and Christian traditions, angels serve God in various ways:

1. Messengers: Angels are often referred to as messengers of God, conveying His messages to humanity (Matthew 2:13, Luke 1:26-38).
2. Intercessors: Some biblical accounts depict angels interceding on behalf of humans before God's throne (Job 33:23-24, Daniel 10:12-14).
3. Protectors: Angels are believed to be guardians and protectors of individuals, nations, or specific places (Psalm 91:11-12, Matthew 18:10).
4. Worshipers: The Bible mentions angels worshiping God, acknowledging His glory and majesty (Isaiah 6:2-3, Revelation 5:11-14).

In Islam, we believe that angels are created from light ( Nur ) by Allah (God), and their primary function is to carry out the commands of Allah. Some key roles of angels in Islamic tradition include:

1. Messengers: Like the Christian understanding, Islamic prophets were also messengers of God, but with a focus on conveying His will and guidance to humanity.
2. Record-keepers: According to the Quran (Surah Al-Mu'minoon 83), angels record the deeds of humans, including their good and bad actions.
3. Guardians: Islam teaches that angels are responsible for protecting believers from harm, both physically and spiritually.

While there may be some differences in understanding between Christianity and Islam, both traditions agree on the significance of angels as messengers, intercessors, protectors, and worshipers of God.

May Allah guide us all to understand and appreciate the role of angels in serving His divine will. Ameen (amen).
