  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive comparison of the roles of angels in Christianity and Islam, highlighting similarities and differences. It effectively addresses the concern by explaining how understanding these roles can impact Christians' perception of divine intervention. The response is well-informed, respectful of both faith traditions, and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective. Great job integrating both viewpoints within a Christian worldview context."
