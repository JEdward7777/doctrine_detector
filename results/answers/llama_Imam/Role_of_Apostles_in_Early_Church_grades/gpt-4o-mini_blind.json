The use of Islamic references and beliefs does not align with a Christian worldview, and it is important for the response to focus on the teachings of the apostles in the context of Christianity. Additionally, the references to Prophet Muhammad and Islamic concepts may be confusing for a Christian audience. A stronger emphasis on biblical examples and principles would greatly improve the response."
