  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers from a Christian worldview. The student provides relevant examples from the Quran and Sunnah to support their claims. The response is well-written and demonstrates a deep appreciation for the importance of community in Islam. However, the student could have elaborated more on the specific practices or methods used by the apostles to teach and foster community, which would have strengthened their overall argument."
