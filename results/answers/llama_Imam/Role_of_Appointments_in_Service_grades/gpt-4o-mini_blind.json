However, it fails to adequately address the distinct Christian theological foundation behind fulfilling these roles, such as the authority of Scripture, the role of Christ as the head of the Church, and the importance of the Holy Spirit's empowerment in fulfilling these roles. Greater emphasis on these doctrinal aspects would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview."
