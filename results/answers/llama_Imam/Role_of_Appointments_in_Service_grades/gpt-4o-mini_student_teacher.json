However, the answer primarily focuses on the similarities between Islam and Christianity rather than addressing the specific roles and responsibilities appointed to Christians in the Church. While the student touched on important aspects such as gifts, talents, stewardship, and spiritual growth, the answer could have been more focused and directly related to the Christian framework outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. A deeper analysis of Christian teachings and a more direct application to the specific roles within the Church would have strengthened the response."
