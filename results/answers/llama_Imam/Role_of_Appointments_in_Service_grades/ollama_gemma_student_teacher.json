  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical principles related to fulfilling roles within the Church. They provide clear explanations of the concepts of spiritual gifting, stewardship, and the importance of serving others. The inclusion of examples of specific roles further strengthens the response. However, the answer would benefit from a more direct connection to the specific concern stated in the prompt, which emphasizes the responsibility of believers in their appointed tasks and service within the body of Christ."
