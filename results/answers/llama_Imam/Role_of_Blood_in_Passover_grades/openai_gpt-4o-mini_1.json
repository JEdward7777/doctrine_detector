The response focuses more on the symbolic and historical interpretations from an Islamic viewpoint rather than exploring the Christian perspective on sacrifice and atonement. Consideration of the Christian beliefs on sacrifice and atonement is necessary for a comprehensive analysis from a Christian worldview."
