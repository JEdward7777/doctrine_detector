However, the response focused more on the Islamic perspective and the idea of God's wisdom in designing human beings, rather than directly addressing the concern of understanding the value and purpose of all individuals in society regardless of their physical or social status. The response could have been strengthened by directly connecting the role of eunuchs to God's plan for different individuals in society, as stated in the reference answer."
