  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does a good job of addressing the concern by emphasizing the inherent value and purpose of all individuals in God's kingdom, regardless of their physical or social status. It effectively uses Islamic teachings and principles to justify the role of eunuchs in ancient royal courts as part of God's plan for them. The analysis is well-supported with Quranic references and theological insights. However, the introduction of the response could have directly linked the discussion to the concern raised, providing a more focused and cohesive approach from the beginning. Additionally, a more concise and organized structure could have enhanced the overall readability of the response."
