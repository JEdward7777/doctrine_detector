However, the response does not fully address the concern of recognizing the significance of Jesus' divinity. It lacks a clear emphasis on Jesus being God himself, which is a central tenet of Christian belief. Additionally, the response could have included more scriptural references to support the argument and strengthen the explanation of Jesus' divinity."
