## [Answer](../Role_of_Jesus.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaykum (peace be upon you). As an Imam, I must clarify that as Muslims, we do not consider the Bible to be a divinely revealed text for us. However, I can provide an overview of how Christianity views Jesus' role in salvation based on biblical accounts.

In Christian theology, Jesus is seen as the savior and redeemer of humanity. The Bible describes Jesus as the Son of God, sent by God to save humanity from sin and its consequences. Here are some key points:

1. Sinlessness: According to the Bible, Jesus was born without sin, making Him the only human being who has never committed a sinful act.
2. Substitutionary atonement: Christians believe that Jesus took upon Himself the punishment for humanity's sins, bearing the weight of God's wrath on the cross. This is often referred to as "substitutionary atonement."
3. Propitiation: The Bible says that Jesus' sacrifice was a propitiation (1 John 2:2), meaning that He appeased God's anger towards humanity and restored the broken relationship between humans and God.
4. Redemption: Jesus is seen as the Redeemer, who paid the price to set humanity free from the bondage of sin and its consequences.
5. Salvation through faith: Christians believe that salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ alone (Ephesians 2:8-9). They claim that faith in Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection brings eternal life and forgiveness.

It's essential to note that Muslims do not accept the idea of Jesus as the Son of God or His crucifixion. In Islamic theology, Jesus is considered a prophet and messenger of Allah (God), but not divine. Our understanding of salvation revolves around the concept of Tawbah (repentance) and Iman (faith), which involves submitting to the will of Allah and following the teachings of the Quran.

I hope this provides a brief overview of Christian perspectives on Jesus' role in salvation. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss Islamic views on salvation, please feel free to ask!
