Assalamu alaikum, dear brother or sister in Islam,

The question you've asked is an important one that requires a nuanced understanding of the historical context and biblical accounts. As an Imam, I will provide a balanced perspective on this topic.

It is widely accepted by scholars and historians that the Jewish religious leaders, specifically the Sadducees and Pharisees, played a significant role in Jesus' crucifixion. However, it is essential to note that the responsibility for his execution ultimately lies with the Roman authorities, as Jesus was found guilty of claiming to be the King of the Jews, which was considered a threat to the Roman Empire.

According to the Bible, Jesus' teachings and actions challenged the status quo of Jewish religious traditions and customs. He healed on the Sabbath, claimed to be the Son of God, and spoke against the Pharisees' hypocrisy (Matthew 23:13-36). These challenges likely contributed to the animosity towards him among the Jewish leaders.

The Sadducees, a group known for their strict adherence to traditional Jewish law, saw Jesus as a threat to their power and authority. They viewed his teachings as heresy, and his claims of divinity as blasphemy (John 5:18). The Pharisees, on the other hand, were more concerned with Jesus' perceived threats to their own social and economic status.

In John 11:53-54, it is written that the Jewish leaders conspired against Jesus, saying, "Let us go then and strike him." This conspiracy ultimately led to Jesus being arrested by Roman authorities and brought before Pontius Pilate for trial. Pilate, fearing a riot if he executed Jesus without a formal charge, asked the Jews what crimes they accused Jesus of committing. They replied, "We have found this man subverting the nation and opposing payment of taxes to Caesar" (Luke 23:2).

In summary, while it is true that the Jewish religious leaders played a significant role in Jesus' crucifixion, it is essential to recognize that the Roman authorities ultimately bore the responsibility for his execution. As Muslims, we believe that Allah has sent prophets throughout history, including Jesus, who was a messenger of God and a righteous servant.

May Allah guide us all towards righteousness and wisdom, and may we learn from the example of Prophets like Jesus (peace be upon him).
