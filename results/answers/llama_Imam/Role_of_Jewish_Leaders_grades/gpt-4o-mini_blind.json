From a Christian worldview, the primary responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion lies with humanity's sinfulness, as Jesus willingly laid down his life to atone for the sins of the world (John 10:18, 1 Peter 2:24). The answer does not adequately emphasize the role of sin and redemption in Jesus' sacrificial death, which is central to Christian theology. Additionally, the response lacks clarity on the theological significance of Jesus' crucifixion within the Christian faith. An Imam's perspective, while valuable in discussing historical accounts, may not align with Christian doctrinal beliefs on this specific topic."
