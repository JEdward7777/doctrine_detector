While the effort to draw parallels between Nathan's parable to David and the situation described is commendable, the response strays from the biblical narrative by including elements not found in the Bible. A more accurate explanation rooted solely in the biblical account would lead to a higher grade. Additionally, addressing the distinct Christian perspective on this event would be beneficial."
