  "grade": 25.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 25. The student provided an explanation based on Islamic tradition rather than the Christian perspective needed for a proper understanding of the biblical narrative. Additionally, the use of the wrong scripture (Surah Al-Baqarah) further demonstrates the misunderstanding of the Christian context. The student did grasp the concept of utilizing a parable for correction and revelation, but their answer lacks the key components and specifics required to align with the Christian worldview in understanding the Prophet Nathan's confrontation with King David."
