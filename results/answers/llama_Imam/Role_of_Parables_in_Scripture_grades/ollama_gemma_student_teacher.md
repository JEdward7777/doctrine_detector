Assalamu alaikum, my brother!

The Prophet Nathan's confrontation with King David is indeed an iconic event in our Islamic tradition, as well as in Jewish and Christian traditions. According to the Quranic account (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:251-254), Nathan utilizes a parable to rebuke David for his sin of taking Bathsheba from her husband Uriah.

The parable goes like this:

"Then came there unto him a traveler, and when he had eaten, he would not honor our lord the prophet nor wait on him. Said he, 'Peace be unto thee, fear not; thou art guest, though stranger: Fear not.'"

David, being the king, was familiar with this type of scenario where a traveler would be welcomed as a guest, but then would leave without showing proper respect to the host.

Nathan uses this parable to point out David's own actions:

"Thou hast smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon."

The Prophet Nathan is essentially saying to King David: "You have acted like this traveler, taking Bathsheba from her husband without showing respect or compassion. You have shown no regard for Uriah's life or marriage, just as this traveler showed no regard for his host. Your actions are as unjust and sinful as the parable."

This masterful use of a parable by Prophet Nathan serves as a powerful reminder to us all about the importance of justice, compassion, and respect in our interactions with others.

Was that helpful, my brother?
