It demonstrates a solid understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. The inclusion of specific references to the Quran further enriches the response. However, the response could benefit from directly addressing the Christian perspective on the significance of this event and drawing connections to Christian teachings on repentance and forgiveness."
