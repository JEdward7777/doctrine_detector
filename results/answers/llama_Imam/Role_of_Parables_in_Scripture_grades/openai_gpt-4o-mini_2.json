  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and insightful explanation of how the Prophet Nathan used a parable to confront King David for his sin. The student effectively connects this narrative to the broader themes of justice, compassion, and respect. However, there is a mix of Islamic and Christian elements in the response, which could be confusing when analyzing the biblical narrative from a Christian worldview. Overall, a strong understanding of the use of parables for correction and revelation in biblical narratives is demonstrated."
