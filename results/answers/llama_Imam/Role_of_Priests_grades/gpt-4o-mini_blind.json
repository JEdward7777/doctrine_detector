  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response attempts to explain the responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, referencing similarities in other religions. The student correctly highlights the sacrificial, intercessory, ritual, teaching, and governance duties of priests in the Old Testament. However, the response could have been improved by emphasizing the distinctiveness of the priestly role in Judaism and focusing more on the biblical explanation without bringing in references from other religions. Additionally, the response lacked depth in explaining the significance and spiritual symbolism behind the priestly duties. More scriptural references and theological insights could have enhanced the answer."
