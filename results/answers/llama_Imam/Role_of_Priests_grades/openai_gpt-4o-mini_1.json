It correctly addresses the concern of understanding the biblical role of priests from an Old Testament perspective. However, it could have further emphasized the distinct Christian view of priesthood, highlighting the significance of the High Priest and the foreshadowing of Christ's role as the ultimate High Priest in Christianity. Additionally, a more explicit comparison and contrast between the roles of priests in Judaism and Christianity would have enhanced the analysis from a Christian perspective."
