  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of the role of prophets in Islam and their responsibilities according to Islamic scriptures, the concern was specifically about understanding the biblical role of prophets according to the Bible. The student did not directly address this by providing information from the Bible itself. The student also made a statement about differences in interpretation between Islam and Christianity but did not delve into the specific biblical teachings on the primary role of a prophet as requested. Overall, the response provided valuable insights but lacked a direct connection to the concern given."
