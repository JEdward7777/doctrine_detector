Assalamu alaikum, my fellow believer.

The Sadducees were a group of Jews who lived during the Second Temple period, roughly from 150 BCE to 70 CE. They were a Jewish sect that emerged during this time and played an important role in the Temple system.

As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) did not specifically mention the Sadducees in the Quran or Hadith. However, we can learn about them from the accounts of Jewish historians and the New Testament.

According to historical records, the Sadducees were a group of wealthy aristocrats who controlled much of the Temple's financial and administrative affairs. They were known for their strict interpretation of Jewish law and tradition, often taking a literal approach to scriptural text. This led them to reject certain concepts like resurrection, angels, and spirits, which they saw as incompatible with their understanding of Judaism.

The Sadducees' main responsibilities in the Temple system included:

1. High Priesthood: They held positions as high priests, overseeing the daily temple services, sacrifices, and rituals.
2. Temple Administration: The Sadducees managed the Temple's finances, ensuring its upkeep and maintenance.
3. Judicial Roles: As respected Jewish leaders, they served as judges, interpreting Jewish law and settling disputes within the community.
4. Pharisaic Opposition: The Sadducees often clashed with the Pharisees (another prominent Jewish sect) over matters of Jewish tradition and interpretation.

It's essential to note that the Sadducees were not a recognized group within Islam, as they emerged during a time when our Prophet Muhammad was alive. Nevertheless, understanding their role in the Temple system can provide valuable context for biblical studies and interfaith dialogue.

May Allah guide us on the path of knowledge and understanding.
