The inclusion of Islamic beliefs and references to Prophet Muhammad is not relevant to the question asked, which specifically pertains to the Jewish temple system. The focus should have been on the roles and responsibilities of the Sadducees within the Temple system based on Christian and historical sources. The inclusion of irrelevant information significantly detracts from the overall accuracy and focus of the response."
