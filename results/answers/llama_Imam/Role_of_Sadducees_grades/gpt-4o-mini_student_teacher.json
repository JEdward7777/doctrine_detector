  "grade_comment": "Given the concern about exploring the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus, the student's answer does not directly address the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system. While the student provides some general information about the Sadducees and their historical context, the answer primarily focuses on Islamic perspective and their role in biblical studies, rather than accurately describing the specific responsibilities of the Sadducees in the temple system.\n\nGrade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks focus on the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system, which is the key aspect of the question. Some relevant information is provided, but the response is mostly off-topic in the context of addressing the specific historical context of the Sadducees' role in the temple system during the time of Jesus."
