  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and respectful explanation of the scribes' role in preserving the scriptures, drawing from Islamic tradition. However, the answer veered off from the specific concern of understanding the significance of the scribes' role in biblical history, focusing more on the Islamic perspective. While the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and highlighted relevant responsibilities of the scribes, the answer lacked direct alignment with the given concern."
