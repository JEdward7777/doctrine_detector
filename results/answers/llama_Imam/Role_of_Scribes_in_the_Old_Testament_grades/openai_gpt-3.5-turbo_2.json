It demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the scribes' role in biblical history and the preservation of scripture within an Islamic perspective. The response could have further emphasized the divine guidance believed to have been bestowed upon the scribes by Allah (SWT) to maintain the integrity of the scriptures, aligning more explicitly with a Christian worldview but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
