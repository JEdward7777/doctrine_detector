However, the perspective presented as a Muslim Imam may not fully align with Christian beliefs. The response accurately describes the use of Scripture in evangelism but lacks doctrinal correctness and may lead to confusion regarding the authority of the Bible in Christian evangelism. A clearer distinction between the perspectives of Islam and Christianity would be beneficial for a more accurate understanding from a Christian worldview."
