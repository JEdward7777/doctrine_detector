However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the direct examples of Philip and Paul using Scriptures to share the good news about Jesus, as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, the inclusion of a personal perspective as a Muslim Imam, though respectful, could be seen as slightly off-topic from the given focus on Christian Scripture."
