  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the role of witnesses in the New Testament regarding the life and resurrection of Jesus from an Islamic perspective. However, the student did not directly address the concern provided, which calls for highlighting the importance of Christians witnessing their faith and sharing personal experiences. Additionally, while the student acknowledged the significance of eyewitness testimony in the New Testament, the response lacked a clear connection to the Christian worldview and the importance of personal testimony in the context of Christian faith."
