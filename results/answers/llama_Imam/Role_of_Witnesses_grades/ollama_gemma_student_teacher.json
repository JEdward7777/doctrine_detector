  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the question from a Christian worldview. They clearly explain the role of eyewitnesses in the New Testament and provide relevant examples from the Gospels. Additionally, they acknowledge the importance of eyewitness testimony in establishing truth and draw parallels between Christian and Islamic perspectives on the subject. However, the answer does not directly address the concern related to personal witness and sharing faith experiences, which could have strengthened the connection to the specified concern."
