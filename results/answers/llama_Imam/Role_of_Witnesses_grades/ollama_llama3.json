It also makes an effort to engage with the concern by noting the importance of personal experiences and witness in Christianity. However, it could be improved by more explicitly connecting the importance of witnesses in the New Testament to the call for Christians to share their own testimonies of God's work in their lives. Additionally, while the response provides a nuanced Islamic perspective, it may benefit from a stronger emphasis on the shared value of eyewitness testimony across both Christian and Muslim traditions."
