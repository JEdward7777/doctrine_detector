## [Answer](../Role_of_Witnesses.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that the New Testament is a holy book for Christians, not Muslims. However, as an Imam, I can provide you with an Islamic perspective on the matter.

In the New Testament, eyewitnesses played a crucial role in attesting to the life and resurrection of Jesus. The apostles and other disciples who had personally witnessed Jesus' teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection were called to testify about these events. For example:

1. The Resurrection: The New Testament accounts report that multiple individuals saw Jesus after his crucifixion and burial, including Mary Magdalene (John 20:11-18), the apostle Peter (Luke 24:34), and other disciples who had gone fishing (John 21:1-14).
2. The Crucifixion: The Gospels describe how Jesus was publicly executed by Roman authorities, with eyewitnesses like Pontius Pilate, the soldiers, and the Jewish leaders present.
3. Miracles: Many miracles are attributed to Jesus in the New Testament, such as feeding the 5,000 (Matthew 14:13-21), healing the sick (Matthew 8:16-17), and raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-44). These events were witnessed by various individuals, including crowds of people.

In Islam, we believe in the importance of eyewitness testimony as a means to establish truth. The Quran emphasizes the role of witnesses in settling disputes and establishing justice (Quran 49:13, 24:2-4).

However, it's essential to note that Muslims do not accept the New Testament accounts as authoritative evidence for Jesus' life or resurrection. As Muslims, we rely on our own holy book, the Quran, which provides us with a unique and authoritative account of God's revelation.

In conclusion, while eyewitnesses played a significant role in the New Testament regarding the life and resurrection of Jesus, Muslims must evaluate these accounts within the context of their own faith tradition and Scripture.
