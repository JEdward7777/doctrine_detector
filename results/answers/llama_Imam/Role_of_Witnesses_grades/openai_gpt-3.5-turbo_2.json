  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of witnesses in the New Testament sharing their firsthand accounts of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection as a call for Christians to witness their faith and share personal experiences of God's work. The integration of a Christian worldview perspective is clear and relevant. However, since the response is presented from an Islamic standpoint rather than a Christian one, the grade is slightly lowered due to the non-alignment with the specified concern of viewing it within a Christian-specific worldview."
