  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective on the significance of eyewitness testimony in the New Testament. It appropriately acknowledges the role of witnesses in affirming the events surrounding Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. While the focus is on an Islamic viewpoint, it effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of Christians witnessing their faith and sharing personal experiences of God's work. The grade is slightly lower as there could have been a clearer integration of the Christian specific worldview into the response."
