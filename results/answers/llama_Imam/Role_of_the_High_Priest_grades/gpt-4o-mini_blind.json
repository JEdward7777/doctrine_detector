The answer should have focused on the responsibilities of the High Priest as outlined in the Old Testament and how they related to the sacrificial system and the foreshadowing of Christ's role as the ultimate High Priest. The theological differences between Islamic traditions and Christian beliefs should be acknowledged and the answer should have centered on Christian doctrinal teachings."
