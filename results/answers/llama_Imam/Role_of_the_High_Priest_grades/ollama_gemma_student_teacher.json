The response is well-written, providing concise explanations of the various duties and their significance. \n\nHowever, the answer lacks specific references to the provided reference answer concerning the special sacrifice in the most holy part of the tabernacle/temple. This omission slightly diminishes the comprehensiveness of the response from the Christian worldview perspective."
