The provided answer is also not adequately addressed, as the response does not discuss the specific sacrifice offered by the High Priest once a year.\n\nWhile the response mentions some responsibilities of the High Priest, such as spiritual leadership and ritual duties, it does not delve deeper into the importance of these roles or how they contributed to Israel's worship practices. Additionally, the response jumps abruptly from discussing the High Priest's role to emphasizing Islamic tradition and the recognition of prophets and messengers.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest providing a more direct answer to the original question, specifically addressing the significance of the High Priest's role in ancient Israel's worship practices."
