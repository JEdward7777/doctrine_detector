The connection between the High Priest's role in Israel and Islamic beliefs is well-explained, showcasing a respectful approach to different religious traditions. However, the response could have delved deeper into the significance and symbolism of the High Priest's annual sacrifice in the most holy part of the tabernacle or temple to fully address the concern."
