The answer effectively highlights the unique responsibilities and spiritual importance attributed to the High Priest within the worship practices of Israel. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic beliefs and perspectives adds depth to the comparison and understanding of religious traditions. However, a stronger emphasis on the exclusive role of the High Priest as the mediator for atonement and intercession for the people's sins could enhance the response further."
