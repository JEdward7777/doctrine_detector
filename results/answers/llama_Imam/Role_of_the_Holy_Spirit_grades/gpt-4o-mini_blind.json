However, the answer lacks doctrinal accuracy as the Holy Spirit is not interchangeable with the concepts of \"ruhaniyya\" and \"hubbullah\" in Islam. It is important to note the distinct differences in the theological understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in empowering believers within Christianity. The response could have elaborated more on the specific empowering characteristics attributed to the Holy Spirit in Christian theology."
