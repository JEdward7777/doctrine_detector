  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the Christian concept of being empowered by the Holy Spirit. They effectively draw parallels between Islamic concepts of \"ruhaniyya\" and \"hubbullah\" and the Christian idea of the Holy Spirit. The response provides clear and concise explanations of how these concepts relate to spiritual guidance, love, and personal growth. While the student does not explicitly mention the experience of being \"born again,\" their exploration of the empowering influence of the divine aligns with the reference answer."
