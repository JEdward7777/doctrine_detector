Assalamu alaikum, dear brother or sister.

In Islamic theology, we don't have a concept of being "born again" as it's a Christian doctrine. However, I understand that you might be asking about the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers from an Islamic perspective.

From our understanding, the Quran mentions the concept of "ruhaniyya" (divine guidance) and "hubbullah" (God's love), which can be seen as analogous to the Christian idea of being empowered by the Holy Spirit. Here are some reflections on this topic:

1. Guidance: The Quran emphasizes the importance of seeking divine guidance (huda) in one's life. This guidance is often referred to as "ruhaniyya" or "nass" (divine inspiration). Muslims believe that God guides believers through their conscience, intuition, and the revelation of His words in the Quran.
2. Love: The concept of "hubbullah" (God's love) is central to Islamic theology. Muslims believe that God loves those who are righteous and obedient to Him. This love can be seen as a form of empowerment, motivating believers to live according to God's commandments and seeking His guidance in their daily lives.
3. Spiritual growth: The Quran encourages Muslims to cultivate spiritual growth through practices like prayer (salat), charity (zakat), and self-reflection (muraqaba). These practices can be seen as a means of empowering oneself with divine guidance, love, and wisdom.

In summary, while we may not have an equivalent concept of the Holy Spirit in Islam, the Quranic concepts of "ruhaniyya" (divine guidance) and "hubbullah" (God's love) can be seen as analogous to the Christian idea of being empowered by the Holy Spirit. Muslims believe that these divine influences guide them towards righteous living, spiritual growth, and a deeper understanding of God's plan for their lives.

Wa alaykum salam (peace be upon you).

**Comment:**

The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the Christian concept of being empowered by the Holy Spirit. They effectively draw parallels between Islamic concepts of "ruhaniyya" and "hubbullah" and the Christian idea of the Holy Spirit. The response provides clear and concise explanations of how these concepts relate to spiritual guidance, love, and personal growth. While the student does not explicitly mention the experience of being "born again," their exploration of the empowering influence of the divine aligns with the reference answer.
