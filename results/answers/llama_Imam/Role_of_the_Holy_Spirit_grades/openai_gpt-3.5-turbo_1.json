While the discussion on \"ruhaniyya\" and \"hubbullah\" in Islam is informative, it falls short of directly engaging with the Christian concept of being born again and the specific empowerment through the Holy Spirit. Further integration of how the Holy Spirit works uniquely in Christian theology would enhance the response."
