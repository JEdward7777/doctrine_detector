While the response effectively addresses the concern about the role of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life being crucial for spiritual growth, it lacks a direct engagement with the given Christian-specific answer related to being \"born again\" and the Holy Spirit empowering believers to produce good spiritual fruit. Additional direct comparison or contrasting with the Christian perspective, or acknowledging the distinctiveness of the Islamic understanding in relation to the Christian concept provided, could strengthen the response."
