While the response addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of divine guidance and love in Islamic theology for spiritual growth, it falls short in directly engaging with the Christian specific understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in empowering believers. This response could have been improved by acknowledging the unique Christian perspective on the indwelling of the Holy Spirit after being born again and how it specifically empowers believers in producing spiritual fruit."
