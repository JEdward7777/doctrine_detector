  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on creation and respectfully articulates the Islamic belief in Allah as the sole Creator. While the response does not align with the Christian perspective on the Holy Spirit's involvement in creation, it offers a respectful and insightful alternative perspective. The student's clear explanation of the Quranic verses and their interpretation of Genesis 1:1-2 showcases their knowledge of both Islamic and biblical narratives."
