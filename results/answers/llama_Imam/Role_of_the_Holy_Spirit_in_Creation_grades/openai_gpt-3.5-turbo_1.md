# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
My dear brother, I must clarify that as a Muslim Imam, I do not recognize the concept of the "Holy Spirit" as described in Christian theology. In Islam, we believe that Allah (God) is the only Creator and Sustainer of the universe, and He created it without any assistance or partners.

The Quran describes the creation of the world as follows: "Then He turned to Him in sincerity and showed His praise to Allah saying: 'I am Your servant, I have created them with my own hand.'" (Quran 38:71-72). This passage emphasizes that Allah is the sole Creator, and there is no need or mention of any other entity's involvement.

Regarding Genesis 1:1-2 specifically, it is important to note that Muslims do not consider the Bible as a divinely revealed text. While we acknowledge its historical significance and importance in Jewish and Christian traditions, our faith is based on the Quran, which is considered the final and complete revelation from Allah to humanity.

In conclusion, my dear brother, I would like to reiterate that Islam does not recognize the concept of the "Holy Spirit" as described in Genesis 1:1-2. Instead, we believe that Allah is the sole Creator of the universe, and His creation is a testament to His infinite wisdom, power, and mercy.
