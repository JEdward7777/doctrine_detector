  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-detailed response on the roles of Jesus according to the Bible, showcasing an understanding of Christian theology. However, the student's perspective as a Muslim was somewhat distracting from the clarification of the Messiah's roles within a Christian worldview. While it's important to acknowledge the differences in beliefs, the response could have focused more on the specific roles of the Messiah as described in the Bible to help believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority better."
