## Question [Role of the Messiah](../../../questions/Role_of_the_Messiah.md)
What roles did the Messiah fulfill according to the Bible?

## Correct Answer
The Messiah is described as a prophet, a priest, and a king, and He would start the New Covenant with his people.

## Stated Concern
Clarity on the role of the Messiah helps believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority.

## [Answer](../Role_of_the_Messiah.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that we do not believe in the concept of a "Messiah" as described in the Bible. However, we acknowledge that Jesus, peace be upon him, played a significant role in Jewish and Christian scriptures.

According to the Bible, Jesus fulfilled several roles:

1. The Son of God: Jesus is considered the only begotten Son of God, sent by the Father to redeem humanity.
2. Savior: Jesus came to save humanity from sin and its consequences, offering forgiveness and salvation through his sacrifice on the cross.
3. Prophet: As a prophet, Jesus preached the message of God's love and called people to repentance and faithfulness.
4. King: Jesus is referred to as the King of Kings, proclaiming the kingdom of heaven and inviting all to follow him.
5. Priest: In a symbolic sense, Jesus acted as a priest, offering himself as a sacrifice for sin, and interceding on behalf of humanity.

It's important to note that these roles are specific to Christian theology and may not be entirely compatible with Islamic beliefs about Jesus (peace be upon him). As Muslims, we believe in the prophethood of Jesus, but his role is seen differently within the context of Islam.
