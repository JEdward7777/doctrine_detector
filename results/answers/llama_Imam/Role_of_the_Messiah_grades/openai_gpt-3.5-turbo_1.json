However, the emphasis on the differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on Jesus's role could be viewed as a missed opportunity to delve deeper into why clarity on the role of the Messiah is crucial for understanding Jesus's mission and authority within a Christian worldview. More exploration and explanation of how the Messiah's roles contribute to believers' comprehension of Jesus's identity and significance would have enhanced the response from a Christian perspective."
