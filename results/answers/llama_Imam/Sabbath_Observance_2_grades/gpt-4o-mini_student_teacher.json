However, the answer strays from the Christian specific worldview by referencing the Quran alongside the Torah. While the student demonstrates an understanding of the importance of observing the Sabbath, the focus should have been solely on God's instructions to the Israelites as outlined in the Torah. The reference answer provided a more concise and accurate explanation based on the Christian perspective."
