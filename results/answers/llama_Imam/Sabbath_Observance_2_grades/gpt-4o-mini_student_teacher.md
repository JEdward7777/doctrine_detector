Dear brother, this is a great question!

According to the Quran and the Torah, when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, they would collect manna, the supernatural bread sent by Allah (God), on six days of the week. However, on the seventh day, which was the Sabbath, they would not gather manna.

The Quran describes this situation in Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 57-58:

"And when it descended on them in their ignorance, We guided them to its way. None hath the right to guide except Allah, a People who have submitted [to Him]. And when fear befell them, they said: 'Our Lord has made this provision and manna for us; as though we had asked: "Provide for our sustenance. Forgive us our sins. Have mercy on us! You are the Bestower.'"

The Torah also recounts this story in Exodus 16:23-26:

"And when the Sabbath came, they gathered twice as much - two omers of manna - for each one. They measured it by the omer measure. And all their leaders took some and brought it before Eleazar the priest, who was over the holy things... All that the Israelites had gathered they measured out from this standard - an omer for each person."

The instruction from Allah/God was to not gather manna on the Sabbath day, which is a sign of His trust in the Israelites' obedience and their recognition of His sacred day. This act of faith demonstrated that they acknowledged the Sabbath as a special time set apart for worship, rest, and remembrance of God's creation.

In this context, Allah/God was teaching the Israelites about the importance of observing the Sabbath and respecting its sanctity. It is also an example for us Muslims to reflect on the value of setting aside time for spiritual growth, community building, and remembering our Creator.

May Allah guide us all in understanding His wisdom and instructions!

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response is well-written and provides a detailed explanation from both the Quran and the Torah regarding the gathering of manna in relation to the Sabbath. However, the answer strays from the Christian specific worldview by referencing the Quran alongside the Torah. While the student demonstrates an understanding of the importance of observing the Sabbath, the focus should have been solely on God's instructions to the Israelites as outlined in the Torah. The reference answer provided a more concise and accurate explanation based on the Christian perspective.
