Instead, it presents a more general explanation of the Israelites' gathering of manna and their recognition of the Sabbath as a special time set apart for worship and rest.\n\nThe response is strong in its biblical references (Quran and Torah) and its theological reflection on the significance of observing the Sabbath. However, it does not specifically address the question being asked, which is why I gave it a 60 out of 100."
