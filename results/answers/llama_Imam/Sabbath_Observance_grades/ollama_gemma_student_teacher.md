## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Sister in Islam, I'm happy to help you with that question.

In the Quran, we do not find a direct reference to the concept of "keeping the Sabbath holy" as it is mentioned in the Torah (Old Testament) and interpreted by some Christian denominations. This commandment was given to the Children of Israel through Moses, specifically in Exodus 20:8-11 and Deuteronomy 5:12-15.

According to Islamic understanding, the Quranic revelation superseded previous scriptures, including the Torah. Therefore, we must understand the context and original intent behind this commandment before applying it to our modern lives.

In Islam, we believe that Allah (SWT) has created a natural rhythm for humanity, which includes six days of work and rest, with one day dedicated to worship and spiritual rejuvenation â€“ Friday, or Jumu'ah in Arabic. While there isn't an explicit equivalent to the Sabbath commandment in Islam, our faith encourages us to set aside time for prayer, reflection, and devotion to Allah (SWT) on Fridays.

In the context of the Quranic revelation, "keeping the Sabbath holy" likely meant observing a day of rest from worldly activities, dedicating it to spiritual growth, and demonstrating obedience to Allah's (SWT) commands. This might have included:

1. Avoiding work or engaging in strenuous activities.
2. Gathering for communal worship and prayer.
3. Engaging in acts of kindness, charity, and compassion.
4. Showing respect and reverence for the day as a sacred time.

In Islam, we understand that Allah (SWT) has made every moment holy, and we are encouraged to live each day with devotion and remembrance of Him. While there may not be an exact equivalent to the Sabbath commandment in Islam, our faith emphasizes the importance of setting aside time for spiritual growth, self-reflection, and worship on Fridays and other days.

May Allah (SWT) guide us all in keeping His commands and living a life of devotion and righteousness!
