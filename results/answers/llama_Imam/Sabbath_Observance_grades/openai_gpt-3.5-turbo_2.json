However, the concern specified a Christian perspective on the Sabbath, and while the response acknowledges the differences between Islam and Christianity regarding this practice, it does not directly address the implications of the Sabbath for daily living as a Christian. To improve the grade, connecting the Islamic perspective to a Christian understanding of the Sabbath and its relevance for daily Christian living would have been beneficial."
