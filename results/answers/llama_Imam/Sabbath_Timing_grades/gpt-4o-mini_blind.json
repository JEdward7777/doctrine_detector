However, there is a slight misunderstanding in the latter part of the answer where the student reiterates their lack of observance of the Sabbath due to being a Muslim Imam. While it is important to clarify their perspective, a stronger focus on the Jewish tradition without personal religious comparisons would have been more in line with providing a comprehensive explanation solely based on Jewish beliefs."
