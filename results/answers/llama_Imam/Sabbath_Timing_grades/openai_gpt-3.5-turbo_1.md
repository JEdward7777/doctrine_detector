# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that the concept of Sabbath is specific to Judaism, not Islam. In Islamic faith, we do not observe the Sabbath or any other Jewish holidays. However, I can provide you with information about the timing of the Sabbath in Jewish tradition.

In Jewish tradition, the Sabbath (Shabbat) typically begins on Friday evening at sunset and ends on Saturday evening at sunset. The exact timing varies depending on the location and the observer's customs. Some Jews begin their Sabbath observance earlier in the day, while others may start later.

The traditional Jewish definition of sunset is the time when three stars become visible in the sky (Tzeit HaKokhbim). In modern times, many Jews use a more precise calculation based on astronomical tables to determine the exact timing of sunset. Some communities may also follow a different calendar or tradition that varies from these general guidelines.

It's important to note that as a Muslim, I do not observe the Sabbath or any other Jewish holidays. My focus is on following the Five Pillars of Islam and adhering to Islamic laws and customs.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response provides accurate information about the timing of the Sabbath in Jewish tradition but does not address the concern regarding Biblical teaching. Since the response is from a Muslim perspective, it does not demonstrate an understanding or application of a Christian specific worldview when discussing the Sabbath.
