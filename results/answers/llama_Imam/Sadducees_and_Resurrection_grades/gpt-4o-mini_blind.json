However, since the question specifically asked for a Christian perspective, the answer should have focused more on Christian beliefs and doctrine, rather than primarily on Islamic beliefs. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, Jesus is viewed as more than just a prophet, so referring to him simply as \"Jesus (peace be upon him)\" may not align with Christian theology. The response could have delved deeper into the Christian understanding of resurrection, emphasizing Jesus' own resurrection and the significance of bodily resurrection in Christian eschatology."
