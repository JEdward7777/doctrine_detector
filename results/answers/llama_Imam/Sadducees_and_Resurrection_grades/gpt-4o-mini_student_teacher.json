  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response from an Islamic perspective, discussing the belief in resurrection in Islam and contrasting it with the denial of resurrection by the Sadducees. However, the answer primarily focuses on Islamic beliefs and teachings rather than directly addressing the Christian perspective as the question requested. The student did not sufficiently emphasize the contrast between the Sadducees' belief and Christian teaching as the reference answer did. The answer is informative but lacks a strong comparison between the beliefs, which limits its effectiveness in addressing the concern of understanding differences in beliefs and their implications for faith from a Christian worldview."
