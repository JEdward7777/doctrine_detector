  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some factual inaccuracies and misinterpretations due to the inclusion of references to the Quran and Islamic beliefs, which are not relevant to the Christian-specific worldview that should be applied when discussing Samson's story and the Nazirite vow. The response also lacks a clear focus on the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment, which was the specified concern. The student did touch on some implications of the Nazirite vow in Samson's story, but the answer does not align well with the Christian perspective presented in the teacher's reference answer."
