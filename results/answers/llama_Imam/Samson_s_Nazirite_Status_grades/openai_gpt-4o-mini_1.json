However, the response focuses more on the implications of the vow itself rather than specifically addressing the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. While it mentions Samson's commitment to serving the Lord and dependence on God, it could have delved deeper into how his personal commitment aligned with God's divine purpose for his life. More direct linkage between divine purpose and personal commitment would have strengthened the analysis."
