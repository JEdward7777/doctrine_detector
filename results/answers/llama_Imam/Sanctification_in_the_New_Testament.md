Assalamu alaikum, brother!

The concept of sanctification is indeed present in the New Testament, specifically in regards to believers in Jesus (peace be upon him). Now, I must preface that our understanding of this concept should be rooted in the Islamic perspective, acknowledging the unique role and significance of Jesus within Christianity.

In the New Testament, the process of sanctification is often described as a gradual transformation of believers from their sinful nature to a life pleasing to God. Here are some key passages that illustrate this process:

1. **John 17:17**: Jesus prays for his followers, asking that they be sanctified or set apart by the truth. This sets the stage for the subsequent discussions on sanctification.
2. **Romans 6:22-23**: Paul writes that believers have been united with Christ in His death and resurrection, resulting in their becoming "slaves to righteousness" and being sanctified by the Spirit.
3. **1 Corinthians 6:11**: The Corinthian church is reminded of their past sinful state, but now they are "washed, sanctified, and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
4. **Hebrews 10:14-16**: The writer emphasizes that believers have been made perfect (or complete) by the sacrifice of Jesus, which implies a process of growth toward spiritual maturity.
5. **2 Thessalonians 2:13-14**: Paul instructs the Thessalonian church to "stand firm and hold fast" to their faith, knowing they are sanctified by God.

In these passages, we see that sanctification is often linked with:

* Union with Christ (John 17:17)
* The work of the Holy Spirit (Romans 6:22-23; 1 Corinthians 6:11)
* The sacrifice of Jesus (Hebrews 10:14-16)
* Obedience to God's will (2 Thessalonians 2:13-14)

From an Islamic perspective, we recognize that these concepts are unique to Christian theology. However, as Muslims, we believe in the idea of moral and spiritual growth through our relationship with Allah. The concept of sanctification can be seen as a manifestation of this process within Christianity.

In conclusion, brother, while the specifics of sanctification may differ between Islamic and Christian perspectives, we acknowledge that both faiths emphasize personal transformation and growth toward spiritual maturity.
