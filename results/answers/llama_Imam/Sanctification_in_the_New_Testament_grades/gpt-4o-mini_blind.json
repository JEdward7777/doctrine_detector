While the student identifies key passages and aspects related to sanctification, there is a lack of doctrinal correctness in the explanation. The Islamic perspective should not have been the primary focus, and the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of sanctification within Christianity. Additionally, the use of \"peace be upon him\" in reference to Jesus is not in line with Christian beliefs. More emphasis on Jesus as the central figure of sanctification and the role of grace and faith in the process would have enhanced the response."
