  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful analysis of the concept of sanctification as described in the New Testament. However, the student's response did not specifically address the concern of recognizing the role of faith in the process of sanctification as outlined in the reference answer. The student also introduced perspectives from Islam, which while informative, deviated from the focus on the Christian worldview. As such, the grade is lower as the answer did not directly align with the specified concern."
