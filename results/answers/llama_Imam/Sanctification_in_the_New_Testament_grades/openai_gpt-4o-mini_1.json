However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern about the role of faith in sanctification. The response could have delved deeper into the importance of faith as the foundation and catalyst for sanctification in Christian belief. Additionally, while the response attempts to bridge Islamic and Christian perspectives on personal growth and transformation, it could have provided more insight on the distinct Christian understanding of sanctification through faith in Jesus Christ."
