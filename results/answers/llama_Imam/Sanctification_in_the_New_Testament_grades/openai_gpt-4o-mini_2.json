  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of sanctification in the New Testament, incorporating relevant passages and discussing key aspects such as union with Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, and obedience to God's will. The student also successfully addresses the concern by recognizing the role of faith in the process of sanctification. However, there is a slight deviation from focusing solely on the role of faith, as the response also touches on other aspects such as the sacrifice of Jesus and the work of the Holy Spirit. Overall, an excellent response demonstrating a strong understanding of sanctification in Christianity from an Islamic perspective."
