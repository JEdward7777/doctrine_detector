## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaykum, dear brother or sister.

In the context of the Bible, the concept of "sanctuary" (Hebrew: מִקְדָשׁ, mikdash) refers to a sacred or holy place where God dwells among His people. In the Old Testament, the word "sanctuary" is often used to describe the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem, which served as the central place of worship for the Israelites.

The sanctuary was considered a threshold between the physical world and the spiritual realm, a space where humans could connect with God's presence. It was designed to be a replica of the heavenly tabernacle, symbolizing God's throne room on earth. The high priest would enter the sanctuary once a year on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement) to offer sacrifices and prayers for the forgiveness of sins.

In this context, the sanctuary represents a sacred space where humanity can encounter God's holiness, seek His guidance, and find solace in His presence. This concept is closely tied to the idea of qibla in Islam, which refers to the direction of prayer towards the Kaaba in Mecca, symbolizing the connection between Muslims and their Lord.

While the specific details of the sanctuary may differ from our Islamic understanding of sacred spaces, I believe that the underlying theme of seeking a deeper connection with the Divine is shared across both traditions. May Allah guide us all to seek His presence and guidance in our lives.
