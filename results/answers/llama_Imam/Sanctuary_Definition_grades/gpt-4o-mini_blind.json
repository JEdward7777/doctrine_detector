However, there are multiple instances where Islamic concepts and practices are equated or compared to Christian beliefs, which may lead to confusion or misinterpretation. The answer should focus more on the distinct Christian understanding of sanctuary without drawing parallels to Islamic concepts. Additionally, emphasizing the biblical teachings on sanctuary and its role in God's covenant with His people would have strengthened the response."
