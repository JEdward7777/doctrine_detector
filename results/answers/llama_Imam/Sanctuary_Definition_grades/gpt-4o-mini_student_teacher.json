  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of sanctuary in the Biblical context, highlighting how it represents a sacred space where God dwells among His people and where humans can connect with His presence. However, the response includes unnecessary comparisons to Islamic concepts like qibla that do not directly relate to the significance of sanctuary in the Bible. Additionally, while the student's explanation is detailed, there is a lack of direct reference to the idea of protection and safety associated with the term 'sanctuary' in the Bible, which is a key aspect of its meaning."
