The explanation of the sanctuary as a sacred space where humans could connect with God's presence and seek forgiveness of sins is accurate. The response also successfully draws parallels between the Christian and Islamic concepts of sacred spaces, showing an understanding of the common theme of seeking a deeper connection with the Divine. However, the focus on parallels with Islamic beliefs could be minimized in order to deepen the analysis of the Biblical understanding of sanctuary."
