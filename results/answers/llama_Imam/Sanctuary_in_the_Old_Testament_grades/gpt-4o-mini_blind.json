The student effectively references key passages from Exodus and Leviticus to support their points. The explanation of the sanctuary as a place where God dwells among His people, the significance of the mercy seat, and the role of priests in performing rituals is accurate. However, to enhance the response, the student could have delved deeper into the symbolism of the sanctuary elements and their connection to Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of these Old Testament practices. overall, a well-written and informative answer."
