  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained response about God's description of the sanctuary in the Old Testament. They accurately discussed the significance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God among His people and highlighted key Biblical passages. However, the student missed explicitly mentioning the sanctuary as a source of safety or protection for God's people, as stated in the reference answer. Emphasizing this aspect would have strengthened their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
