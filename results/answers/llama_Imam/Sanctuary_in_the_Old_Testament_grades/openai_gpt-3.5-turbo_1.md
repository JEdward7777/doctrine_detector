# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
In the Old Testament, God describes the sanctuary as a sacred space where He dwells among His people. In Exodus 25:8-9, God commands Moses to build a sanctuary, saying:

"According to all that I show you on the pattern of the tabernacle and according to all its instructions, so you shall do it. And you shall make it of ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue and purple and scarlet; and they shall be coupled together with cherubim."

In this passage, God emphasizes the importance of building a sanctuary where He can dwell among His people. The word "tabernacle" (mishkan in Hebrew) connotes a temporary dwelling place or tent, which is fitting since the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness at the time.

Later in Exodus 25:22, God says:

"And above it you shall make the mercy seat of pure gold; and you shall make to it a rim all around by an edge of half a cubit."

The "mercy seat" (kapporet in Hebrew) was the place where God's throne was believed to reside. It was covered with a layer of pure gold, symbolizing God's holiness and majesty.

In Leviticus 16:2, we read:

"When you take the garments from your brother Israelites and put them on, and when you have consecrated them, then they shall be used by you to minister before the Lord."

The sanctuary was a place where priests would perform rituals and sacrifices on behalf of the people. These offerings were meant to purify and sanctify both the people and the sanctuary itself.

In summary, God describes the sanctuary as a sacred space where He dwells among His people. It's a temporary dwelling place that symbolizes God's presence and majesty, and it serves as a place for priests to perform rituals and sacrifices on behalf of the people.
