The student effectively conveys the teachings of Islam on this topic. However, the framing of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as merely a messenger rather than the final Prophet could mislead readers regarding Islamic beliefs. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the eternal nature of the punishment for Satan and his followers, as well as the absolute justice of God's judgment, would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
