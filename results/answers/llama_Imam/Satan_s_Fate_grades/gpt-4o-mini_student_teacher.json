  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the fate of Satan and his followers in Islamic theology, referencing relevant Quranic verses, hadiths, and classical Islamic texts. However, the answer does not align with the Christian worldview and the concern raised regarding the implications of Satan's fate on the struggle between good and evil in Christian theology. From a Christian perspective, the belief is that Satan and his followers will face eternal punishment in hell as stated in the reference answer. The student's response, while informative and well-written, does not address the specific concern through a Christian lens."
