## [Answer](../Satan_s_Fate.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Dear brother/sister, the Quranic verses 72:1-2 describe the ultimate destiny of Iblis (Satan) and those who follow him:

"Say: 'No reward doth their falsehood receive. But the tricks they play shall be theirs to know soon. Their destinies are already fixed; but most of them understand not.'" (Quran 72:1-2)

According to these verses, Iblis and his followers will face severe punishment in Hell for their disobedience and misguidance. The Quran also emphasizes that those who reject the message of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and persistently follow Iblis's guidance will ultimately find themselves in the depths of Hell, suffering eternal torment.

The Quranic narrative describes Satan as a rebellious angel who refused to prostrate before Adam, thus disobeying Allah's command. As a result, he was cast out of Paradise (Jannah) along with his followers. The hadiths and classical Islamic texts elaborate on the nature of their punishment, stating that they will be subjected to intense physical and emotional suffering in Hell.

One famous hadith attributed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) describes the fate of Iblis and his followers:

"The Lord said: 'I am going to put you [Satan] and your followers in a valley where there is only fire, no water, and the punishment will never end.'" (Muslim, Sahih Muslim, Book 17, Hadith 4267)

Similarly, the Quranic verses (38:79-83) describe the suffering of Iblis's followers in Hell:

"When they are cast into the Fire, they shall hear its angry roar. When they see it, they will be surrounded by fire and boiling water and other torments that will afflict them on account of their own deeds. The most unfortunate among them is the one who will say: 'If only I could get a chance to turn back, I would not have committed such grave errors.'"

In Islamic eschatology, the ultimate fate of Satan and his followers in Hell serves as a warning to Muslims about the consequences of rejecting Allah's guidance and following the path of disobedience.
