## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum, dear brother/sister. As an Imam, I must clarify that Islam and Christianity have different theological frameworks regarding the concept of intercession. In Islam, we believe that Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final intercessor between God and humanity, as stated in the Quran (Quran 2:255). However, since you're asking about Bible verses, I'll provide some insights.

In the Bible, Jesus Christ is often depicted as an intercessor. For instance:

1. Isaiah 53:12 says, "He poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors." This verse highlights Jesus' role as a sacrifice who bore the sins of others and interceded on their behalf.

2. Hebrews 7:25 states, "He is able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them." This passage emphasizes Jesus' ongoing intercession on behalf of those who come to God through him.

3. 1 John 2:1-2 says, "And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world." This verse presents Jesus as an advocate or intercessor who pleads on behalf of humanity before God.

4. Revelation 5:6-14 describes Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world and is worthy to receive the book with seven seals, which contains the fate of humanity. This passage reinforces Jesus' role as an intercessor who advocates for humanity before God.

While these verses provide insights into Jesus' role as an intercessor, it's essential to note that Islam views intercession differently. In Islamic theology, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is considered the final intercessor and mediator between God and humanity.
