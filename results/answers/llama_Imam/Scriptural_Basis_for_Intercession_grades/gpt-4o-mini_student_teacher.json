  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed and detailed response by referencing Bible verses that highlight Jesus Christ as an intercessor. However, the student did not directly address the concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. The response would have been stronger if the student had incorporated more verses from the reference answer provided by the teacher."
