  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of Bible verses supporting the concept of propitiation and demonstrated an understanding of the importance of sacrifices in Christian theology. However, the response could have been more focused by highlighting the key verses specifically mentioned in the reference answer for a deeper understanding. Additionally, the student's perspective as a Muslim Imam, while interesting, detracts from the Christian-specific focus required for this assignment."
