They clearly explain the idea of Jesus' sacrifice as a means of appeasement for God's wrath and restore humanity to a right relationship with Him. Additionally, the student acknowledges the difference between Christian and Islamic understanding of propitiation, which demonstrates respect for both perspectives."
