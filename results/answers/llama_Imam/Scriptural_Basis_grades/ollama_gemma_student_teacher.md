## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that the concept of propitiation is not uniquely Islamic, but rather is also present in Christian theology. Propitiation refers to the idea that God's wrath or justice can be appeased or satisfied through some means, often understood as sacrifice or atonement.

In Christian scripture, several Bible verses support the concept of propitiation:

1. Isaiah 53:5 - "But he was pierced for our transgressions, the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by whose wounds we have been healed."
2. Romans 3:25 - "God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood, to demonstrate his justice, because in his human body he died, yet made alive by the Spirit."
3. Hebrews 9:28 - "So Christ was offered once for all to bear the sins of many. And just as it is appointed that men die once and after that comes judgment..."
4. John 1:29 - "The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, 'Look! The Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world!'"
5. Leviticus 16:10-11, 20-22 - "On the tenth day of this seventh month hold a sacred assembly. You are not to do any work. Because on that day he must make atonement for you... Aaron will then go into the holy place and come out, and offer his sin offering for himself and for his people..."
6. 1 John 2:2 - "He is the propitiation (appeaser) for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world."

These verses convey the idea that Jesus' sacrifice or death was necessary to appease God's wrath and restore humanity to a right relationship with Him. This concept is central to Christian theology and is often understood as part of the process of salvation.

As a Muslim, I must emphasize that while we acknowledge the importance of sacrifices in Jewish tradition and the concept of atonement, our understanding of propitiation is distinct from Christianity. In Islam, we believe that God's mercy and forgiveness are available to all who turn to Him sincerely, without the need for human sacrifice or mediation.
