However, the response primarily focuses on providing context and interpretations of specific biblical passages, rather than directly addressing how believers should navigate life in a world characterized by ungodly values. While the passages mentioned shed light on God's love for humanity and the distinction between believers and unbelievers, a more direct application to the concern raised would have enhanced the response. Encouraging consultation with Christian scholars was a positive addition, yet more integration of practical advice or guidance for believers facing ungodly values in the world would have been beneficial."
