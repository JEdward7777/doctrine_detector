The explanation was clear and tied back to the concern raised. However, the response could have delved deeper into the interpretation and application of the specific passages mentioned to offer more insights and guidance for navigating life as a believer in a world with ungodly values. Adding further connections to the practical implications for believers would have strengthened the response."
