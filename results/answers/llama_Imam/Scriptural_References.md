Assalamu alaikum!

The reference you're looking for is actually found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 28:3, where it is written:

"And God Almighty (El Shaddai) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush..."

This passage describes an encounter between Abraham and Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) at the burning bush. This event marks a significant moment in Abraham's life, as he was instructed by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

May Allah guide us all on our own journeys and paths!
