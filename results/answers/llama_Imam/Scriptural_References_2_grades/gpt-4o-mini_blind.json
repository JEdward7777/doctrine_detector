However, there are some inaccuracies in the interpretation of the passages that deviate from a Christian worldview. The answer correctly identifies relevant passages, but the explanations and references to Islamic concepts detract from the doctrinal accuracy and could cause confusion for individuals seeking a Christian perspective on the Day of Judgment. Additional clarity and alignment with Christian teachings would strengthen the response."
