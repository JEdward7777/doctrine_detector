  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of relevant Biblical passages that support the concept of the Day of Judgment, drawing connections between the passages and themes of accountability, judgment, and rewards/punishments. However, the response focused mainly on New Testament passages, with limited inclusion of Old Testament references that could have provided a more holistic view on the concept of judgment in the Bible. Additionally, while the passages provided were insightful and relevant, they did not precisely align with the key passages identified by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of judgment in the Bible from a Christian perspective but could have further strengthened the answer by incorporating the specified key passages and a more balanced selection of Old and New Testament references."
