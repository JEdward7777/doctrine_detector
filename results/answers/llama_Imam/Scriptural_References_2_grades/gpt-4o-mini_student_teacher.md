## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that the Day of Judgment (Qiyamah) is a fundamental concept in Islamic theology, rooted in the Quran and Hadith. However, since you're asking for Biblical references, I'll provide some relevant passages:

1. Revelation 20:5-6 - "The sea gave up its dead, and Hades gave up its dead. Then they were judged, just as they had been in their lifetime. The second death, which is also the lake of fire, was cast into the fiery lake."
In this passage, Jesus speaks about the final judgment, where all people will be resurrected and judged according to their deeds.

2. Matthew 25:31-46 - "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit down on the throne of his glory. And before him shall be gathered all nations... Then they that feared him are become as stubble; and there is no herb left for them. But the righteous unto eternal life are spared."
This passage describes the judgment of nations based on how they treated the least of these, Jesus' teachings about compassion and kindness.

3. Revelation 22:12 - "Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give every man according to his work."
This verse highlights the idea that people will be judged based on their deeds, as recorded in the Book of Life (Quranic concept of Al-Kitab).

4. Matthew 24:35 - "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away."
This passage emphasizes the importance of listening to Jesus' teachings, which will serve as a basis for judgment on the Day of Judgment.

5. Luke 12:47-48 - "And that servant who knew his lord's will, yet did not make ready or do according to his will, shall receive many stripes... And he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few."
This passage illustrates the concept of accountability for one's actions and decisions.

6. Romans 14:10-12 - "But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ... For none of us lives to himself, nor dies to himself."
This passage highlights the importance of treating others with compassion and humility, as we will all be judged by Christ.

Please note that these passages are not necessarily direct references to the Day of Judgment, but they do emphasize the concepts of accountability, judgment, and reward/punishment based on one's actions.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of relevant Biblical passages that support the concept of the Day of Judgment, drawing connections between the passages and themes of accountability, judgment, and rewards/punishments. However, the response focused mainly on New Testament passages, with limited inclusion of Old Testament references that could have provided a more holistic view on the concept of judgment in the Bible. Additionally, while the passages provided were insightful and relevant, they did not precisely align with the key passages identified by the teacher. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of judgment in the Bible from a Christian perspective but could have further strengthened the answer by incorporating the specified key passages and a more balanced selection of Old and New Testament references.
