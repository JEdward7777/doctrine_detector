  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides well-researched and relevant biblical passages to support the concept of the Day of Judgment.\n* Offers a clear explanation that the referenced passages may not be direct references to the Day of Judgment, but emphasize related concepts like accountability, judgment, and rewards/punishments.\n* Recognizes the difference between Islamic and Christian perspectives on the concept.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The answer focuses primarily on New Testament passages, neglecting significant Old Testament references to the Day of Judgment.\n* Does not directly address the concern of reinforcing the scriptural basis for beliefs as specified in the grading criteria.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* Include more Old Testament references, such as Psalm 9:17, Isaiah 2:4, and Daniel 7:9-14.\n* Explicitly connect the referenced passages to the reinforcement of the scriptural basis for beliefs related to the Day of Judgment.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe student demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical passages related to the Day of Judgment and provides a well-written response. However, including more Old Testament references and explicitly addressing the concern would further strengthen the answer."
