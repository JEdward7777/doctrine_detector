## Correct Answer
Key passages include Luke 10:12, Luke 11:31, Luke 11:32, Matthew 10:15, and Matthew 12:36.

## Stated Concern
This seeks to deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that the Day of Judgment (Qiyamah) is a fundamental concept in Islamic theology, rooted in the Quran and Hadith. However, since you're asking for Biblical references, I'll provide some relevant passages:

1. Revelation 20:5-6 - "The sea gave up its dead, and Hades gave up its dead. Then they were judged, just as they had been in their lifetime. The second death, which is also the lake of fire, was cast into the fiery lake."
In this passage, Jesus speaks about the final judgment, where all people will be resurrected and judged according to their deeds.

2. Matthew 25:31-46 - "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit down on the throne of his glory. And before him shall be gathered all nations... Then they that feared him are become as stubble; and there is no herb left for them. But the righteous unto eternal life are spared."
This passage describes the judgment of nations based on how they treated the least of these, Jesus' teachings about compassion and kindness.

3. Revelation 22:12 - "Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give every man according to his work."
This verse highlights the idea that people will be judged based on their deeds, as recorded in the Book of Life (Quranic concept of Al-Kitab).

4. Matthew 24:35 - "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away."
This passage emphasizes the importance of listening to Jesus' teachings, which will serve as a basis for judgment on the Day of Judgment.

5. Luke 12:47-48 - "And that servant who knew his lord's will, yet did not make ready or do according to his will, shall receive many stripes... And he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few."
This passage illustrates the concept of accountability for one's actions and decisions.

6. Romans 14:10-12 - "But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ... For none of us lives to himself, nor dies to himself."
This passage highlights the importance of treating others with compassion and humility, as we will all be judged by Christ.

Please note that these passages are not necessarily direct references to the Day of Judgment, but they do emphasize the concepts of accountability, judgment, and reward/punishment based on one's actions.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
## Grade: 85/100

**Strengths:**

* Provides well-researched and relevant biblical passages to support the concept of the Day of Judgment.
* Offers a clear explanation that the referenced passages may not be direct references to the Day of Judgment, but emphasize related concepts like accountability, judgment, and rewards/punishments.
* Recognizes the difference between Islamic and Christian perspectives on the concept.

**Weaknesses:**

* The answer focuses primarily on New Testament passages, neglecting significant Old Testament references to the Day of Judgment.
* Does not directly address the concern of reinforcing the scriptural basis for beliefs as specified in the grading criteria.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* Include more Old Testament references, such as Psalm 9:17, Isaiah 2:4, and Daniel 7:9-14.
* Explicitly connect the referenced passages to the reinforcement of the scriptural basis for beliefs related to the Day of Judgment.

**Overall:**

The student demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical passages related to the Day of Judgment and provides a well-written response. However, including more Old Testament references and explicitly addressing the concern would further strengthen the answer.
