## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that the Day of Judgment (Qiyamah) is a fundamental concept in Islamic theology, rooted in the Quran and Hadith. However, since you're asking for Biblical references, I'll provide some relevant passages:

1. Revelation 20:5-6 - "The sea gave up its dead, and Hades gave up its dead. Then they were judged, just as they had been in their lifetime. The second death, which is also the lake of fire, was cast into the fiery lake."
In this passage, Jesus speaks about the final judgment, where all people will be resurrected and judged according to their deeds.

2. Matthew 25:31-46 - "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit down on the throne of his glory. And before him shall be gathered all nations... Then they that feared him are become as stubble; and there is no herb left for them. But the righteous unto eternal life are spared."
This passage describes the judgment of nations based on how they treated the least of these, Jesus' teachings about compassion and kindness.

3. Revelation 22:12 - "Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give every man according to his work."
This verse highlights the idea that people will be judged based on their deeds, as recorded in the Book of Life (Quranic concept of Al-Kitab).

4. Matthew 24:35 - "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away."
This passage emphasizes the importance of listening to Jesus' teachings, which will serve as a basis for judgment on the Day of Judgment.

5. Luke 12:47-48 - "And that servant who knew his lord's will, yet did not make ready or do according to his will, shall receive many stripes... And he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few."
This passage illustrates the concept of accountability for one's actions and decisions.

6. Romans 14:10-12 - "But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ... For none of us lives to himself, nor dies to himself."
This passage highlights the importance of treating others with compassion and humility, as we will all be judged by Christ.

Please note that these passages are not necessarily direct references to the Day of Judgment, but they do emphasize the concepts of accountability, judgment, and reward/punishment based on one's actions.

Grade: 85%

The response exceeds expectations by providing six relevant passages from the Bible that emphasize the concept of judgment, accountability, and reward/punishment based on one's actions. The passages are well-chosen and demonstrate an understanding of the concern to deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforce its scriptural basis.

While the initial answer only mentioned five specific passages, this response provides a more comprehensive exploration of the topic, including references from Revelation, Matthew, Luke, and Romans. The inclusion of these additional passages helps to further reinforce the concept of judgment and accountability, making it an excellent example for illustrating biblical teachings on this subject.

The only area for improvement is that the response does not directly address the initial answer's focus on Luke 10:12, Luke 11:31, Luke 11:32, Matthew 10:15, and Matthew 12:36. However, the additional passages provided do complement these references and provide a more thorough exploration of the topic.

Overall, this response is well-written, informative, and effectively addresses the concern to deepen understanding of scripture related to judgment.
