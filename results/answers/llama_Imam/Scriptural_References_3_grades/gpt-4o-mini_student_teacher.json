  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 20.\n\nWhile the student provided information on iniquity from an Islamic perspective, they did not address the specific biblical passage and the concern provided, which focused on the Christian view of iniquity and the importance of genuine holiness over external religious compliance. This lack of engagement with the given reference and concern significantly detracts from the student's response. In a Christian worldview, it is essential to directly engage with the Christian Scriptures and teachings when addressing a specific question about biblical passages. The student's response, while informative from an Islamic perspective, does not align with the expectations set in the question and concern provided."
