  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the concept of iniquity from an Islamic perspective. However, it does not directly address the specific passage from Matthew 23:27-28, which was the focus of the question. The student's explanation of the Islamic concepts of Taqwa and haram is insightful, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the passage. Overall, the response provides a valuable exploration of the nature of iniquity from a different religious framework but does not fully address the specific concern related to the Christian worldview."
