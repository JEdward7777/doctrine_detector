  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of the concept of iniquity in Islam and related it well to the importance of Taqwa and accountability to Allah. However, the response did not directly address the specified concern regarding the reminder for Christians to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance. In grading this response, it is important to consider the need for a more explicit engagement with the Christian perspective and the specific concern raised."
