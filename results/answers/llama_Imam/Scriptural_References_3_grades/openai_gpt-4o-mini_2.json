While the specific Christian interpretation of the passage in Matthew is not directly addressed, the response provides valuable insights for Christians on the importance of genuine holiness over external religious compliance. The integration of Islamic teachings with the concern raised shows respect for the Christian worldview, making this a well-rounded response."
