However, there are missed opportunities to delve deeper into the Christian theological implications of birthright, particularly in relation to the covenantal promises and the Messianic lineage. The student's acknowledgment of the differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives is appreciated, but there could have been a more explicit comparison and contrast drawn between the two faith traditions on the concept of birthright. The response is well-structured and informative, but it could benefit from a deeper exploration of the doctrinal significance of birthright within a Christian worldview."
