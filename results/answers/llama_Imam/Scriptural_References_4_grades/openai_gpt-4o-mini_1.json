The incorporation of biblical principles and Christian teachings demonstrates a strong understanding of the relevance of these passages to contemporary Christian life, despite the Islamic scholarly background of the writer. The response effectively addresses the concern by connecting the interpretation of scripture to its practical application for believers today."
