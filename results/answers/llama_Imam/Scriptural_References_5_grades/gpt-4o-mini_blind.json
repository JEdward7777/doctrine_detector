However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies, especially in equating Quranic concepts with biblical teachings. From a Christian perspective, it's crucial to distinguish between the teachings of the Bible and those of the Quran. Additionally, the theological implications and significance of the shift in understanding Hades towards the unrighteous could be more elaborated upon."
