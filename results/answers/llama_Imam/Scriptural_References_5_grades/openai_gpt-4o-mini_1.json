  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the scriptural evidence regarding the nature of Hades in the New Testament and its implications for Christian eschatology. It acknowledges the shift in portrayal of Hades, provides additional verses, and compares it to the Quranic understanding of Barzakh. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian perspective on Hades."
