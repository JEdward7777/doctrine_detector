  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25/100\n\nComments: The response provided lacks doctrinal correctness as it mixes Islamic beliefs with Christian Scriptures in a way that distorts the intended message of the Bible passages. The student attempted to interpret biblical verses, but the integration of Islamic teachings and references to Allah (SWT) and Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) are not appropriate within a Christian worldview grading context. Additionally, some of the interpretations of the biblical passages provided are not entirely accurate. A better response would focus exclusively on the Christian perspective and provide a more accurate and focused analysis of the biblical passages related to foolishness."
