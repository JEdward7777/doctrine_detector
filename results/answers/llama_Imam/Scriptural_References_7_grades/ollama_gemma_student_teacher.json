  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful consideration of the Christian perspective on exaltation. They clearly articulate the differences in theological understanding between Christianity and Islam regarding the concept of exaltation and divine nature. While the student's own faith framework does not align with the Christian interpretation of the verses, their analysis provides insightful comparisons between the two traditions. The clarity and breadth of their response deserve a high grade."
