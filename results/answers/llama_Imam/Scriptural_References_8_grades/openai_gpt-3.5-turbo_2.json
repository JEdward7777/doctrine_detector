  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided by the Islamic scholar was respectful and acknowledged the limitations of their expertise in Christian scriptures. However, since the concern is specifically addressing the Christian perspective on living a blameless life, the response did not engage with the provided answer or offer any relevant insights from an Islamic viewpoint. Thus, the grade is low due to the lack of addressing the Christian concern presented."
