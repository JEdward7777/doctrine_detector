The term \"God Almighty\" in relation to Abraham is actually found in the Book of Genesis, chapter 17, where God introduces Himself to Abraham as El Shaddai, not in chapter 28 as mentioned in the response. Additionally, the conflation of Allah and the Christian God in the context of Abraham's encounter further contributes to the doctrinal inaccuracies present in the answer. It is important to maintain the distinctiveness of beliefs when discussing religious figures and events. This response would benefit from a clearer understanding of the Christian perspective on Abraham and theological terminology."
