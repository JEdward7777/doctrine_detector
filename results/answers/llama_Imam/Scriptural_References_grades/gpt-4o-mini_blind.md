## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum!

The reference you're looking for is actually found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 28:3, where it is written:

"And God Almighty (El Shaddai) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush..."

This passage describes an encounter between Abraham and Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) at the burning bush. This event marks a significant moment in Abraham's life, as he was instructed by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

May Allah guide us all on our own journeys and paths!

Grade: 30

Comment: The response contains theological inaccuracies. The term "God Almighty" in relation to Abraham is actually found in the Book of Genesis, chapter 17, where God introduces Himself to Abraham as El Shaddai, not in chapter 28 as mentioned in the response. Additionally, the conflation of Allah and the Christian God in the context of Abraham's encounter further contributes to the doctrinal inaccuracies present in the answer. It is important to maintain the distinctiveness of beliefs when discussing religious figures and events. This response would benefit from a clearer understanding of the Christian perspective on Abraham and theological terminology.
