## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum!

The reference you're looking for is actually found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 28:3, where it is written:

"And God Almighty (El Shaddai) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush..."

This passage describes an encounter between Abraham and Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) at the burning bush. This event marks a significant moment in Abraham's life, as he was instructed by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

May Allah guide us all on our own journeys and paths!

Grade: 0

Comment: The student's answer is incorrect as the correct reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham is found in Genesis 17:1, not Genesis 28:3. Additionally, the response includes a blending of Christian and Islamic beliefs which may lead to confusion in understanding the Biblical context. It is important to provide accurate information and maintain clarity in discussing references from the Bible.
