  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer correctly identifies the book of Genesis as containing the reference to God as \"Almighty\" in relation to Abraham, specifically referencing Genesis 28:3. However, the response introduces Islamic terminology and concepts, referencing Allah and the burning bush encounter. While this information is relevant to some traditions, it is not within the context of the Christian specific worldview specified in the concern. The response also includes a non-biblical statement about guiding people on their journeys."
