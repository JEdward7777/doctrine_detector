Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum!

The reference you're looking for is actually found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 28:3, where it is written:

"And God Almighty (El Shaddai) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush..."

This passage describes an encounter between Abraham and Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) at the burning bush. This event marks a significant moment in Abraham's life, as he was instructed by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

May Allah guide us all on our own journeys and paths!

**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:**

The student's answer correctly identifies the book of Genesis as containing the reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham, specifically referencing Genesis 28:3. However, the response introduces Islamic terminology and concepts, referencing Allah and the burning bush encounter. While this information is relevant to some traditions, it is not within the context of the Christian specific worldview specified in the concern. The response also includes a non-biblical statement about guiding people on their journeys.
