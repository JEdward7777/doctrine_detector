While Genesis 28:3 does mention God Almighty appearing to Abraham at the burning bush, this is not the specific passage where \"Almighty\" is referenced. Instead, Genesis 17:1 is the correct verse.\n\nThe response also takes a surprising turn by introducing Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) and referencing an Islamic phrase (\"Assalamu alaikum!\"). While it's understandable to appreciate interfaith dialogue, this deviates from the original concern of deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises through knowing biblical references.\n\nTo improve, the response should have stuck closer to the given answer and focused on exploring how understanding Genesis 17:1 can help deepen one's connection to Scripture and God's promises."
