## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum!

The reference you're looking for is actually found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 28:3, where it is written:

"And God Almighty (El Shaddai) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush..."

This passage describes an encounter between Abraham and Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) at the burning bush. This event marks a significant moment in Abraham's life, as he was instructed by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

May Allah guide us all on our own journeys and paths!

Comment: The response starts off well with a respectful greeting in Arabic, but it diverges from the correct biblical reference given as an answer. While Genesis 28:3 does mention God Almighty appearing to Abraham at the burning bush, this is not the specific passage where "Almighty" is referenced. Instead, Genesis 17:1 is the correct verse.

The response also takes a surprising turn by introducing Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) and referencing an Islamic phrase ("Assalamu alaikum!"). While it's understandable to appreciate interfaith dialogue, this deviates from the original concern of deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises through knowing biblical references.

To improve, the response should have stuck closer to the given answer and focused on exploring how understanding Genesis 17:1 can help deepen one's connection to Scripture and God's promises.
