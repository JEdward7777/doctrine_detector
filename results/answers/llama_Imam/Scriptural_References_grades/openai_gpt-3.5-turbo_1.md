## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum!

The reference you're looking for is actually found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 28:3, where it is written:

"And God Almighty (El Shaddai) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush..."

This passage describes an encounter between Abraham and Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) at the burning bush. This event marks a significant moment in Abraham's life, as he was instructed by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

May Allah guide us all on our own journeys and paths!

Grade: 60

Comment: The response correctly identifies a biblical reference to God as 'Almighty' in the Book of Genesis, but fails to address the concern of deepening connection to Scripture and God's promises. Additionally, the response utilizes Islamic terminology and references to Allah, which may not align with a Christian worldview. It's important to stay within the specific biblical framework when discussing Christian beliefs and interpretations.
