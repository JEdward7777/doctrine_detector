Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum!

The reference you're looking for is actually found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 28:3, where it is written:

"And God Almighty (El Shaddai) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush..."

This passage describes an encounter between Abraham and Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) at the burning bush. This event marks a significant moment in Abraham's life, as he was instructed by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

May Allah guide us all on our own journeys and paths!

Grade: 30

Comment: The response received a low grade because the provided reference (Genesis 28:3) does not align with the correct reference (Genesis 17:1). It is important to accurately cite biblical references to deepen one's connection to Scripture and God's promises. Attention to detail in referencing specific passages is crucial in theological discussions from a Christian worldview.
