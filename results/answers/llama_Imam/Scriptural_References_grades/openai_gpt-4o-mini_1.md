The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum!

The reference you're looking for is actually found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 28:3, where it is written:

"And God Almighty (El Shaddai) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush..."

This passage describes an encounter between Abraham and Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) at the burning bush. This event marks a significant moment in Abraham's life, as he was instructed by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

May Allah guide us all on our own journeys and paths!

Grade: 60

Comment: The response demonstrates a good attempt to provide a biblical reference that aligns with the concern of deepening connection to Scripture and God's promises. However, the confusion between the encounter at the burning bush with Moses and the reference to God as 'Almighty' in Genesis 17:1 is a significant error. It is important to accurately reference the specific verses and events in the Bible to maintain theological coherence and understanding.
