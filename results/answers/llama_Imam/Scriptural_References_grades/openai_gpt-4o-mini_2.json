  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response correctly identifies a reference in the Book of Genesis where God is referred to as 'Almighty', there is a concerning mixing of religious beliefs in the response provided, specifically referencing both Allah and God Almighty (El Shaddai) interchangeably within a Christian biblical context. It is important to maintain doctrinal accuracy and clarity when discussing biblical references and the nature of God in a Christian worldview. This response may cause confusion or promote syncretism among believers."
