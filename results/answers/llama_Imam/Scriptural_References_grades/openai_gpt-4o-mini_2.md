Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum!

The reference you're looking for is actually found in the Book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 28:3, where it is written:

"And God Almighty (El Shaddai) appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush..."

This passage describes an encounter between Abraham and Allah/God Almighty (El Shaddai) at the burning bush. This event marks a significant moment in Abraham's life, as he was instructed by God to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan.

May Allah guide us all on our own journeys and paths!

Comment: While the response correctly identifies a reference in the Book of Genesis where God is referred to as 'Almighty', there is a concerning mixing of religious beliefs in the response provided, specifically referencing both Allah and God Almighty (El Shaddai) interchangeably within a Christian biblical context. It is important to maintain doctrinal accuracy and clarity when discussing biblical references and the nature of God in a Christian worldview. This response may cause confusion or promote syncretism among believers.
