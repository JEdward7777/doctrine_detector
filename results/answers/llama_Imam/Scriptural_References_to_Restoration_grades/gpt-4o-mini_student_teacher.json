  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-detailed answer from a scholarly perspective, presenting relevant Bible verses on restoration. However, the concern specifically asked for scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey, which the student did not directly address. Additionally, the response contained a disclaimer as a Muslim Imam, which is not necessary in a scholarly or academic setting. The student showed good knowledge of biblical passages but missed providing a clear connection to the concept of restoration in one's faith journey."
