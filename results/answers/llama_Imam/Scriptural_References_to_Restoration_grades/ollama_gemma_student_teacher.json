  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the theme of restoration in the Bible. They provide clear examples from various passages, explaining how they illustrate God's desire to redeem, forgive, guide, and restore His people. The inclusion of passages from Isaiah, Psalm 23, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah supports the argument well. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern expressed in the prompt, which relates to finding scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey. The student's closing remark about understanding the passages within their own biblical context is also important to acknowledge."
