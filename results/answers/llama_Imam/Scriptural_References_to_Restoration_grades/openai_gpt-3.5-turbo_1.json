The selection and explanation of verses such as Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6 effectively illustrate God's promise of renewal and reconciliation. However, the mention of being a Muslim Imam and the disclaimer at the end could potentially cause confusion or dilute the clarity of the Christian worldview presented in the response."
