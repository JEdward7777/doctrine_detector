The examples provided offer a clear connection between the concept of restoration and one's faith journey. The explanation is well-supported with relevant Bible verses and analysis, showcasing a deep understanding of the topic. The only area for improvement would be to include a more explicit connection to the concern of finding scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey in each example provided."
