The answer focused more on Islamic teachings rather than directly addressing the question from a Christian perspective. It would have been helpful to reference relevant Bible passages like 1 Timothy 4:2 and provide a more thorough analysis from a Christian worldview. Additionally, while drawing parallels between Islamic and Christian teachings can be insightful, it's important to prioritize addressing the question within the Christian framework."
