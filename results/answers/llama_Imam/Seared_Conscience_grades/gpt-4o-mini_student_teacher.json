  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of a \"seared\" conscience, drawing parallels between Islamic teachings and the Christian understanding presented in the Bible. However, the response lacked direct reference to the insensitivity to sin aspect highlighted in the reference answer. While the student made insightful connections and reflections for believers, a stronger focus on the specific implications related to insensitivity to sin would have further enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
