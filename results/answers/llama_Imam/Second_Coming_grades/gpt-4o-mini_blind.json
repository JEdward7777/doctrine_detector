  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful comparison between Christian and Islamic perspectives on the concept of the \"Son of Man\" and offers insights into how each tradition interprets eschatological expectations. The explanation of Jesus' statement and its potential meaning for believers from both perspectives is well articulated. However, the grade is lowered due to the assertion that Jesus is not the Son of God or a divine being, as this contradicts core Christian doctrine. Additionally, the comparison with the Mahdi, while informative, may not align with Christian teachings regarding the return of Jesus as the Son of Man. A more accurate portrayal of Christian beliefs, emphasizing Jesus' divinity and role in eschatological events, would lead to a higher grade."
