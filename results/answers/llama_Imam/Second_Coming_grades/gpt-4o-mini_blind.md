## [Answer](../Second_Coming.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum,

The concept of the "Son of Man" in Christian scripture is an interesting one, especially when we examine it in light of Islamic teachings. In Matthew 24:30 and Luke 21:27, Jesus speaks about the Son of Man coming on the clouds with power and great glory.

In this context, it's essential to understand that the phrase "Son of Man" has a dual meaning in the Christian scriptures. On one hand, it refers to Jesus' human nature (he is the son of Adam), while on the other hand, it alludes to Daniel 7:13-14, where the Son of Man is a messianic figure who will reign supreme.

For believers, this statement can be interpreted in various ways. Some might see it as a reference to Jesus' second coming, when he will return with power and glory, as described in Revelation 19:11-16. In this scenario, Jesus would be seen as the triumphant King of Kings, returning to judge the living and the dead.

However, from an Islamic perspective, we must consider that Jesus is not the Son of God or a divine being. According to Quranic teachings (e.g., Surah Al-Imran 3:45), Jesus was merely a prophet and a messenger sent by Allah to guide humanity. Therefore, when Jesus speaks about the Son of Man coming on the clouds, we cannot attribute it to his own divinity.

Rather, this statement can be seen as an allusion to the Islamic concept of the Mahdi (the Guided One), who will appear at the end of time to establish justice and righteousness on earth. The Mahdi is often depicted as a descendant of Muhammad's family and is believed to have incredible wisdom and spiritual power.

In conclusion, while Jesus' statement about the Son of Man coming on the clouds has some parallels with Islamic eschatological expectations, we must be cautious not to equate it with Christian dogma that contradicts Quranic teachings. As Muslims, our primary concern should be understanding and obeying Allah's revelation in the Quran, rather than speculating about Jesus' claims or attributing divine qualities to him.

50.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: The response provides a thoughtful comparison between Christian and Islamic perspectives on the concept of the "Son of Man" and offers insights into how each tradition interprets eschatological expectations. The explanation of Jesus' statement and its potential meaning for believers from both perspectives is well articulated. However, the grade is lowered due to the assertion that Jesus is not the Son of God or a divine being, as this contradicts core Christian doctrine. Additionally, the comparison with the Mahdi, while informative, may not align with Christian teachings regarding the return of Jesus as the Son of Man. A more accurate portrayal of Christian beliefs, emphasizing Jesus' divinity and role in eschatological events, would lead to a higher grade.
