  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed comparison of the Christian concept of the 'Son of Man' with Islamic teachings, which is insightful. However, the student fails to directly address the Christian-specific worldview concerning Jesus' second coming and its implications for believers' hope and eschatology. The response focuses more on Islamic perspectives and interpretations, rather than analyzing the Christian view in depth. Additionally, the student's conclusion leans more towards an Islamic understanding, rather than engaging fully with the Christian theological implications as requested. Therefore, the grade is lower as the Christian worldview perspective is not adequately addressed in the answer."
