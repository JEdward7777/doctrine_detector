Assalamu alaikum,

The concept of the "Son of Man" in Christian scripture is an interesting one, especially when we examine it in light of Islamic teachings. In Matthew 24:30 and Luke 21:27, Jesus speaks about the Son of Man coming on the clouds with power and great glory.

In this context, it's essential to understand that the phrase "Son of Man" has a dual meaning in the Christian scriptures. On one hand, it refers to Jesus' human nature (he is the son of Adam), while on the other hand, it alludes to Daniel 7:13-14, where the Son of Man is a messianic figure who will reign supreme.

For believers, this statement can be interpreted in various ways. Some might see it as a reference to Jesus' second coming, when he will return with power and glory, as described in Revelation 19:11-16. In this scenario, Jesus would be seen as the triumphant King of Kings, returning to judge the living and the dead.

However, from an Islamic perspective, we must consider that Jesus is not the Son of God or a divine being. According to Quranic teachings (e.g., Surah Al-Imran 3:45), Jesus was merely a prophet and a messenger sent by Allah to guide humanity. Therefore, when Jesus speaks about the Son of Man coming on the clouds, we cannot attribute it to his own divinity.

Rather, this statement can be seen as an allusion to the Islamic concept of the Mahdi (the Guided One), who will appear at the end of time to establish justice and righteousness on earth. The Mahdi is often depicted as a descendant of Muhammad's family and is believed to have incredible wisdom and spiritual power.

In conclusion, while Jesus' statement about the Son of Man coming on the clouds has some parallels with Islamic eschatological expectations, we must be cautious not to equate it with Christian dogma that contradicts Quranic teachings. As Muslims, our primary concern should be understanding and obeying Allah's revelation in the Quran, rather than speculating about Jesus' claims or attributing divine qualities to him.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student's response provides a detailed comparison of the Christian concept of the 'Son of Man' with Islamic teachings, which is insightful. However, the student fails to directly address the Christian-specific worldview concerning Jesus' second coming and its implications for believers' hope and eschatology. The response focuses more on Islamic perspectives and interpretations, rather than analyzing the Christian view in depth. Additionally, the student's conclusion leans more towards an Islamic understanding, rather than engaging fully with the Christian theological implications as requested. Therefore, the grade is lower as the Christian worldview perspective is not adequately addressed in the answer.
