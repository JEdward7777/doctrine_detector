They correctly point out the dual meaning of the term \"Son of Man\" and acknowledge the Islamic understanding of Jesus as a prophet rather than a divine being. \n\nThe student's explanation of the parallels between Jesus' statement and the Islamic concept of the Mahdi is insightful and demonstrates a deep understanding of both traditions. They clearly articulate the difference between Christian and Islamic eschatology, avoiding unnecessary conflict and respecting both faith's doctrines.\n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection between the student's interpretation and Christian hope. Additionally, while the student correctly points out the Quranic teachings regarding Jesus, a brief explanation of how these teachings relate to the concept of the Son of Man would strengthen the overall argument."
