  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed analysis of the concept of the \"Son of Man\" in Christian scripture and Islamic teachings, acknowledging the implications for both faith traditions. However, it focuses more on the Islamic perspective and the concept of the Mahdi rather than specifically addressing the Christian hope and eschatology related to Jesus' second coming as the \"Son of Man\". While it offers valuable insights, it does not fully address the concern provided, resulting in a lower grade."
