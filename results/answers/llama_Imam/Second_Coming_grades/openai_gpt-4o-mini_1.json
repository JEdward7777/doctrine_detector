However, the focus seemed more on Islamic beliefs rather than fully delving into the implications of Jesus' second coming as the Son of Man from a Christian perspective. The response could have further emphasized the significance of Jesus' return for Christians in terms of redemption, judgment, and the establishment of God's kingdom on Earth."
