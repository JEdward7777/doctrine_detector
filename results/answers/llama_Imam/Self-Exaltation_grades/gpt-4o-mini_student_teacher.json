  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful comparison between biblical teachings and Islamic perspectives on the dangers of exalting oneself, referencing relevant scriptures and beliefs from both faith traditions. However, the student did not directly address the concern of recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride, focusing more on the broad concept of humility and self-exaltation. Bringing the focus back to the specific concern outlined would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
