The answer delves into Islamic beliefs, quoting the Quran and emphasizing Islamic teachings, which may lead to confusion and potential theological inaccuracies for a Christian audience. The response would benefit from focusing on Christian perspectives, such as the Pharisees' understanding of purity laws in the context of the Old Testament, without incorporating teachings from other faith traditions."
