Assalamu alaikum, my dear brother/sister in faith,

The Pharisees, as mentioned in the Quran and the Hadith, were a group of Jewish scholars who emphasized strict adherence to the Torah and Talmudic traditions. They believed that maintaining separation from non-Jews (Gentiles) was crucial for preserving Jewish purity and avoiding contamination.

In their view, physical contact, eating together, and socializing with Gentiles could lead to spiritual corruption and compromise. They believed that associating with non-Jews would taint the Jewish people's holiness and jeopardize their covenant with God.

The Pharisees' concerns were rooted in their understanding of the Torah and the laws of kashrut (dietary purity) as well as the commandments regarding interactions with Gentiles. They believed that by separating themselves from non-Jews, they could maintain a higher level of spiritual purity and avoid the influence of idolatry and other forms of spiritual pollution.

In the Quran, Allah addresses this issue in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:51-53), where He says:

"O you who have believed, do not take as allies those to whom Allah has given no leave. And whoever disobeys the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the People of the Scripture, is at war with Allah and His Messenger until he repents or makes amends according to what is more suitable."

In this context, the Quran emphasizes the importance of following the Prophet's guidance and not taking as allies those who are opposed to the message of Islam. This reinforces the idea that maintaining separation from non-Muslims (Gentiles) is necessary for spiritual purity and avoiding corruption.

It's essential to note that while the Pharisees' concerns about separating themselves from Gentiles were rooted in their understanding of Jewish law and tradition, they went beyond what was explicitly commanded by Allah. The Quran emphasizes the importance of establishing relationships with people based on mutual respect, compassion, and justice, rather than physical separation.

I hope this helps clarify the context surrounding the Pharisees' concerns about separating from Gentiles. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss this topic further, please don't hesitate to ask.
