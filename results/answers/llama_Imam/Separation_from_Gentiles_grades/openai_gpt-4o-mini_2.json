However, the Christian worldview would highlight the importance of relationships based on love, compassion, and justice, rather than strict physical separation as emphasized by the Pharisees. In a diverse cultural context, Christians are called to engage with people of different beliefs and backgrounds in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect, rather than isolation. It's important to consider how Jesus interacted with people from all walks of life, demonstrating love and inclusion rather than exclusion based on religious differences."
