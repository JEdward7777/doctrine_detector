  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that focuses on the Islamic perspective regarding the story of the rainbow as a sign of God's covenant. While the explanation is detailed and insightful, the answer strays from the Christian worldview by heavily emphasizing Islamic beliefs and interpretations. The grade reflects the comprehensive understanding of the covenant concept but deducts points for the lack of direct engagement with the Christian interpretation and understanding of God's covenant in the Bible."
