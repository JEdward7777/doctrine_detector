However, it deviates from a Christian worldview by emphasizing Islamic beliefs about Jesus rather than focusing on the specifically Christian interpretation of the event. The response correctly points out the differences in beliefs between Islam and Christianity regarding Jesus, but it does not adequately address the Christian understanding of the significance of the sign for the shepherds in relation to the birth of Jesus. More emphasis on Christian doctrine and theology would be beneficial in this context."
