It effectively addresses the concern by discussing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs within the context of Christian theology while maintaining the Islamic perspective on Jesus as a prophet. The response could have further elaborated on how the sign of the baby in the manger specifically fulfilled prophecies in the Old Testament, which would have strengthened the argument."
