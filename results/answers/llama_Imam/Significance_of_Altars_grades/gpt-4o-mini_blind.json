However, from a Christian worldview, there are some doctrinal differences concerning the understanding of sacrifice, atonement, and the purpose of altars. The answer could have been improved by including more specific references to Old Testament Scriptures and the sacrificial system established by God for the Israelites. Additionally, a clearer distinction between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding sacrifice and atonement could have strengthened the response."
