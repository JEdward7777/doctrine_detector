They effectively highlighted the spiritual and symbolic meanings of the altar, its role in covenant-making, atonement, and communal worship. However, the response focused more on the similarities between Islamic and Israelite practices rather than directly addressing the concern of understanding the importance of altars in biblical worship from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, it would have been beneficial for the student to specifically address how the concept of sacrifice and devotion in ancient Israelite worship can help Christians appreciate their faith."
