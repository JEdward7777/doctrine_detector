The explanation of the roles of each anointed individual is accurate, and the connection between anointing and divine appointments is highlighted. However, the response mixes Christian and Islamic terminology and worldview, which may confuse readers seeking a Christian-specific understanding. Additionally, the reference to \"Allah\" instead of \"God\" may be off-putting to those seeking a distinctly Christian perspective on the topic. To improve, focus on presenting the information within a Christian framework without interweaving terminology and beliefs from other faiths."
