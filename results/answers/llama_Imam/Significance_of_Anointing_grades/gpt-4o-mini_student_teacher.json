However, the use of Islamic greetings and references to Allah instead of the Christian perspective of God may confuse the reader and detract from the Christian-specific worldview required for this question. Additionally, the student could have been more concise and focused on emphasizing the divine empowerment aspect of anointing, as it was the main point of significance in biblical leadership roles."
