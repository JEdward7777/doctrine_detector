  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's response acknowledges the significance of the term \"Shaddai\" and its translation as a title rather than a name, there are theological inaccuracies and misalignments with a Christian worldview. The mixing of Islamic theology and practices with Christian beliefs may lead to confusion for readers and does not accurately reflect Christian doctrine. In grading this response, priority is given to doctrinal correctness within a Christian framework."
