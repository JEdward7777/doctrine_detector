## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

Assalamu alaikum (peace be upon you).

In the Quran, we read about Allah's names and attributes, including His mercy, justice, and wisdom. Similarly, in the Bible, the name "Shaddai" is often translated as a title rather than a name because it carries specific connotations and implications.

In Hebrew, "Shaddai" (שַׁדַּי) means "The All-Sufficient One" or "The Almighty." It's often used in the Old Testament to describe God's power, strength, and ability to fulfill His promises. When translated as a title rather than a name, it emphasizes God's attributes and actions rather than His personal identity.

In Islamic theology, we believe that Allah has 99 names, each with its own unique meaning and significance. Similarly, in Jewish tradition, the name "Shaddai" is seen as an attribute of God's power and sovereignty. By translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name, it highlights God's role as the All-Sufficient One, emphasizing His ability to meet human needs and fulfill His promises.

In this context, it's interesting to note that many Bible translations use phrases like "the Almighty" or "the Lord of Hosts" instead of a personal name for God. This reflects the Hebraic concept of God's power and authority, which is often tied to His role as creator, sustainer, and redeemer.

In conclusion, translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations underscores God's attributes and actions, emphasizing His power, strength, and ability to fulfill His promises. As Muslims, we can appreciate the Hebraic concept of God's names and attributes, which shares some commonalities with our own understanding of Allah's 99 names.

Was-salamu alaikum (peace be upon you).

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's answer as 50/100.

While the student provides some relevant information about the meaning of "Shaddai" and its significance in both Islamic and Jewish traditions, the answer lacks a specific focus on the Christian faith. The response does not directly address the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect within the Christian faith. Additionally, the student's answer does not draw a clear connection between translating "Shaddai" as a title and its impact on understanding God's attributes and relational aspect in Christianity. The connection to the Christian worldview is essential in this context, which is missing in the student's answer.

The answer also strays off-topic by discussing Islamic theology and the concept of Allah's 99 names, which, while interesting, does not directly address the Christian perspective on the significance of translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations.

Overall, the student's response lacks a clear Christian-specific focus and does not effectively address the given concern, leading to a lower grade.
