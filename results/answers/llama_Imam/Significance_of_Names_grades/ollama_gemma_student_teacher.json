  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 90\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological significance of the translation of \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations from a Christian perspective. The response accurately explains the Hebraic concept of God's power and authority, emphasizing the emphasis on attributes and actions rather than a personal identity. The inclusion of Islamic theological concepts and parallels to Allah's 99 names adds depth and nuance to the analysis."
