Assalamu alaikum (peace be upon you).

In the Quran, we read about Allah's names and attributes, including His mercy, justice, and wisdom. Similarly, in the Bible, the name "Shaddai" is often translated as a title rather than a name because it carries specific connotations and implications.

In Hebrew, "Shaddai" (שַׁדַּי) means "The All-Sufficient One" or "The Almighty." It's often used in the Old Testament to describe God's power, strength, and ability to fulfill His promises. When translated as a title rather than a name, it emphasizes God's attributes and actions rather than His personal identity.

In Islamic theology, we believe that Allah has 99 names, each with its own unique meaning and significance. Similarly, in Jewish tradition, the name "Shaddai" is seen as an attribute of God's power and sovereignty. By translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name, it highlights God's role as the All-Sufficient One, emphasizing His ability to meet human needs and fulfill His promises.

In this context, it's interesting to note that many Bible translations use phrases like "the Almighty" or "the Lord of Hosts" instead of a personal name for God. This reflects the Hebraic concept of God's power and authority, which is often tied to His role as creator, sustainer, and redeemer.

In conclusion, translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations underscores God's attributes and actions, emphasizing His power, strength, and ability to fulfill His promises. As Muslims, we can appreciate the Hebraic concept of God's names and attributes, which shares some commonalities with our own understanding of Allah's 99 names.

Was-salamu alaikum (peace be upon you).

Comment: The response provides a thorough and insightful exploration of the significance of translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name in highlighting God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength. It also draws parallels between the Christian understanding of God's character and the Islamic belief in Allah's 99 names. The response effectively addresses the concern by showcasing how the translation choice can impact one's perception of God's relational aspect in the Christian faith. Well done!
