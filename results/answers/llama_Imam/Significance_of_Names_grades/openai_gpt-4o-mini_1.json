It acknowledges the importance of emphasizing God's characteristics and power. However, it lacks a direct connection to deepening the understanding of God's relational aspect in the Christian faith, which would have further strengthened the analysis from a Christian worldview. A more explicit link to the relational aspect of God in Christianity would have significantly enhanced the response."
