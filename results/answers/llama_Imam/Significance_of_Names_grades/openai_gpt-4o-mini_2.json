It also draws a connection between the Hebraic concept of God's power and sovereignty with the Christian understanding of God's character. However, the response could have further explored the relational aspect of God in the Christian faith, emphasizing the personal relationship believers have with God through Jesus Christ. Additionally, there could have been more explicit references to Christian theology and scripture to strengthen the argument."
