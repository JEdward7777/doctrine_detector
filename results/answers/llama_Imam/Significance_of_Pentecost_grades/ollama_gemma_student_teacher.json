  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a clear understanding of the significance of the Day of Pentecost from a Christian perspective. They provide a concise explanation of the event and its importance in fulfilling Jesus' promise of the Holy Spirit. They also highlight the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering the disciples for ministry and establishing the Christian Church. The response is well-written and clearly articulated, though it does not address the specific concern regarding the understanding of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers from a Christian worldview."
