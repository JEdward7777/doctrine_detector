The Christian perspective views unleavened bread as symbolizing the removal of sin and living a life that honors God, not solely as a symbol of purity and freedom from sin. The response lacked the crucial Christian theological understanding that is integral to interpreting the symbolism of unleavened bread in relation to sin and honoring God."
