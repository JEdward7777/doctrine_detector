  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the role of signs and miracles in proving the truth of God's message, specifically focusing on Jesus and the apostles. The response effectively ties in Islamic beliefs and references to support the argument. However, there is a departure from the Christian worldview in terms of defining the purpose of miracles. From a Christian perspective, miracles are seen as validations of God's power and authority, rather than just serving as evidence for the authenticity of the prophet's message. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a deep understanding of the role of signs and miracles within their Islamic context."
