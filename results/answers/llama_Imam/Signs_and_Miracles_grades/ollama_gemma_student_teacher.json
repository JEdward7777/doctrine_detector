The student clearly articulates the Islamic belief that signs and miracles are not primarily intended to prove the prophethood itself, but rather to authenticate the prophet's message and demonstrate their connection to Allah. The student also provides relevant examples from the Quran and Acts to support their arguments. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful response."
