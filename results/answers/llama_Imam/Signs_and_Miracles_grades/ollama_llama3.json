  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation in Islam. The writer provides a clear explanation of Islamic perspectives on signs and miracles, highlighting their role in demonstrating the prophet's connection to Allah (SWT) and His approval of their mission. The inclusion of Quranic verses adds depth and authority to the discussion.\n\nThe response also engages with the specified answer by emphasizing that signs and miracles serve as validations of God's power and authority, which aligns with Islamic teachings. However, there is room for further exploration on this topic. For instance, a more nuanced discussion on the nature of faith and its relationship with signs and miracles could have been provided.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of signs and miracles in Islam, exploring how they intersect with faith and God's revelation. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of Islamic perspectives on this topic and provides a clear, coherent discussion."
