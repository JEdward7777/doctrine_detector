Assalamu alaikum brother, I'm happy to discuss this topic with you.

In Islamic perspective, we believe that Allah (SWT) has sent many prophets and messengers throughout history, including Jesus (peace be upon him). While Islam does not have a concept of miracles as some other faiths do, we do recognize the importance of signs and wonders in proving the truth of God's message.

According to Islamic tradition, the role of signs and miracles is not to prove the prophethood or messengership itself, but rather to serve as evidence for the authenticity and authority of the prophet's message. In other words, they are meant to demonstrate the prophet's connection to Allah (SWT) and His approval of the prophet's mission.

In the case of Jesus (peace be upon him), we believe that his miracles and signs were a manifestation of his prophethood and a demonstration of his trust in Allah (SWT). As mentioned in the Quran, Jesus performed many miracles, including bringing forth water from the palm of his hand, healing the blind and the leper, and raising the dead (Quran 5:110-112).

Similarly, the apostles of Jesus, such as Peter and John, also performed miracles to demonstrate their connection to Allah (SWT) and the authority of Jesus' message. For example, in Acts 3:1-10, Peter healed a lame man, and in Acts 14:8-18, Paul healed a blind man.

In Islamic perspective, we believe that these signs and miracles were not meant to be worshipped or elevated above the prophet's message, but rather to serve as a demonstration of Allah's power and wisdom. As the Quran says, "And those who believe and the Jews and the Christians and Sabaeans - whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and approves of what has been sent down to His Messenger - they fear not from among them shouldering the burden (of responsibility) for their deeds." (Quran 5:69)

In conclusion, while Islam does not have a concept of miracles as some other faiths do, we recognize the importance of signs and wonders in proving the truth of God's message. The role of these signs is to demonstrate the prophet's connection to Allah (SWT) and His approval of their mission, rather than to prove the prophethood or messengership itself.

May Allah guide us all to the straight path and may we be grateful for the many blessings He has bestowed upon us. Ameen.
