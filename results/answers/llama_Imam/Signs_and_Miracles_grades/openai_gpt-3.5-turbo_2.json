  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a thoughtful examination of the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation from an Islamic perspective. The student effectively connects the significance of signs and miracles to validating God's power and authority, particularly in the context of Jesus and the apostles. The explanation is well-reasoned and demonstrates an understanding of how these miraculous events support the authenticity of the prophets' message within the Islamic faith. The response could have delved deeper into the specific Biblical examples of miracles mentioned by addressing them from an Islamic viewpoint, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
