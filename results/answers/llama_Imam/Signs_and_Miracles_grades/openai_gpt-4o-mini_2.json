The integration of Quranic references and examples from Islamic tradition strengthens the argument. However, from a Christian specific worldview, the response does not address the unique understanding of miracles in Christianity, such as the concept of miracles being a manifestation of God's power and direct intervention in the world to affirm the divinity of Jesus Christ. A stronger connection to Christian beliefs on miracles and their significance in validating the divine nature of Jesus would have been beneficial."
