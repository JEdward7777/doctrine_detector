Assalamu alaikum (peace be upon you),

The title "Son of God" (Ibn Allah) is a concept unique to Christianity, specifically referring to Jesus Christ. In Islam, we do not attribute this title to any human being, including Jesus. Instead, we believe that Jesus was a noble prophet and messenger of God, but he was not divine.

In the Quran, we read: "And behold! The angels said: 'O Mary, Allah hath chosen thee and purified thee—chosen thee above all women' (Quran 3:42)." This verse emphasizes Jesus's prophetic status, rather than his divinity.

The term "sons of God" (Bani Allah) in Islam refers to believers who have attained the rank of sons or children of God through their faith and good deeds. This is based on Quranic verses such as: "And those who believe and those who are Jews, and the Christians and Sabaeans— whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous deeds—will be rewarded by their Lord; they will not fear nor have any regret" (Quran 2:62).

In Islamic theology, believers become sons of God through their faith, good deeds, and obedience to His commands. This is a state of spiritual closeness and intimacy with Allah, where one's actions are guided by the principles of Islam.

In contrast, the Christian concept of Jesus as the "Son of God" implies a more profound and essential connection between Jesus and God. Christians believe that Jesus was eternally begotten of God, sharing His divine nature, whereas Muslims see Jesus as a human prophet who conveyed God's message to humanity.

To summarize, while both terms refer to a special relationship with God, the "Son of God" in Christianity is unique to Jesus Christ, whereas "sons of God" in Islam refers to believers who have attained a high spiritual status through their faith and good deeds.
