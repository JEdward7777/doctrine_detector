However, it falls short in lacking a deeper explanation of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity and the significance of Jesus' relationship with God the Father. Additionally, while presenting the Islamic perspective, the response could have delved further into the reasons why Muslims reject the concept of Jesus as the Son of God according to Islamic theology."
