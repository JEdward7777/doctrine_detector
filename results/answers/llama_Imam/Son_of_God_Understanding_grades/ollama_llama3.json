However, it does not directly address the concern about the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God. The response mainly focuses on refuting the Christian concept of the Trinity and emphasizing the unity of Allah in Islam. While it mentions that Muslims believe Jesus was a human prophet sent by Allah, it does not provide any insight into the nature of Jesus' relationship with God or whether He is considered divine. To better address the concern, the response could have explored Jesus' divinity and His eternal relationship with God from an Islamic perspective."
