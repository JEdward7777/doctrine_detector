  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 90\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the theological distinction between the title \"Son of God\" and the term \"sons of God\" from both Christian and Islamic perspectives. They clearly explain the unique nature of Jesus' divine sonship and differentiate it from the spiritual closeness attainable by believers through faith and good deeds. The response is well-reasoned and articulates the theological concepts accurately."
