  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the distinction between the Christian concept of Jesus as the \"Son of God\" and the broader term \"sons of God\" for believers. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the theological differences between the two concepts, aiding in avoiding confusion in discussions comparing Christianity and Islam. The response is well-written, respectful, and informative, from the perspective of an Islamic worldview."
