  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the distinction between the Christian concept of Jesus as the \"Son of God\" and the broader term \"sons of God\" for believers. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the theological differences between the two concepts, thereby avoiding confusion in discussions comparing Christian and Islamic beliefs. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the theological nuances and provides a comprehensive comparison between the Christian and Islamic perspectives."
