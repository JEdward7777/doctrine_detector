  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in the context of Genesis 6. However, as an Imam, the student's focus should primarily be on Islamic theology and providing insights from an Islamic perspective rather than delving extensively into interpretations from biblical scholars and theologians. Additionally, while the response offers valuable information, it lacks a clear integration of a Christian specific worldview or the doctrinal correctness expected when discussing biblical interpretations."
