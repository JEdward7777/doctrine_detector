  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided detailed explanations of different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in the Bible, the response did not align with the specific concern of understanding biblical interpretation to grasp the meaning of scripture passages. Additionally, as an Imam, the focus should have been more on providing an analysis from a Christian worldview rather than emphasizing Islamic theology. Further integration of Christian perspectives and a more focused response would have improved the grade."
