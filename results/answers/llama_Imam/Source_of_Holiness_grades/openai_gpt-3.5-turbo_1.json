It clearly articulates the Islamic perspective on achieving spiritual excellence. However, it could have more directly addressed the concern by emphasizing the central role of faith in Jesus as the source of holiness for Christians. It could have also elaborated more on the importance of faith in Jesus as the defining factor in Christian doctrine of sainthood."
