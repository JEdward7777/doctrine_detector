The student acknowledges the difference in beliefs regarding the source of holiness between Islam and Christianity. However, the response does not directly address the concern about clarifying the central role of faith in Jesus Christ in the Christian doctrine. It would have been beneficial to explicitly connect the Christian belief in the saving work of Jesus Christ to the concept of sainthood in order to fully address the concern."
