However, it does not address the concern provided, which emphasized the central role of faith in Jesus Christ in Christian doctrine. The response solely focuses on deeds and obedience rather than emphasizing the source of holiness through faith in Jesus Christ. More integration of the specified concern into the response would have strengthened the evaluation."
