  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response makes a commendable effort to address the question from a Christian perspective despite being written from a Muslim Imam's viewpoint. The student acknowledges the theological differences between Christianity and Islam, which is a good starting point. However, the student's attempt to provide an answer based on Biblical teaching falls short in doctrinal accuracy. The answer correctly highlights the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities, referencing relevant Bible verses. However, there are some misinterpretations and a lack of depth in the explanation of these concepts from a Biblical standpoint. Additionally, while the inclusion of Islamic perspectives is informative, it detracts from focusing solely on the requested Biblical teaching. To improve the grade, the student should delve deeper into the Biblical understanding of spiritual and earthly authorities and avoid interweaving comparative religious perspectives."
