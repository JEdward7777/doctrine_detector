The inclusion of relevant Quranic verses and Hadiths adds depth to the answer, showcasing a good understanding of Islamic theology on this topic. The response could have further emphasized the doctrinal importance of repentance and seeking refuge in Allah to combat the influence of demons. Overall, a well-informed and well-expressed response."
