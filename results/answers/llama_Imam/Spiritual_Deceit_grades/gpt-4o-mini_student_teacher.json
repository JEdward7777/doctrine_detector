  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-informed response about the Islamic perspective on demons (Shayateen) and their role in deceiving people into idolatry. However, the concern specified that the grading should be based on a Christian specific worldview. The student did not address the Christian perspective on demons deceiving people into believing in false gods and idols, which is the focus of the concern provided. In a Christian worldview, demons play a role in promoting idolatry by leading people away from the truth of God's sovereignty, similar to how Shayateen deceive people in the Islamic perspective. The response could have been improved by integrating Christian teachings on this topic."
