It aligns well with the Christian concern of being vigilant against influences that lead believers away from the truth of God's sovereignty. The response effectively highlights the importance for Muslims to be aware of these tactics and to rely on faith in Allah. However, from a Christian specific worldview, the acknowledgment of Yahweh as the one true God could have been more explicitly emphasized within the context of the response."
