  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 60.\n\nWhile the student demonstrates an attempt to provide insights from an Islamic perspective regarding spiritual gifts, the answer lacks a clear connection to the given concern. The concern emphasized the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit within a Christian worldview, which the student did not directly address or relate back to the importance of utilizing one's gifts for community growth and obedience to God in an Islamic context.\n\nAdditionally, the student correctly acknowledges the differences in theological frameworks between Christianity and Islam but could have further emphasized the specific biblical significance of spiritual gifts as described in the reference answer, and how this relates to community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit within a Christian worldview.\n\nOverall, the response shows an attempt to engage with the topic, but it could benefit from further development and a clearer connection to the specific concern provided."
