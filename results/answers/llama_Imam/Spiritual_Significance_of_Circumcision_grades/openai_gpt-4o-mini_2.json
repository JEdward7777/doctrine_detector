The answer effectively addresses the concern by linking the physical practice of circumcision in the Old Testament to its spiritual significance in Christianity. However, it could have been strengthened by delving deeper into the sacramental aspect of circumcision within Christian theology and how it points towards the believer's union with Christ. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful perspective from an Islamic scholar on Christian beliefs."
