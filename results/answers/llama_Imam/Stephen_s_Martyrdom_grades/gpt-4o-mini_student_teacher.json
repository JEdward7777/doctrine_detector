  "grade": 55.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 55.\n\nWhile the student accurately discusses the significance of Stephen's stoning in early Christian history and the challenges faced by early believers, there are significant foundational differences in worldview between Islam and Christianity that are not addressed. The student's perspective does not fully engage with the Christian-specific concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and faithfulness in the face of persecution. Additionally, while the student attempts to promote dialogue and understanding between faiths, the focus on Islamic theology and perspectives may be distracting in a Christian-specific context. A more direct engagement with the Christian worldview and teachings on martyrdom and faithfulness would have strengthened the response."
