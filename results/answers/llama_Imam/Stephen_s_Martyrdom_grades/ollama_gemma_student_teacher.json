The response thoughtfully explores the tensions between early Christians and their Jewish contemporaries, the internal divisions within the Christian community, and the external persecution faced by believers. Additionally, the student provides insightful parallels between the stoning of Stephen and the experiences of prophets and companions in Islamic theology. The response is well-written and demonstrates respect for both Christian and Muslim traditions."
