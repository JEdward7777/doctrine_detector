It effectively highlighted the commitment of early Christians to stand firm in their beliefs despite the threat of death. The inclusion of parallels with Islamic theology was insightful and added depth to the analysis. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the Christian perspective and the theological implications of Stephen's martyrdom within Christian doctrine. Overall, a thoughtful and well-written response."
