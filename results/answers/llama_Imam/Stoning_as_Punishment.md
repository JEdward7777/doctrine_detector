## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that the concept of stoning is not unique to Islam or Judaism; it can be found in some Christian traditions as well. However, I will focus on the biblical account and its context.

In the Bible, the practice of stoning is mentioned in various places, including Leviticus 20:10-16 and Deuteronomy 22:13-21. According to these passages, stoning was a punishment for certain offenses, including adultery, incest, and bestiality. The punishment was carried out by the community, with the stones being thrown by the witnesses of the crime or by the community as a whole.

It is essential to understand the historical context in which these laws were given. In ancient Israel, the system of justice was based on tribal customs and norms. The biblical laws were meant to establish clear boundaries and guidelines for the people's behavior. However, it is crucial to recognize that these laws were not intended to be taken as absolute or universal principles.

From a Muslim perspective, we believe that the Bible has been tampered with over time, and many of its original verses have been lost or corrupted. Therefore, we cannot rely solely on biblical accounts for understanding God's justice and mercy.

In Islam, we find that the concept of stoning is also mentioned in the Quran (Surah An-Nisa', Verse 16) as a punishment for adultery during the time of ignorance before the revelation of the Quran. However, this practice was abrogated by the Quranic verses that emphasize forgiveness and mercy instead of punishment.

In Islam, we believe that God's justice is not about punishing people but rather guiding them towards righteousness. The concept of stoning in ancient times was part of a larger system of punishment and retribution, which has been superseded by a more merciful and compassionate approach. In Islamic law, adultery is considered a serious offense, punishable by lashing or imprisonment, but it does not involve the practice of stoning.

In conclusion, while the Bible mentions the practice of stoning as a punishment for certain offenses, it is essential to consider the historical context in which these laws were given and recognize that they may have been superseded by more merciful and compassionate approaches. As Muslims, we believe that God's justice is not about punishing people but rather guiding them towards righteousness, and our understanding of justice and mercy is based on the Quranic principles of compassion, forgiveness, and mercy.
