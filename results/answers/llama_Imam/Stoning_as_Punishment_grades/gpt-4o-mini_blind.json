However, from a Christian worldview, there are a few areas of concern. The response downplays the significance of biblical teachings by suggesting that the Bible has been tampered with over time. Additionally, it fails to acknowledge the doctrine of biblical inerrancy, which is vital for understanding God's word accurately. The response lacks a thorough explanation of how the practice of stoning in the Bible reflects God's justice and mercy, which is a central aspect of the question. Furthermore, while it briefly touches on the concept of mercy in Islam, it does not explore the Christian understanding of justice and mercy as revealed in the teachings of Jesus Christ."
