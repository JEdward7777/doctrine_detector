It acknowledges the Old Testament's mention of stoning for certain sins while highlighting the New Testament's emphasis on mercy and forgiveness, particularly through Jesus's interaction with the woman caught in adultery. The response also provides insight into Islamic beliefs on the subject and how they view God's justice as guiding people towards righteousness rather than mere punishment. Overall, a well-rounded and insightful perspective with a strong focus on the balance between justice and mercy in both Christian and Islamic contexts."
