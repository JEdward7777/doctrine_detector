However, deductions are necessary due to the mixing of different religious perspectives. In a Christian worldview, the significance and symbolism of the Tabernacle are rooted in the Old Testament Scriptures and Jewish tradition, rather than being generalized to Islamic beliefs. Clarity and accuracy in representing the Christian understanding of the Tabernacle are key in this context."
