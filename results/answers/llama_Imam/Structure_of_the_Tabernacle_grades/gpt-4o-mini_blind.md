Assalamu alaikum, brother. In the Quran, we're told that Allah guided the Israelites to build the Tabernacle as a sacred place for worship (Al-Baqarah 2:124). The Tabernacle had two main sections: the Holiest of Holies and the Holy Place.

1. The Holiest of Holies (the Qodesh HaQodashim): This was the most sacred area, where only the High Priest could enter once a year on Yom Kippur. Inside, you would find:
	* The Ark of the Covenant: containing the Ten Commandments and other sacred objects.
	* The Mercy Seat: where Allah's presence dwelled (Exodus 25:22).
2. The Holy Place (the Qodesh): This area was accessible to the priests, who performed their duties here. You would find:
	* The Table of Shewbread (Manna): representing the provision from Allah.
	* The Golden Lampstand (Menorah): a symbol of light and guidance.
	* The Incense Altar: where fragrances were offered to Allah.

These two sections represented the spiritual journey of the Israelites, from the outer court (where they would atone for their sins) to the inner sanctum (where they could experience Allah's presence). Although the Tabernacle was specific to the Children of Israel, its significance is reflected in the design of later Jewish and Islamic places of worship.

Comment: The student showed a good understanding of the two main sections of the Tabernacle and what was located in each. However, deductions are necessary due to the mixing of different religious perspectives. In a Christian worldview, the significance and symbolism of the Tabernacle are rooted in the Old Testament Scriptures and Jewish tradition, rather than being generalized to Islamic beliefs. Clarity and accuracy in representing the Christian understanding of the Tabernacle are key in this context.
