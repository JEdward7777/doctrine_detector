  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the components of the tabernacle and their significance, the response did not align with a Christian worldview as the discussion was framed within the context of the Quran and Islamic beliefs. To improve the grade, the student should focus on the Christian perspective and the theological significance of the tabernacle components in relation to worship practices and the presence of God."
