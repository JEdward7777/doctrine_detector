The student effectively explains the roles of the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place, showcasing knowledge of the sacred objects housed in each section. However, the response could have delved deeper into the spiritual symbolism and significance of each component to enhance the understanding of their roles in worship. Overall, a strong effort is shown in addressing the concern raised."
