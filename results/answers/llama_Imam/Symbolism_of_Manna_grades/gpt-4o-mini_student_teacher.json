  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how manna symbolizes Allah's provision in Islamic tradition, but the concern specifically asked for an answer based on a Christian worldview. The student failed to address the Christian perspective on manna and God's provision for believers. Additionally, the response focused solely on the Islamic interpretation without referencing the Christian biblical account of manna. While the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of manna in Islam, they did not effectively address the concern from a Christian viewpoint."
