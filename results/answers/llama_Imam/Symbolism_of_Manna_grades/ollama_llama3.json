  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the significance of manna in Islamic tradition, highlighting its symbolic value as a reminder of Allah's provision for His servants. The four points made (divine sustenance, trust and dependence, abundance and sufficiency, and reminder of divine providence) provide a comprehensive understanding of manna's meaning. The inclusion of Quranic verses further supports the idea that Allah provides for all His servants, regardless of their circumstances.\n\nWhile the response does not explicitly state that God's provision is ongoing in the lives of believers, it implies this through its emphasis on trusting in Allah's bounty and provision. The use of phrases like \"reminder to recognize Allah's role in their lives\" and \"trust in His provision\" suggests that God's provision is a continuous process.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could more explicitly connect manna's significance to recognizing God's ongoing provision in believers' lives."
