While the explanation is clear and respectful, the response falls short in addressing the specific relationship between Jesus and His followers within the Christian context. In a Christian worldview, the cornerstone metaphor symbolizes Jesus Christ as the foundation and central figure of the Church, emphasizing His significance and role in the lives of believers. The answer could have benefited from a deeper exploration of this aspect while still maintaining the comparative approach with Islam."
