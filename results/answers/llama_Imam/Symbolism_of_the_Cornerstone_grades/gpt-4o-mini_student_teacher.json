However, the response could have been strengthened by delving deeper into how understanding this relationship can specifically help believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example, as mentioned in the concern. Additionally, while the student respectfully presented their Islamic beliefs, more emphasis on the application of the relationship between Jesus and His followers in aligning lives with His teachings from a Christian worldview perspective would have further enhanced the answer."
