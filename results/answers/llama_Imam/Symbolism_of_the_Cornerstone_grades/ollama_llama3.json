  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explores the Cornerstone metaphor, providing biblical context and theological insights from both Christian and Islamic perspectives. It correctly identifies Jesus as the source of strength for believers and the reference point for their lives and faith, aligning with the given answer. Additionally, it highlights the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and the connection He provides between His followers.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly addressed how this understanding can help believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example, as specified in the concern. While the response touches on this topic briefly, it could have been further developed with specific examples or implications for Christian living."
