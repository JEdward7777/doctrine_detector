However, from a Christian worldview, while the analysis is insightful, the fundamental difference in beliefs about the divinity of Jesus as presented in the Bible is not fully addressed. It is important to acknowledge and grapple with this theological distinction in order to fully align with Christ's teachings and example as the reference point for believers."
