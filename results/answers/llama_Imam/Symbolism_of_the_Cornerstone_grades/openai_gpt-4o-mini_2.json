It demonstrates a respectful understanding of the concept within Christian theology, while also highlighting differences in the Islamic perspective on Jesus. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing how understanding the relationship with Jesus as the Cornerstone can help believers align their lives with His teachings and example."
