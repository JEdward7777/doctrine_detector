  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of using a lamb for sacrifices in both the Old and New Testaments, along with the concept of atonement in Christianity. However, the student's perspective as a Muslim Imam led to a comparison between Islam and Christianity, which is not directly relevant to the question posed, as the concern was specifically focused on delving deeper into Christian symbolism and beliefs. While the student showed knowledge of the topic, the answer could be improved by staying more aligned with the specified concern from a Christian worldview."
