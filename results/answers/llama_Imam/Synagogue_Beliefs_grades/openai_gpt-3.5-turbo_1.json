The inclusion of parallels with Islamic principles and institutions adds depth to the comparison. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it would be beneficial to highlight the unique aspects of Christian worship gatherings and how they reflect the community's faith and relationship with God. Additionally, emphasizing the spiritual significance and purpose of communal worship in drawing believers closer to God and edifying one another would enhance the response."
