## [Answer](../Synagogue_Purpose.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum, my brother or sister in faith. As an Islamic scholar, I must emphasize that our understanding of Jewish practices is based on historical records and scriptural references, rather than direct experience.

In ancient times, synagogues played a significant role in the worship practices of Jews. Synagogues were community centers where Jews gathered for prayer, study, and social activities. They were typically constructed in a square shape with a central area for worship and seating areas for men and women to sit separately.

The primary function of synagogues was to serve as a gathering place for communal prayer, known as "minyan." A minyan required at least ten Jewish adults to participate in the service. Synagogues also housed sacred texts, such as Torah scrolls, which were used during services and studied by rabbis and scholars.

In addition to worship, synagogues served as community centers where Jews could socialize, learn, and engage in charitable activities. They often had adjacent facilities for education, charity, and other communal needs.

It is worth noting that the concept of a synagogue was not as prominent during ancient times as it became later on. The Talmud, which was compiled around 500 CE, references synagogues but does not provide detailed information about their structure or functions. The modern synagogue as we know it today emerged in the Middle Ages.

In summary, synagogues played a vital role in ancient Jewish worship practices by providing a space for communal prayer, study, and social activities.
