However, there is a notable deviation from a Christian worldview by introducing Islamic theology and emphasizing the Quran and Prophet Muhammad's significance in relation to Jerusalem. While acknowledging and respecting different religious perspectives is important, the focus should have remained on discussing the role of the temple within the context of Old Testament worship from a Christian worldview."
