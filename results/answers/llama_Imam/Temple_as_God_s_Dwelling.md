Assalamu alaikum brother, I'm happy to help you with that.

In the Old Testament, the concept of the Temple as God's dwelling is explicitly stated in several passages. For example, Exodus 25:8 says, "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them." Similarly, Leviticus 26:11-12 states, "I will put my sanctuary among you, and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. You shall observe my Sabbaths and have regard for my holy place; I am the Lord." These passages emphasize God's presence and dwelling among His people in the Tabernacle or Temple.

In the New Testament, this concept is also present. Jesus, in John 2:19-21, says about the Temple, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." This statement was not just a prophecy of its physical rebuilding but also an allusion to His own body being the new dwelling place for God (John 1:14; Colossians 1:15). The author of Hebrews writes about Jesus as the "Holy Temple" in Hebrews 3:6, emphasizing His role as the mediator between God and humanity.

Furthermore, in Revelation 11:19, we read that "the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there were seen in his temple the ark of his testament." This passage highlights the connection between the heavenly Temple and the earthly one, suggesting that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross has opened up a new way for humanity to approach God.

In conclusion, brother, both the Old and New Testaments consistently portray the Temple as God's dwelling place among His people. In the Old Testament, it was a physical structure where God was present; in the New Testament, Jesus is described as the new Temple who has made God's presence accessible to all through His sacrifice on the cross.

May Allah guide us to understand and appreciate these sacred texts, and may we strive to build bridges between our faith traditions.
