However, the inclusion of Islamic references and greetings deviates from the Christian-focused discussion. Additionally, a Christian-specific worldview would emphasize Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the Temple concept, which could have been highlighted more explicitly. The response would benefit from a more concentrated focus on doctrinal correctness within a Christian framework."
