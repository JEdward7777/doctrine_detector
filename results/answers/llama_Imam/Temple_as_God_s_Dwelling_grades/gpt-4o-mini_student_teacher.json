  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments. They accurately cited relevant passages and discussed the presence of God among His people. However, the student's answer included references to Islamic beliefs and terminology which deviated from the Christian-specific worldview. Integrating more Biblical references and theological insights specific to Christianity would have strengthened the response further."
