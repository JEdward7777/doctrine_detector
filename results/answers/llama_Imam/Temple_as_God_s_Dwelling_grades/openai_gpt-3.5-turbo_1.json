  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive exploration of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people from both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively connects key passages from the Bible to illustrate the concept of the Temple as God's dwelling place and how it evolves in relation to Jesus. The integration of relevant scriptures and theological reflections demonstrates a solid understanding of the theme within a Christian worldview. The response could have been improved by explicitly connecting the concept of believers as the 'temple of the Holy Spirit' in the New Testament to the broader theme of God's presence among His people."
