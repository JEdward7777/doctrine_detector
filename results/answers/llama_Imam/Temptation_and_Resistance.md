## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must emphasize that the Quranic account of Jesus (peace be upon him) is different from the Christian Bible's account. However, we can draw some insights from both sources.

In the Quran, there is no explicit mention of Jesus being tempted by Satan or engaging in any sort of spiritual struggle. Instead, the Quran focuses on Jesus' prophethood and his miraculous birth, as well as his teachings and miracles.

However, based on the Gospels and other Christian sources, I can provide some general observations about Jesus' response to temptation.

According to Matthew 4:1-11, Mark 1:12-13, Luke 4:1-13, and John 10:30, Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness after his baptism. The temptations were:

1. To turn stones into bread (Matthew 4:3-4)
2. To worship Satan in exchange for worldly power (Matthew 4:8-9)
3. To test God's faithfulness by jumping from the pinnacle of the Temple (Matthew 4:5-7)

In response to these temptations, Jesus:

1. Quoted Deuteronomy 8:3 and affirmed that humans live on bread provided by Allah/God alone (Matthew 4:4)
2. Rejected Satan's offer, citing Psalm 16:8 and affirming his allegiance to God/Jesus Christ (Matthew 4:10-11)
3. Jumped from the pinnacle of the Temple, but was caught by angels (Luke 4:9-12)
