  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed comparison of the Quranic and Christian accounts of Jesus, they did not emphasize Jesus' resistance to temptation and the importance of this as a model for Christian believers. The student also did not explicitly highlight Jesus' obedience and commitment to God in the face of temptation, as the reference answer did. However, the student's effort in providing insights from both Islamic and Christian perspectives is commendable."
