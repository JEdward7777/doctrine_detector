It acknowledges the significance of Jesus' response as a model for Christians in their spiritual battles against evil. However, it could strengthen the Christian worldview perspective by emphasizing the theological significance of Jesus' temptation in relation to his identity as the Son of God and the importance of reliance on God's Word in overcoming temptation."
