  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of Jesus' response to temptation in both the Quranic and Christian perspectives. It accurately highlights Jesus' resistance to temptation, showcasing his obedience and commitment to God. The discussion of temptations from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, along with Jesus' responses, aligns well with the concern provided. The integration of both Muslim and Christian perspectives offers a valuable comparison. However, the response would benefit from a stronger emphasis on explaining how Jesus' example can serve as a model for Christians in their own spiritual battles against evil."
