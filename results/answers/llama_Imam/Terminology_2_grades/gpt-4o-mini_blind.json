The answer would have been improved by focusing more on the theological significance of the terms and possibly referencing relevant Biblical passages. Additionally, the response could have benefited from including the belief in the real presence of Christ in the elements for certain Christian denominations. It is important to ensure accuracy in presenting Christian beliefs when discussing theological topics."
