  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the various terms used in Christian communities to refer to the Lord's Supper, their response lacked conciseness and focus on the specific terms asked in the question. Additionally, there was a significant diversion into discussing the differences between Islam and Christianity, which was not directly related to the question at hand. The answer would have been stronger if it had directly addressed and listed the terms 'communion' and 'Last Supper', as per the reference answer provided by the teacher."
