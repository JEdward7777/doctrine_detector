  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student has provided alternative terms within the Islamic tradition that serve roles similar to a deacon in Christianity, the response lacks a clear distinction between the Christian concept of a deacon and the Islamic roles mentioned. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer explanation of the theological significance and specific duties of a deacon in comparison to the suggested Islamic roles. Further elaboration and better delineation of the differences between the two traditions would have strengthened the answer."
