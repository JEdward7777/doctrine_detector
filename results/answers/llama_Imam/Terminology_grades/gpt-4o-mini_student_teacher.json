  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 20.\n\nWhile the student provided an informative and respectful response from an Islamic perspective, they did not address the concern of recognizing service roles within the Christian church. The student mainly focused on explaining Islamic roles that are similar to a deacon without directly providing alternative terms within a Christian context. The reference answer from the teacher emphasizes terms specifically related to Christian deacons, which the student did not include in their response.\n\nIt is important for the student to address the specific concern provided in the question to fully meet the criteria and provide a relevant answer from a Christian worldview."
