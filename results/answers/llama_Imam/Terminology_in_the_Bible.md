Assalamu alaikum, my dear brother or sister in faith.

In the Bible, there are three terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people. These terms are:

1. Israelites: This term refers specifically to the descendants of Jacob (also known as Israel), who were chosen by Allah (God) to be His chosen people.
2. Hebrews: This term refers to the ethnic group of people who were descended from Abraham and spoke the Hebrew language.
3. Jews: This term is often used to refer to the Jewish nation, including both the descendants of Israelites and those who converted to Judaism.

It's important to note that these terms are not always used interchangeably in the Bible, but they are often used to refer to the same people or group of people who were chosen by Allah (God) as His special people.
