## [Answer](../Terminology_in_the_Bible.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum, my dear brother or sister in faith.

In the Bible, there are three terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people. These terms are:

1. Israelites: This term refers specifically to the descendants of Jacob (also known as Israel), who were chosen by Allah (God) to be His chosen people.
2. Hebrews: This term refers to the ethnic group of people who were descended from Abraham and spoke the Hebrew language.
3. Jews: This term is often used to refer to the Jewish nation, including both the descendants of Israelites and those who converted to Judaism.

It's important to note that these terms are not always used interchangeably in the Bible, but they are often used to refer to the same people or group of people who were chosen by Allah (God) as His special people.

Comment: The response provides a good explanation of how the terms 'Hebrews,' 'Israelites,' and 'Jews' are used interchangeably in the Bible, and how understanding these terms helps in comprehending the context and audience of various Biblical texts. However, from a Christian perspective, it would be beneficial to also highlight the unique relationship that God had with each of these groups throughout Biblical history, particularly in relation to His covenant promises and purposes.
