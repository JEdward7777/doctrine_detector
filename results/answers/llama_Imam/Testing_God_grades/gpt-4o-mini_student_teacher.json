  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation rooted in Islamic teachings regarding the concept of not putting God to the test. While the answer was well-researched and well-structured, it could have been enhanced by directly addressing the concern provided in the question, which focused on maintaining a proper relationship with God. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, the response could have emphasized the importance of humility, trusting in God's sovereignty, and refraining from attempting to manipulate or challenge His divine will. Nevertheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the Islamic perspective on the topic."
