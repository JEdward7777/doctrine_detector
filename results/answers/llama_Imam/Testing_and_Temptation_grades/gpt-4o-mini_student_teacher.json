  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the differences between testing and temptation in Islamic and biblical contexts. However, the student focused more on the Islamic perspective and did not fully address the concern of differentiating between testing and temptation for spiritual discernment from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the answer lacked a direct comparison to the reference answer provided by the teacher. A stronger grade could have been achieved by incorporating more direct biblical references and emphasizing the Christian understanding of testing and temptation."
