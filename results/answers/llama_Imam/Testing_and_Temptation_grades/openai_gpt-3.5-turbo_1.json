  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the difference between testing and temptation from an Islamic perspective, highlighting the intentions behind these experiences in Islam and contrasting them with the biblical view. The explanation is well-supported with examples from Islamic and biblical narratives. However, the response could have further integrated the provided Christian-specific answer to enhance the comparison between the two worldviews. Overall, a comprehensive understanding is demonstrated, earning a high grade."
