The Islamic lens utilized by the writer presents a different theological viewpoint and interpretation of the events surrounding Herod Antipas. A Christian worldview emphasizes the divinity of Jesus Christ and the authority of the New Testament Scriptures, which differ significantly from the perspectives presented in Islamic theology. It is important for academic responses to align with the specific worldview being evaluated for accuracy and doctrinal correctness. Further integration of Christian beliefs and scriptural references would enhance the response's appropriateness when addressing a question within a Christian context."
