  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provided information on the significant roles of Herod Antipas in the New Testament, the response lacks the important perspective of understanding the historical and biblical context of Herod Antipas. Additionally, the answer primarily focuses on Islamic perspectives and does not fully engage with the Christian-specific worldview necessary for interpreting the narratives of the New Testament. Consequently, the grade is low as the response misses the critical context needed for a comprehensive understanding of Herod Antipas in the New Testament."
