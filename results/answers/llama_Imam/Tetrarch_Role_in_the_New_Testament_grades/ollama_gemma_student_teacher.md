As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that our primary focus is on the Quranic narrative and the teachings of Islam. However, since you're asking about the New Testament, I'll provide an overview from a Islamic perspective.

In the New Testament, Herod Antipas, also known as "Herod the tetrarch," plays a significant role in the life of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him). Here are some key aspects:

1. The Baptist's Execution: Herod Antipas ordered the execution of John the Baptist (peace be upon him), who was prophesying about the coming Messiah. This event is recorded in Matthew 14:3-12 and Mark 6:17-29.
2. Marriage to Herodias: Herod Antipas married his half-sister, Herodias, after divorcing his first wife, Phasantis (Matthew 14:3). This union led to John the Baptist's execution at her request.
3. The Beheading of John the Baptist: According to Mark 6:21-28, Salome, Herodias' daughter by a previous marriage, danced before Herod Antipas and his courtiers. As a reward, Herodias asked for the head of John the Baptist on a platter.
4. Jesus' Ministry in Galilee: Herod Antipas ruled Galilee during Jesus' ministry (Matthew 2:22; Mark 6:17). Jesus preached in various cities and towns under Herod's jurisdiction.
5. Fear of Jesus: According to Matthew 14:1-2, Herod Antipas was informed about Jesus' miracles and teachings, which led him to fear that Jesus might be John the Baptist raised from the dead.

In Islamic theology, we do not consider the New Testament as a primary source of revelation or authority. Our understanding of the life of Jesus (peace be upon him) comes primarily from the Quranic verses 3:33-36 and 19:16-35.
