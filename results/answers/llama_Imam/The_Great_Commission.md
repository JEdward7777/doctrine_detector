## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
I must clarify that the Christian Bible is not considered a primary source of Islamic knowledge, as Islam does not recognize Jesus (peace be upon him) as the son of God or a divine being. However, I can provide an answer based on available information and mutual understanding.

According to the New Testament, before ascending to heaven, Jesus gave his disciples several commands, including:

1. To love one another (John 13:34-35, 15:12).
2. To remember his teachings and keep them as a commandment (John 14:21-24, 15:20).
3. To spread the good news to all nations (Matthew 28:18-20).

It is important to note that these commands are specific to the Christian faith and may not be directly applicable to Islamic practices or beliefs. As an Imam, I must emphasize the importance of respecting the unique teachings and traditions of each faith community.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
