  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the commands Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven based on the New Testament. The student effectively acknowledges the differences between Christianity and Islam while respecting both faiths. The grade could be higher if the response had included a more explicit statement on the specific command Jesus gave before ascending, which could have been sourced directly from the Bible (Matthew 28:18-20)."
