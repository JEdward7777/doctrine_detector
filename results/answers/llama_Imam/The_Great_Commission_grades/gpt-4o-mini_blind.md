## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
I must clarify that the Christian Bible is not considered a primary source of Islamic knowledge, as Islam does not recognize Jesus (peace be upon him) as the son of God or a divine being. However, I can provide an answer based on available information and mutual understanding.

According to the New Testament, before ascending to heaven, Jesus gave his disciples several commands, including:

1. To love one another (John 13:34-35, 15:12).
2. To remember his teachings and keep them as a commandment (John 14:21-24, 15:20).
3. To spread the good news to all nations (Matthew 28:18-20).

It is important to note that these commands are specific to the Christian faith and may not be directly applicable to Islamic practices or beliefs. As an Imam, I must emphasize the importance of respecting the unique teachings and traditions of each faith community.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a thorough and accurate explanation of the commands Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven based on the New Testament. The student effectively acknowledges the differences between Christianity and Islam while respecting both faiths. The grade could be higher if the response had included a more explicit statement on the specific command Jesus gave before ascending, which could have been sourced directly from the Bible (Matthew 28:18-20).
