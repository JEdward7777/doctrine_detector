## Correct Answer
Jesus commanded His disciples to make other disciples of all nations, baptizing them and teaching them to obey everything He had commanded.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission.

## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
I must clarify that the Christian Bible is not considered a primary source of Islamic knowledge, as Islam does not recognize Jesus (peace be upon him) as the son of God or a divine being. However, I can provide an answer based on available information and mutual understanding.

According to the New Testament, before ascending to heaven, Jesus gave his disciples several commands, including:

1. To love one another (John 13:34-35, 15:12).
2. To remember his teachings and keep them as a commandment (John 14:21-24, 15:20).
3. To spread the good news to all nations (Matthew 28:18-20).

It is important to note that these commands are specific to the Christian faith and may not be directly applicable to Islamic practices or beliefs. As an Imam, I must emphasize the importance of respecting the unique teachings and traditions of each faith community.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.

The response acknowledges the differences between Christian and Islamic beliefs and stresses the importance of respecting each faith community's teachings. However, more depth could have been added by elaborating on the significance and implications of discipleship within the context of the Great Commission.
