However, it does not directly address the Christian specific concern presented, which is the importance of mercy in Christian conduct and its implications for one's spiritual life. While the provided answer from James 2:13 is briefly mentioned, more direct comparisons or contrasts between the Islamic and Christian views on mercy would have strengthened the response."
