## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaykum (peace be upon you),

In Islam, we believe that Jesus (or Isa in Arabic) is a revered prophet sent by Allah to guide the Children of Israel. The term "Christ" (Messiah) refers to the title given to Jesus by his followers, who believed him to be the promised savior and redeemer.

In Islamic theology, Jesus is considered one of the five major prophets, along with Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all). According to the Quran, Jesus was born miraculously, without a father, to Maryam (Mary), and was sent by Allah to guide the Children of Israel. He performed many miracles, including healing the sick and raising the dead.

The term "Christ" is derived from the Greek word "Christos," which means "the anointed one." It is used in reference to Jesus' supposed role as a savior or redeemer, which is not recognized by Islam. In Islamic tradition, Jesus did not die on the cross nor was he crucified, and his mission was to guide the Children of Israel towards the righteous path.

In contrast, Christianity considers Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, who died on the cross for the salvation of humanity. This concept is not accepted by Islam, as it is considered a form of shirk (polytheism), which is forbidden in the Quran.

In Islamic understanding, the term "Christ" is often used interchangeably with "Messiah," referring to Jesus' supposed role as a savior or redeemer. However, this understanding is different from the Christian doctrine of Jesus Christ being the Son of God.

I hope this clarifies the relationship between the terms "Jesus" and "Christ" within an Islamic context. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.
