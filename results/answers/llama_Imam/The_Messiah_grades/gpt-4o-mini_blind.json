However, there are a few doctrinal inaccuracies from a Christian worldview perspective, such as referring to Jesus as a prophet (rather than the Son of God) and denying his crucifixion and role as the savior of humanity. The response could benefit from a more thorough explanation of the Christian understanding of Jesus as the promised Messiah and Son of God."
