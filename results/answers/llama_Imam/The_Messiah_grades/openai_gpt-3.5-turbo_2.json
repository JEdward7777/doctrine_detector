However, it fails to address the concern of clarifying Jesus's identity as the Messiah and its implications from a Christian perspective. It does not acknowledge the Christian belief that Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah who came to save humanity, which is essential in understanding the significance of the term \"Christ\" in Christianity. A more comprehensive comparison between the Islamic and Christian views on Jesus as the Messiah would have been beneficial for addressing the concern effectively."
