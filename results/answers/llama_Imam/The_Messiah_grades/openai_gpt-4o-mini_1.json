Instead, it solely focuses on explaining the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the term \"Christ,\" without providing a Christian interpretation. It misses the opportunity to delve into the significance of Jesus being acknowledged as the Son of God and the Messiah in Christianity. More emphasis on the contrast between the Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus as the Messiah would have been beneficial in addressing the concern."
