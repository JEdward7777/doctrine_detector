## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum,

In the Quran, Allah (SWT) has spoken of a covenant with Bani Israel (the Children of Israel), which is different from the covenant He made with the prophets before them. In this covenant, Allah (SWT) revealed His law and commandments to Prophet Moses (AS), who then wrote them down as the Torah.

In the New Covenant, Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) referred to a new covenant that would replace the old one. In Jeremiah 31:33, it is written, "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws in their mind and write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."

When Jesus (peace be upon him) spoke about a new covenant being written on the hearts of believers, he was referring to the Holy Spirit's role in guiding and directing individuals. This is not meant to be taken literally, as if there is an actual physical writing on the heart.

Rather, it symbolizes a spiritual transformation that takes place within an individual when they accept Jesus (peace be upon him) as their Lord and Savior. The Holy Spirit then begins to write God's laws and principles onto their hearts, guiding them in wisdom and directing them towards righteousness.

In this new covenant, believers are no longer bound by the external observance of laws but are instead motivated by love and a desire to please Allah (SWT). This is reflected in Jesus' teachings about loving one another as He loves us, and doing unto others what we would have them do unto us.

As Muslims, we believe that this new covenant is an extension of the original covenant between Allah (SWT) and His prophets. While it is a unique revelation given to Jesus (peace be upon him), its core principles are in line with Islamic teachings and values.

I hope this explanation clarifies the meaning behind this concept. Please feel free to ask any further questions, Insha'Allah.
