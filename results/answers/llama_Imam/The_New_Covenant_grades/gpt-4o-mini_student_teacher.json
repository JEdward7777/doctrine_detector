  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation comparing the Old Covenant with the New Covenant from an Islamic perspective. However, there was a lack of emphasis on the specific Christian understanding of God writing His law on the hearts of believers in the New Covenant. The student also did not address the concern of transitioning from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant from a Christian worldview. Despite the detailed response, the focus drifted away from the original question and concern."
