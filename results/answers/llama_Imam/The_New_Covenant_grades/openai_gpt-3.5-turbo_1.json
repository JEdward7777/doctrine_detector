  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of how the new covenant in Christianity signifies a transformative internal relationship with God, where His laws are internalized for personal knowledge and motivation to follow His will. It effectively addresses the concern by discussing the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant. The response also shows an understanding of the core principles of the new covenant and how they align with Islamic teachings. The only area for improvement would be to deepen the explanation with more specific references to relevant biblical verses to strengthen the argument further."
