As an Imam, I must clarify that while we Muslims do not believe in the concept of "glorification" as described in the New Testament, we can attempt to understand this notion from a comparative perspective. In the New Testament, being "glorified with Christ" (Philippians 3:21) refers to the believer's future state where they will be transformed into the very likeness of Christ.

In Islamic theology, we do not have a similar concept. However, we do believe in the idea of resurrection and the afterlife. According to Quranic teachings, believers who lead a righteous life will be rewarded with eternal bliss in Paradise, whereas those who reject faith or commit wrongs will face punishment in Hellfire (Quran 3:131-132).

While there are differences between our theological frameworks, we can draw parallels from a philosophical perspective. In the New Testament, being "glorified with Christ" may be seen as a state of spiritual transformation where believers become one with God, free from sin and imperfections.

In Islamic thought, this idea is reflected in the concept of "Barzakh," which describes the intermediate realm between death and the afterlife. Here, the soul or spirit (ruh) of the believer is purified and prepared for eternal life.

It's essential to note that these concepts are distinct and may not be directly comparable. Nonetheless, both traditions share a common goal: to guide believers towards a state of spiritual perfection and union with the Divine.
