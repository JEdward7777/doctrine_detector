It acknowledges the differences in theological frameworks while attempting to draw parallels from a philosophical perspective. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the hope and future promise of glory for believers in both traditions. However, it could have further emphasized the unique Christian belief in sharing in Jesus' eternal glory through transformation and union with God, specifically highlighting this aspect as central to Christian faith and perseverance."
