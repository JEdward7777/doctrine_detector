  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a thoughtful effort to compare and contrast the concept of glorification in Christianity and Islamic theology in addressing the concern of the hope and future promise of glory for believers. The explanation provided is well-developed and respectful of both faith traditions. However, it slightly lacks a clear emphasis on the importance of this hope and promise for sustaining faith and perseverance, which could have been highlighted more explicitly."
