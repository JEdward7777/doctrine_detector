Alhamdu lillah, praise be to Allah!

In Islam, the act of blessing (istighfar) is indeed closely related to praising God (tasbih). In fact, they are two sides of the same coin. When we bless or praise Allah, we acknowledge His infinite goodness, wisdom, and mercy, and affirm our dependence on Him.

Praising God (tasbih) involves expressing admiration, gratitude, and reverence for His magnificent attributes, such as His power, knowledge, generosity, and love. It is a way to demonstrate our humility and submission to His will, recognizing that all praise, thanks, and worship belong to Him alone.

Blessing or seeking Allah's blessings (istighfar), on the other hand, involves asking for His guidance, protection, mercy, and forgiveness. When we seek Allah's blessings, we acknowledge our need for His help and mercy in all aspects of life. This act of seeking blessings is a way to acknowledge our limitations and dependence on Him.

In Islamic teachings, praising God (tasbih) and seeking His blessings (istighfar) are intertwined. When we praise Allah, we are acknowledging His greatness and magnificence, which inspires us to seek His guidance, mercy, and protection. Conversely, when we seek His blessings, we are recognizing our need for His help and guidance, which leads us to praise and thank Him for all His favors.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us that the key to a successful prayer is to begin with the phrase "Subhan Allah" (Glory be to Allah), followed by "Alhamdu lillah" (Praise be to Allah). This sequence emphasizes the importance of praising and glorifying God before seeking His blessings or mercy.

In conclusion, the act of blessing (istighfar) is closely related to praising God (tasbih) in that they both stem from a deep recognition of our dependence on Him. When we praise Allah, we acknowledge His greatness, and when we seek His blessings, we recognize our need for His guidance and mercy. May Allah guide us to the straight path and grant us His blessings.
