However, the response focused more on the similarities between Christianity and Islam rather than deepening the appreciation for the significance of Christ's redemptive work in the New Testament. There was a lack of explicit connection to how the New Testament teachings on cleansing through Jesus's sacrifice relates to sin and redemption. Additionally, the response could have delved further into the unique role of Jesus Christ in providing ultimate cleansing from sin, as emphasized in Christian theology."
