However, the response could further deepen the exploration by explicitly connecting the significance of Christ's redemptive work to the Old Testament practices, as highlighted in the concern provided. Additional engagement with how the Old Testament sacrificial system foreshadowed the ultimate cleansing through Jesus would enhance the overall analysis and integration of Christian worldview elements."
