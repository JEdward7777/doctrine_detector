  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does a good job of discussing the concept of \"cleansing\" in both Christian and Islamic perspectives. The student has successfully incorporated the provided answer about the New Testament's emphasis on Jesus' sacrifice for cleansing from sin. However, the response could have further explored the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings to deepen the appreciation for Christ's redemptive work, as the specified concern indicated. Overall, the student has shown thoughtful engagement with the topic and provided valuable insights from both faith traditions."
