Assalamu alaikum, dear brother.

In the Islamic tradition, we believe that all prophets, including Moses and King David, were chosen by Allah (God) to guide their respective nations. The concept of "chosenness" in Islam is different from the Christian understanding, but it's essential to understand the Islamic perspective on this matter.

In Islam, every prophet was sent to a specific people or nation with a unique message and revelation. Moses, for example, was chosen by Allah to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and receive the Torah (Tawrat). King David, known as Dawud in Arabic, was chosen to be the king of Israel and receive the Psalms (Zabur).

The notion of "chosenness" doesn't imply that these individuals were superior or more pious than others. Rather, it highlights their unique role in conveying Allah's message to their respective peoples. In Islamic theology, every prophet received a specific revelation from Allah, which was tailored to the needs and understanding of their time.

This concept raises important questions about God's selection process:

1. Selection based on need: In Islam, prophets were chosen because they were needed by their people. Moses was sent to lead the Israelites out of slavery, while David was chosen to be a righteous king who would guide his people.
2. Merit-based selection: While prophets are not considered superior or more pious than others, their selection is based on their ability to receive and convey Allah's message effectively. This implies that there is no inherent superiority among human beings; rather, it's the individual's capacity for receiving revelation that determines their role as a prophet.
3. Universality of prophethood: Islam teaches that all prophets were sent by Allah to guide humanity, regardless of their racial or ethnic background. This emphasizes the unity and equality of humanity in Allah's eyes.

In conclusion, the concept of "chosenness" in Islam highlights the unique role of each prophet in conveying Allah's message to their respective peoples. It implies that selection is based on need, merit, and the ability to receive and convey revelation effectively, rather than inherent superiority or piety. This perspective emphasizes the unity and equality of humanity under the guidance of all prophets sent by Allah.
