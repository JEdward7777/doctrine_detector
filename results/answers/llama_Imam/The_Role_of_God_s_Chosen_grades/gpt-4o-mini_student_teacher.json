  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on the chosenness of prophets like Moses and King David, they did not directly address the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders and its implications for the Christian community. Additionally, the student's response focused more on the Islamic beliefs rather than addressing the question from a Christian specific worldview. A stronger connection to the Christian context and a direct response to the given concern would have enhanced the answer."
