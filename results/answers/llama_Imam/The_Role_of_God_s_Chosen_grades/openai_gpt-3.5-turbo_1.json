The response effectively addresses the concern regarding recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders. However, the focus on Islamic teachings may not directly correspond to the Christian worldview, as the response does not explicitly connect the Islamic perspective with its implications for the Christian community. More direct integration of Christian beliefs and teachings would enhance the response further."
