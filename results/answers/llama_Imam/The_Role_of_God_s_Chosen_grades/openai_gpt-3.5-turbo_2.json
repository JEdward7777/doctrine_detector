It appropriately discusses the divine purpose and plans behind God's selection of these leaders. However, there is room for improvement in explicitly connecting this understanding to the Christian community and elaborating on the implications of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders for Christians specifically. Overall, a solid response with a Christian worldview perspective."
