As Muslims, we believe in the prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him), and as such, we respect and acknowledge his role as a messenger of God. Among his disciples, the Twelve Apostles hold a special significance for several reasons.

According to the Gospels, the Twelve Apostles were chosen by Jesus himself, and they played a crucial role in spreading his teachings and message. They were:

1. Simon Peter (later known as Saint Peter)
2. Andrew
3. James (son of Zebedee)
4. John (son of Zebedee)
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew
7. Thomas
8. Matthew
9. James (son of Alphaeus)
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot (who betrayed Jesus)
12. Matthias (chosen to replace Judas)

These apostles were significant for several reasons:

1. Representative of Jesus' message: As chosen by Jesus, they were entrusted with spreading his teachings and message to the world.
2. Witnesses to Jesus' life and ministry: The Twelve Apostles were present throughout Jesus' public ministry, witnessing his miracles, teachings, and interactions with people.
3. Leaders in the early Christian community: After Jesus' death and resurrection, the apostles played a key role in establishing and leading the early Christian church.
4. Symbolic representation of the 12 tribes of Israel: The Twelve Apostles may have also symbolized the reunification of the 12 tribes of Israel, which was seen as a fulfillment of biblical prophecies.

In Islamic tradition, we do not accept the divinity or sonship of Jesus (peace be upon him), but we acknowledge his status as a prophet and messenger of God. The significance of the Twelve Apostles in Christian tradition is also recognized in Islam, as it reflects the importance of Jesus' teachings and message being spread by those closest to him.

In conclusion, the significance of the Twelve Apostles lies in their role as representatives of Jesus' message, witnesses to his life and ministry, leaders in the early Christian community, and symbolic representation of the reunification of the 12 tribes of Israel.
