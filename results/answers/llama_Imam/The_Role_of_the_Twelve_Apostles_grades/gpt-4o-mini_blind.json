However, from a Christian worldview, there are key doctrinal elements missing. The response lacks emphasis on the Apostles' role as foundational figures in establishing the Christian church, their authority to teach and perform miracles in Jesus' name, and the significance of their martyrdoms for the faith. Additionally, the betrayal of Judas Iscariot is not sufficiently contextualized within the larger narrative of Jesus' redemption plan. Overall, while the answer demonstrates respect and acknowledgment of Jesus as a prophet, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of Christian beliefs regarding the Apostles within the context of Jesus' divine mission."
