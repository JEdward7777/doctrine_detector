  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response discussing the significance of the Twelve Apostles in Christian belief and ministry, drawing parallels to Islamic tradition. However, the answer did not clearly acknowledge the core Christian belief that the apostles were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and to continue His teachings after His ascension. Additionally, the response did not emphasize the unique role and significance of the apostles within Christianity."
