  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the significance of the Twelve Apostles from a Christian worldview. They clearly articulate the reasons why the apostles were important to Jesus' ministry and the early Christian Church. However, the response lacks specific references to Christian scriptures or doctrines, which could strengthen the argument."
