  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a detailed explanation of the significance of the Twelve Apostles in Christian tradition, highlighting their roles as representatives of Jesus' message, witnesses to his life and ministry, leaders in the early Christian community, and symbolic representation of the reunification of the 12 tribes of Israel. The writer also acknowledges the importance of Jesus' teachings being spread by those closest to him.\n\nHowever, the response doesn't directly address the concern of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. While it mentions their roles and significance, it could have more explicitly emphasized their importance in carrying on Jesus' message after his ascension.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest adding a sentence or two that directly addresses the concern, such as: \"In addition to their individual roles, the Twelve Apostles played a crucial part in preserving and spreading Jesus' teachings, allowing them to continue to impact believers even after Jesus' physical presence was no longer with them.\" This would help tie the response more closely to the specified concern."
