  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively recognizes the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry by highlighting their role as chosen by Jesus to continue His teachings after His ascension. The discussion on the significance of the Twelve Apostles in spreading Jesus' message and leadership in the early Christian community aligns with the concern provided. The only minor improvement would be to explicitly address the specific significance of all twelve apostles mentioned in the provided list, to further strengthen the understanding of their individual roles in Christian belief and ministry."
