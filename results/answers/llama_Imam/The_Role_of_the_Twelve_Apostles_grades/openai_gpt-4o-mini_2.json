It acknowledges their role as chosen followers of Jesus, tasked with continuing His teachings, and elaborates on their representation, witness, leadership, and symbolic significance within the early Christian community. The response also effectively relates these points to the importance of the apostles in conveying Jesus' message. However, the incorporation of Islamic beliefs about Jesus could be seen as diverging from the Christian perspective, which could be a potential point of contention. Overall, a strong understanding and explanation of the significance of the Twelve Apostles in Christian belief and ministry."
