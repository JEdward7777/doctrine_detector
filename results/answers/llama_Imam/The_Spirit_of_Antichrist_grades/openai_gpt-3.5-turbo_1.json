The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and resisting deceptive forces. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the unique salvific role of Jesus Christ in contrast to the antichrists' denial of His divinity. Additionally, the response could have included more explicit references to relevant biblical passages to strengthen its argument."
