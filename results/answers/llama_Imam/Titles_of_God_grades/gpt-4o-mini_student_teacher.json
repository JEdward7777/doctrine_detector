  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that refer to God as 'Almighty', showcasing their understanding of the question. The response also acknowledges the significance of recognizing these titles in enhancing our understanding of God's character. However, the student's answer includes references to the Quran and Islamic beliefs, which deviates from the Christian-specific worldview required for this grading. The grade is slightly reduced to reflect this deviation."
