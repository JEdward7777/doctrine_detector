## [Answer](../Titles_of_God.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam, my brother or sister in Islam. As an Imam, I must clarify that our primary concern is with the Quranic revelations, but since you're asking about the Bible, I'll do my best to provide a response.

In the Bible, there are several titles and descriptions used to refer to God as 'Almighty'. Some of these include:

1. Almighty God ( Genesis 18:25)
2. The All-Powerful One (Psalm 62:11)
3. The Almighty Creator (Isaiah 40:28)
4. El Shaddai, which means "The Almighty" or "God Almighty" (Genesis 17:1-2, Exodus 6:3)
5. Jehovah Sabaoth, which translates to "The Lord of Hosts" or "The Almighty God" (Psalm 89:8, Isaiah 40:10)

These titles and descriptions emphasize God's supreme power, authority, and control over all creation. They also highlight His ability to do as He pleases, including acting in judgment and mercy.

As Muslims, we recognize the concept of Allah's omnipotence and omniscience, which is reflected in these biblical titles. However, our understanding of God's nature and attributes is based primarily on the Quranic revelations, which provide a unique perspective on His character and actions.

May Allah guide us to understand and appreciate the commonalities between our respective scriptures, while also recognizing the distinctives that set each apart.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of titles used in the Bible that refer to God as 'Almighty', showcasing their understanding of the question. The response also acknowledges the significance of recognizing these titles in enhancing our understanding of God's character. However, the student's answer includes references to the Quran and Islamic beliefs, which deviates from the Christian-specific worldview required for this grading. The grade is slightly reduced to reflect this deviation.
