  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the relationship between transgression, sin, and disobedience. While the response effectively elaborates on how these concepts are viewed within Islam and the importance of seeking forgiveness through tawbah, the answer could have been more directly tied to the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student could have strengthened their argument by succinctly connecting the Islamic perspective to the Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of adhering to God's boundaries and seeking repentance through Jesus Christ for forgiveness."
