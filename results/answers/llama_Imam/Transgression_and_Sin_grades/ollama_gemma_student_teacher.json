  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between transgression, sin, and disobedience within the Islamic worldview. The response clearly explains the concept of transgression as any act that violates Allah's commands, and explores the theological perspectives of sin as a departure from righteousness and disobedience as the deliberate disregard of Allah's guidance. Additionally, the inclusion of the concept of tawbah demonstrates an understanding of the possibility of forgiveness and redemption."
