Assalamu alaikum, dear brother or sister.

The Tabernacle was a sacred structure built by the Israelites during their wilderness journey, as commanded by Allah (SWT) in the Torah. It was a place where they could offer sacrifices and worship Him. However, the Tabernacle was not meant to be a permanent structure, but rather a temporary dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant.

According to the Quran and the Torah, the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle because it had fulfilled its purpose. When King David was anointed as the king of Israel, he wanted to build a temple in Jerusalem, but Allah (SWT) instructed him that it was not his role, but rather that of his son Solomon.

Solomon built the Temple of Jerusalem, which became the new place of worship for the Israelites. The Temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar's army in 586 BCE, and later rebuilt during the reign of Cyrus the Great in 538 BCE.

In Islamic perspective, the Tabernacle and the Temple were part of a gradual process towards the revelation of Allah's Word to humanity. The Quran mentions these structures as a test for the Israelites and a means for them to learn about Allah's unity and oneness (Tawhid).

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "The House [Kaaba] was not built until I had been sent, nor was it sanctified until my sanctification." This Hadith emphasizes that Islam is the culmination of all previous revelations, including the Torah and the Gospel.

In summary, the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle because its purpose had been fulfilled, and a new structure, the Temple, was built to replace it. The Quran and the Prophetic tradition remind us that these structures were part of a broader process leading up to the revelation of Islam.

May Allah guide us towards the straight path and grant us understanding of His revelations.
