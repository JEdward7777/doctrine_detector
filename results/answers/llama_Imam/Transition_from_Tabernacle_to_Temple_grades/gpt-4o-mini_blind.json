The response intertwines Islamic teachings and beliefs with Christian history, which can be confusing and misleading. It fails to address the specific reasons from a Christian perspective as to why the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle, such as the establishment of the Temple or the significance of Christ's sacrifice in Christian theology. The answer also mixes different religious texts and teachings in a way that does not align with doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. It is important to focus on the theological differences between Islam and Christianity when discussing religious history."
