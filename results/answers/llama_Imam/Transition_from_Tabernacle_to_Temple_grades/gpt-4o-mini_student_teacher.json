  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer contains a mix of accurate information regarding the Tabernacle and the transition to the Temple in Jerusalem, but it includes Islamic perspectives and references that are not relevant to understanding the transition in worship practices from a Christian worldview. The focus should have been on the Biblical accounts and significance of the transition within Judaism. The student demonstrated some knowledge but strayed off topic with the inclusion of Islamic teachings."
