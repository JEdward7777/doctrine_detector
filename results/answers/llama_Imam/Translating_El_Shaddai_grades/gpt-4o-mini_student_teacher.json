  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides thoughtful insights and considerations for translating \"El Shaddai\" into different languages, the focus on Islamic tradition and naming of Allah detracts from the specific Christian worldview concern of accurately representing God's name. The student's response does not align closely with the reference answer, which emphasizes a more direct and consistent translation approach. The student's discussion on cultural contexts is appreciated but should have been more centered on the accuracy of representing the Christian understanding of God's name in different languages."
