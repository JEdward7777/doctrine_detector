The suggestion to use local Bible translations as a reference point is also reasonable.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:\n\n* While the response acknowledges that Islamic tradition does not recognize the Trinity or the Christian concept of God, it does not explicitly state that the translation should avoid implying recognition of these concepts. This omission reduces the overall score.\n* The response could benefit from more explicit consideration of how the translation might impact the perception of Allah (God) in different cultures and languages.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern for accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages, but falls short in fully addressing the issue."
