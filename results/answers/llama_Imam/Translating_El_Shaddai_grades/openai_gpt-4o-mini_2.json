However, the response does not address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name in different cultures and languages from a Christian worldview perspective. It acknowledges differences in theological beliefs between Christianity and Islam, but does not offer any insight into the importance of accurately representing God's name in different translations to uphold the reverence and authority of God."
