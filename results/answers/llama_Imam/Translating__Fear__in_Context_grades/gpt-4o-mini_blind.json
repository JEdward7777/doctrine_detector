  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the various ways 'fear' in reference to God can be understood in Islamic context, drawing on relevant Quranic examples. The student effectively explains the significance of understanding 'khawf' and its importance in spiritual growth. The connection between fear, reverence, humility, and God-consciousness is well-articulated. However, to enhance the response further, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of 'khawf' and its doctrinal significance within Islamic belief."
