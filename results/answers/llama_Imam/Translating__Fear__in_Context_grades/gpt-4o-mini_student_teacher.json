  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the different ways in which 'fear' can be translated in the context of God within Islamic tradition. They effectively highlighted the importance of understanding these nuances in one's relationship with God. However, there was a lack of direct engagement with the concern provided regarding the potential misinterpretation of 'fear' leading to a distorted view of God. Encouraging the student to further address this concern in their response would have strengthened their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
