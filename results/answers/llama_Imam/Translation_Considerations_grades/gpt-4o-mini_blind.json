  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60 \n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful perspective on the importance of retaining the terms \"Zion\" and \"Daughter\" in translations of Biblical texts from an Islamic viewpoint. However, as a Christian worldview is being utilized in grading, it is important to note some doctrinal inaccuracies in the response. While respecting different faith traditions is commendable, the focus of the answer should have been on the significance of these terms within Christian theology and scripture, rather than primarily discussing their importance from an Islamic perspective. Additionally, the response could have incorporated more scriptural support or references to enhance the theological depth of the explanation."
