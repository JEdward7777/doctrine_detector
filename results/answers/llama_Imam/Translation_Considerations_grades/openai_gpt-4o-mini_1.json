The theological perspective provided aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the preservation of the rich figurative meanings and connection to Biblical heritage and teachings. The response also acknowledges the importance of interfaith dialogue while maintaining sensitivity to differences in connotations between Islamic and Christian traditions. Overall, a well-reasoned and articulate response that upholds the significance of the original text in translations."
