  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments:\nWhile the student provided a detailed exploration of possible interpretations of the concept of \"image of God\" in Islamic theology, the response overlooks the Christian specific worldview as requested in the prompt. The grading should focus on evaluating the response within the context of Christian beliefs, rather than Islamic theology. The student should have discussed translations and significance of the phrase \"image of God\" as applied to humans and Jesus from a Christian perspective. The key doctrines of the Trinity, the incarnation of Jesus as fully God and fully man, and the belief in original sin should have been emphasized. The lack of addressing Christianity's unique interpretations and significance of the phrase significantly weakens the response."
