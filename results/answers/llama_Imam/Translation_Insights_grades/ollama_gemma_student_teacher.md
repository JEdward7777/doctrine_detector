## [Answer](../Translation_Insights.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, the concept of "image of God" is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran or Hadith (the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad). However, we can explore possible interpretations and their significance.

When considering the phrase "image of God" in a human context:

1. Tashbih: This Arabic term means "likeness" or "similarity." It could be translated as "image" or "form" of God. In Islamic theology, humans are considered to have been created in the likeness of God (Tashbih), which signifies their divine nature and potential for moral excellence.
2. Jism: This Arabic word means "body" or "substance." A possible translation could be "form" or "essence" of God. In Islamic thought, humans are believed to possess a physical body (Jism) that is created by Allah (God), and their spiritual essence is considered a reflection of the divine.
3. Khilqah: This Arabic term means "creation" or "making." A possible translation could be "image" or "icon" of God, emphasizing humanity's status as a creation of Allah.

When considering the phrase "image of God" in reference to Jesus (Isa):

1. Tashbih: As mentioned earlier, this term can also imply a likeness or similarity between humans and God. In Islamic theology, Jesus is seen as a human prophet who was chosen by Allah for his prophetic role. The concept of Tashbih could be applied to Jesus' human nature, highlighting his moral excellence and divine inspiration.
2. Nour: This Arabic term means "light" or "guidance." A possible translation could be "image" or "reflection" of God, emphasizing Jesus' role as a guiding light for humanity.

These translations might be significant because they:

* Highlight the concept of Tashbih (likeness) in Islamic theology, which emphasizes human potential and moral excellence.
* Recognize the divine inspiration that guided prophets like Jesus, including his human nature and prophetic role.
* Acknowledge the importance of creation (Khilqah) or making (Jism) as a fundamental aspect of Islamic thought, underscoring humanity's connection to Allah.

Please note that these translations are not necessarily exact equivalents but rather attempts to understand the concept within an Islamic context.
