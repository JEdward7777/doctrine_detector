  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the concept of \"image of God\" in Islamic theology, offering insightful translations and interpretations based on Islamic terms and beliefs. The analysis is detailed and well-organized, demonstrating a clear understanding of the topic. However, the grade is not higher due to the lack of direct engagement with the Christian-specific perspective on the concept of \"image of God\" and Jesus as portrayed in the Bible. While the response effectively addresses the concern of exploring implications of translation in understanding religious teachings, the Christian worldview and teachings could be better incorporated for a higher grade."
