  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed exploration of how Islamic theology interprets the concept of the \"image of God\" in both human and Jesus' contexts, offering various Arabic terms and their potential translations. While the response achieved a solid level of analysis and application within an Islamic framework, it did not fully address the concern raised regarding the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. The response focused primarily on Islamic perspectives rather than engaging with the implications of translation specifically within biblical teachings."
