  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComments: The response provides alternative translations for the phrase \"to be zealous\" that capture the essence of being passionately committed to God's will. However, there are doctrinal inaccuracies present, such as referring to Allah instead of the God of the Bible and mixing Islamic and Christian terminology. Additionally, the response could benefit from more direct references to specific biblical passages that illustrate the meaning of zeal as described in the question. Encouragement to focus on accurately presenting Christian teachings in future responses."
