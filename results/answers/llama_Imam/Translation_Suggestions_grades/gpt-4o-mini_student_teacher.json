  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided alternative translations that reflect the biblical meaning of \"to be zealous\" well, emphasizing commitment and passion for God's will. However, the student's response incorporated religious references and language from a different faith tradition (Islamic), which can be confusing or inappropriate in a Christian-specific context. It is important to ensure consistency in worldview and religious references when discussing Christian concepts."
