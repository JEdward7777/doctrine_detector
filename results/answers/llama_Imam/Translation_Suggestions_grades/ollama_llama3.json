  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe LLM response provides alternative translations for \"to be zealous\" that reflect the original biblical meaning, which aligns with the concern about understanding the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith. The examples provided from the Bible, such as Phinehas and Ezra, also demonstrate a good grasp of the historical context.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not directly address the original answer or provide a clear connection between the alternative translations and the concern about understanding commitment in the Christian faith. Additionally, while the phrase \"Assalamu alaykum\" is a respectful greeting, it may not be relevant to the discussion at hand.\n\nOverall, the response provides some good insights and examples, but could benefit from more direct addressing of the original answer and concern."
