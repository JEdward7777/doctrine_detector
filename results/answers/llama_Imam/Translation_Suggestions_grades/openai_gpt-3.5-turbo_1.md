Assalamu alaykum, dear brother/sister.

In the Bible, the phrase "to be zealous" (Hebrew: קִנְאַת kina'th) carries a specific meaning that is often misunderstood or misinterpreted in modern times. In its original context, "zeal" referred to a passionate and intense commitment to the Lord's will, akin to a strong sense of devotion and loyalty.

Here are some alternative translations that reflect this biblical meaning:

1. To be ardently devoted: This phrase captures the idea of being deeply committed to God's cause, similar to how a lover might be intensely devoted to their beloved.
2. To have a burning passion: This translation conveys the sense of fervor and enthusiasm that characterized the zealots in the Bible, such as Phinehas (Numbers 25:11) or Ezra (Ezra 10:2).
3. To show great dedication: This phrase emphasizes the idea of setting one's heart and soul towards serving God with unwavering commitment.
4. To be fiercely loyal: In this sense, "zealous" means being deeply committed to upholding the truth, justice, and righteousness, as exemplified by prophets like Jeremiah or Ezekiel.
5. To display intense fervor: This translation highlights the idea of showing great enthusiasm and passion in one's spiritual pursuits, similar to how the Israelites were zealous for their God during times of worship (Psalm 42:2).

Remember, brother/sister, that these alternative translations are meant to capture the original biblical meaning of "to be zealous," which is often misunderstood or misinterpreted in modern times. May Allah guide us to understand and apply the teachings of the Bible in a way that reflects our deep devotion and commitment to Him.
