While these translations align with the Islamic understanding of faithfulness to Allah, they did not directly address the biblical term 'covenant faithfulness.' The student's response could be improved by providing translations that specifically reflect the Christian worldview, such as 'faithful love,' 'loyal, committed love,' and 'loving dependability,' which are more aligned with the biblical understanding of covenant faithfulness."
