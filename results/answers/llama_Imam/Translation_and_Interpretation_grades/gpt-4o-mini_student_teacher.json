  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the term \"Lord\" in the context of Islamic tradition, which is insightful. However, the answer did not specifically address the concern regarding proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impacting the understanding of scripture and the nature of God from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the focus on Islamic terminology and teachings may not align perfectly with a Christian-specific worldview. Further integration of Christian perspectives and a direct tie-in to the concern would have strengthened the answer."
