The student effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms in understanding scripture and the nature of God. The response demonstrates a clear understanding and respect for the sacredness in the relationship between humans and God, aligning well with a Christian worldview that emphasizes reverence for the Lord. Some additional theological reflection connecting the Islamic perspective to Christian beliefs could further enhance the response."
