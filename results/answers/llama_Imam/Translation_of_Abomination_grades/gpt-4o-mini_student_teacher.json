  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: While the student provided a thoughtful analysis of the concept of \"abomination\" within an Islamic framework and utilized Quranic terms to convey similar meanings, the response largely missed the mark in addressing the concern regarding accurate translation in understanding biblical texts. The student focused more on Islamic perspectives and terminology rather than directly addressing the specific translation of \"abomination\" in a biblical context. The answer lacked depth and accuracy in addressing the severity and implications of actions against God's laws in the Christian worldview."
