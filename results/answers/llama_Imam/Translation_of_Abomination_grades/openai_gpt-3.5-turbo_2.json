The inclusion of Quranic terms and the emphasis on conveying the intended meaning accurately while respecting the distinctiveness of each tradition reflect a commendable approach. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding the importance of accurate translation in understanding biblical texts and the severity of actions against God's laws. The only improvement would be to provide more specific examples or references to illustrate the interpretation of \"abomination\" within an Islamic context."
