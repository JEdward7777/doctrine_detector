By drawing parallels between the Hebrew term to'evah and Islamic concepts of haram and makrooh, the writer effectively captures the essence of the term. The use of Quranic terms like fahu, khata', and fasaad to convey similar connotations is a sound strategy. The response also appropriately addresses the concern of accurate translation and the importance of understanding the severity of actions against God's laws in both religious traditions."
