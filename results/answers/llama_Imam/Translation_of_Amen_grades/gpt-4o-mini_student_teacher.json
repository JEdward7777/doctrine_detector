  "grade": 25.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 25/100.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of the phrase \"truly I tell you\" as used by Jesus and included information about its Arabic translation, the response failed to address the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation from a Christian-specific worldview. Additionally, the focus on Islamic scholarship and terminology somewhat detracts from the Christian perspective needed for this question. The student also did not directly address the reference answer provided by the teacher. To improve the grade, the student should have centered the response on the Christian understanding of Jesus' words and the significance of accurately translating and interpreting biblical texts within that specific context."
