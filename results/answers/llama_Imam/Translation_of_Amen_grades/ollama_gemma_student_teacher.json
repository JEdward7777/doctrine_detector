  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a thorough analysis of the original Greek texts and their possible translations into Arabic.\n* Offers four possible translations of \"truly\" based on different contexts and interpretations.\n* Acknowledges the importance of accurate translation and interpretation while respecting the Muslim perspective.\n* Concludes with a respectful and inclusive statement acknowledging Jesus' prophethood.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Includes unnecessary information about Islamic scholarship and Muhammad, which is not relevant to the specific question.\n* Could provide more explanation or examples for each proposed translation.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* Focus more directly on the Christian interpretation of the phrase \"truly\" as used by Jesus.\n* Further elaborate on the theological significance of the phrase in Christian tradition.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical text and the importance of accurate translation. However, it could be improved by focusing more specifically on the Christian perspective and providing additional explanations for the proposed translations."
