## [Answer](../Translation_of_Amen.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Praise be upon the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.

In Islamic scholarship, we recognize that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a prophet and a messenger of God, and his words are considered divine revelations. When he says "truly" or similar phrases like "amen I say unto you," it is essential to consider the original Greek texts and the possible translations into Arabic.

In Matthew 5:22, Mark 3:28, and Luke 12:14, Jesus uses the phrase "amēn ho nyn" (ἀμήν ὁ νῦν), which can be translated as "truly I say to you," "verily I say unto you," or simply "I tell you truly." In Arabic, this is rendered as "innama yaqulu" (إنما يقول).

Some possible translations of Jesus' phrase include:

1. Verily: This translation conveys a sense of solemnity and emphasizes the importance of what follows.
2. Truly: This translation highlights the truthfulness and sincerity of Jesus' words.
3. Indeed: This translation stresses that what Jesus says is a factual reality.
4. I assure you: This translation emphasizes Jesus' assurance or guarantee about what he is saying.

It's essential to note that these translations are not mutually exclusive, and the meaning may vary depending on the context in which they appear. As Muslims, we respect and acknowledge Jesus' prophethood and the divine nature of his words, while also recognizing the importance of accurate translation and interpretation.

May Allah guide us towards understanding His messages through the Prophets, including Jesus (peace be upon him).
