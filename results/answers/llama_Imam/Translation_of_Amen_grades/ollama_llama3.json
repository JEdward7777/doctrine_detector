  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation, particularly in the context of Jesus' words being considered divine revelations. The discussion of possible translations of Jesus' phrase \"truly I say to you\" and the recognition that these translations are not mutually exclusive is also well-handled. Additionally, the response acknowledges the importance of considering the original Greek texts and possible Arabic translations.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where improvement could be made. For example, while the response mentions Jesus' prophethood and the divine nature of his words, it could delve deeper into the significance of this for understanding God's message. Furthermore, the response could provide more specific examples or illustrations to support its points about accurate translation and interpretation.\n\nOverall, I would say that this response is well-written and demonstrates a good grasp of the concern, but could benefit from further development and application of the ideas presented."
