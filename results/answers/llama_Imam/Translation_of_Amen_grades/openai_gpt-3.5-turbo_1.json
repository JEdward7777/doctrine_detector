The explanation of possible translations and their implications shows a thoughtful consideration of the nuances involved in conveying the original meaning of Jesus' words. However, from a Christian worldview, it is essential to emphasize the unique divinity of Jesus and the authority of his words as more than just a prophet, which could have been further highlighted in the response."
