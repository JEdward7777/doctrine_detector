  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed analysis of the translation of Jesus' phrases in the Bible into Arabic, showing a strong understanding of the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. The student effectively relates the given answer (\"Yes, I tell you sincerely\" or \"What I am telling you is true\") to the broader discussion on the variations in translation and the significance of Jesus' words as divine revelations. The link to Islamic scholarship and respect for Jesus as a prophet is well-articulated. Overall, a well-informed and thoughtful response, with a Christian worldview concern applied effectively."
