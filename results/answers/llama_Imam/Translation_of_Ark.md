As-salamu alaykum, my dear brother or sister.

The concept of an "ark" appears in various forms throughout the Hebrew Bible and Christian Old Testament. The term's meaning can change depending on the context in which it is used. Let me break down some key examples:

1. Noah's Ark (Genesis 6-9): In this well-known context, the ark refers to a vessel built by Noah under God's instructions to save his family and two of every kind of animal from a worldwide flood.
2. Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 25-31, 35-40; Deuteronomy 10:1-5; Joshua 3:6-17): The Ark of the Covenant is a chest made of acacia wood, overlaid with gold, and topped with a golden lid called the Mercy Seat. It housed the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod that budded, and other sacred items. The ark served as the dwelling place of God among His people.
3. Ark of Testimony (Exodus 16:32-34; Numbers 11:11): This term refers to a container holding manna, the bread that sustained the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings.
4. Spiritual Ark (1 Kings 8:6-9; Psalm 132:7-10): In this context, the ark represents God's presence among His people. The phrase "the Lord will dwell in his ark" emphasizes God's abiding presence.

When translating these terms into Arabic, we find some variations:

* Noah's Ark: The Arabic term (al-ba'ith) is a direct translation of the Hebrew word for "ark."
* Ark of the Covenant: In Arabic, this term is translated as (‘arsh al-mu’affara), with "covenant" being the central concept.
* Ark of Testimony: This term is often translated as (‘arsh al-shahada) in Arabic, emphasizing its role in preserving God's covenant.
* Spiritual Ark: In Arabic, this phrase might be translated as (maqam Allah fi ‘arshihi), meaning "the place where God dwells in His ark."

Keep in mind that these translations can vary depending on the specific context and interpretation. As Muslims, we recognize the significance of these concepts within the broader biblical narrative, acknowledging their importance in the history of revelation.

I hope this clarifies the varying meanings of "ark" within different Biblical contexts. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Alhamdulillah.
