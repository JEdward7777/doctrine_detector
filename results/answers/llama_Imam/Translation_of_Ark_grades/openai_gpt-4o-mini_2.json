The translation of the term into Arabic is also addressed, showing a consideration for linguistic nuances. However, the response does not directly address the concern of ensuring proper interpretation of scripture through accurate translation and understanding of contextual meanings. While the information provided is valuable, the connection to the concern could have been more explicit to enhance the overall coherence of the response."
