It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the spiritual implications of being \"begotten\" for believers within the Islamic framework. However, the response could have further emphasized how the concept of \"begotten\" in Islam contrasts with the Christian understanding of being \"begotten\" in connection with spiritual rebirth in Christ."
