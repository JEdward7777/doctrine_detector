Assalamu alaikum, dear brother or sister. Thank you for posing this intriguing question.

In Islamic theology, the concept of "begotten" (in Arabic, "walad") is a term used to describe the relationship between Allah (the One and Only God) and His prophets, including Jesus (peace be upon him). In the Quran, Jesus is described as a "word" or a "spirit" that proceeded from Allah's mouth (Quran 4:171).

In Islamic understanding, spiritual rebirth or regeneration (Tawbah) is not about being born again in a physical sense. Rather, it involves a profound inner transformation, where an individual turns away from their old self and its sinful inclinations, and becomes anew in their moral and spiritual character.

Now, when we consider the concept of "begotten" in this context, we must contextualize it within Islamic theology. In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and a messenger of Allah, not a deity or a son of God in the classical Christian sense. Rather, he was chosen by Allah to convey His message to humanity.

In this light, one possible way to understand "begotten" in relation to spiritual rebirth is to see it as an analogy for spiritual creation. Just as Jesus, according to Islamic tradition, was created or brought into being by Allah's word and spirit (Quran 3:45), so too can we, through our faith and devotion, be "begotten" anew in the sense that we are re-created or renewed in our spiritual lives.

This process of spiritual rebirth is not about literal physical birth, but rather a transformation of the inner self. It involves turning away from one's old self and its sinful inclinations, and becoming a new creation in the eyes of Allah (2 Corinthians 5:17).

In this sense, "begotten" can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual regeneration, where an individual is re-born or re-created in their faith and devotion to Allah. This process is rooted in the Islamic concept of Tawbah, which emphasizes the importance of turning away from sin and turning towards Allah.

I hope this helps clarify the concept of "begotten" in relation to spiritual rebirth from an Islamic perspective. May Allah guide us all towards a deeper understanding of His will and a more profound connection with Him.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of "begotten" in Islamic theology and relates it to the idea of spiritual rebirth or regeneration in Islam. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the spiritual implications of being "begotten" for believers within the Islamic framework. However, the response could have further emphasized how the concept of "begotten" in Islam contrasts with the Christian understanding of being "begotten" in connection with spiritual rebirth in Christ.
