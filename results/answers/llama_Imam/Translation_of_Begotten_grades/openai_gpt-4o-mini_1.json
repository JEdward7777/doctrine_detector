The connection between being \"begotten\" in the context of Jesus in Islamic theology and the spiritual regeneration of believers is well explained. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on how the concept of \"begotten\" aligns with Christian beliefs specifically, and more direct references to biblical passages or Christian teachings to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
