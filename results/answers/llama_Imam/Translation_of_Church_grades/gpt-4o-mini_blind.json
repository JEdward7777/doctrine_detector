However, the answer lacked a clear acknowledgment of the distinct theological and doctrinal differences between Islam and Christianity regarding the concept of a church. Additionally, some translations may not fully capture the unique role and significance of a church in Christian belief and practice. Further exploration of these distinctions and a deeper theological analysis would have strengthened the response."
