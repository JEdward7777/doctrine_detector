The focus on sacred spaces and communal worship, while important aspects, does not directly address the concern raised. The suggested translations by the teacher, such as 'gathering together', 'assembly', or 'congregation', better emphasize the inclusivity of the church as a gathering of all believers. Further exploration of translations that specifically convey the idea of inclusivity would have strengthened the response."
