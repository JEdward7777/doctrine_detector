While the suggested translations may not be exact equivalents of the Christian concept of a church, they provide valid analogies and capture the essence of a sacred space for communal worship and devotion from a Muslim perspective. The inclusion of explanations and caveats regarding the theological differences between the two traditions adds nuance and depth to the response."
