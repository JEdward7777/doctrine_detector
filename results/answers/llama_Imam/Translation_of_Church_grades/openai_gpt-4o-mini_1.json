The suggested translations aim to capture the inclusive nature of the church as a space for all believers, which aligns well with the concern of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature in translations. The response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of conveying the essence of the church as a central place for communal worship and fellowship across different religious traditions."
