  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of \"Lord Yahweh\" and its significance in different languages. The suggestions for translating the term into various languages are accurate and respectful of different cultural contexts. \n\nHowever, the reference answer provided by the teacher suggests that additional consideration needs to be given to grammatical structure in the target languages. This aspect is not explicitly addressed in the student's answer. \n\nOverall, this is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological concepts involved."
