  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides some accurate information about the biblical meanings of Hades and Sheol, but fails to directly address the concern of ensuring accurate biblical representation in translations for greater understanding among believers. The student also includes irrelevant information about Islamic beliefs, which does not contribute to answering the question from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student could have provided more specific and concise translation options based on the biblical context."
