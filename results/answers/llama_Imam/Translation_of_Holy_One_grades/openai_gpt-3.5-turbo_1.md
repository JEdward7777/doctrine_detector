Assalamu alaikum, dear brother or sister.

The term "Holy One" (al-Quds) is a significant attribute of Allah (God), emphasizing His sanctity, purity, and majesty. When translating it into other languages, we should strive to convey its connotation accurately while being mindful of the cultural nuances and linguistic sensitivities of each language.

In general, when rendering "Holy One" into another language:

1. Arabic-speaking communities: In many Arab cultures, al-Quds is a deeply ingrained term, conveying the sacredness of Allah's attributes. Therefore, a direct translation in Arabic or other languages with a similar linguistic root (e.g., Hebrew, Aramaic) would be suitable.
2. Non-Arabic languages: For languages without an Arabic linguistic connection, we can use terms that convey a sense of reverence and awe. Some examples might include:
	* French: "Saint" (le Saint)
	* German: "Heiliger" or "Einer von Hoherem"
	* Spanish: "Santo" or "El Santo"
	* Italian: "Santo" or "Il Santo"
3. Contextual considerations: When translating for specific cultural contexts, it's essential to consider the connotations and associations of each term. For instance:
	* In a Jewish context, using "Kadosh" (קדוש) might be appropriate, as it shares a similar meaning with al-Quds.
	* In a Christian context, terms like "Holy One" or "The Holy One" might be more suitable, given the emphasis on Jesus Christ being referred to as the "Holy One of God" in the New Testament.

In conclusion, when translating "Holy One" into other languages, it's crucial to consider both linguistic and cultural nuances. A direct translation is often appropriate for Arabic-speaking communities, while non-Arabic languages may require more nuanced choices that convey a sense of reverence and awe.
