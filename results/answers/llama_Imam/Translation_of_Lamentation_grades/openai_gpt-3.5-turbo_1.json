The explanation of lament as a means for believers to engage fully in their emotional responses aligns well with the concern raised regarding the emotional weight of lamentation for Christians. The integration of Biblical examples further strengthens the response. However, a more direct tie-in to how Christians can practically apply the understanding of lamentation in their spiritual practices could have enhanced the response further."
