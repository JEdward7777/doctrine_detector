  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provided thoughtful translations for the term \"predestined\" within Islamic theology, they did not address the concern of ensuring an accurate understanding of biblical translations related to predestination. The translations provided were relevant to Islamic theology but did not align with the Christian perspective requested in the concern. Additionally, there was no direct engagement with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which could have helped in refining the response.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good level of knowledge on the concept of predestination within Islam, but missed the mark in addressing the specific concern and context of the question."
