  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of considerations when translating the term \"Rabbi\" into different languages, taking into account cultural, linguistic nuances, contextual dependence, conceptual equivalence, and scriptural authenticity. The student demonstrates an understanding of the reverence and devotion associated with the term in the Islamic context. However, the explanation that \"Rabbi\" means \"my Lord\" or \"my God\" is not accurate. In Judaism, \"Rabbi\" refers to a teacher or religious leader, not to God. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to incorporate more specifically Christian perspectives on translation considerations, given the grading perspective provided."
