  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response regarding translating the term \"Rabbi,\" considering cultural nuances, contextual dependence, conceptual equivalence, and scriptural authenticity. However, the answer did not directly address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The response focused more on the general implications and considerations of translating the term \"Rabbi\" rather than specifically addressing how the translation should respect the significance of the title without diminishing Jesus' role as a teacher within Christianity. Therefore, while the answer was informative, it missed the mark on the specific concern provided."
