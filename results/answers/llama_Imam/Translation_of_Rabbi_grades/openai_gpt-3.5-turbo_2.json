  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 60.\n\nWhile the response provides a comprehensive discussion on the considerations for translating the term \"Rabbi\" into different languages in a religious context, it does not directly address the concern regarding accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The response primarily focuses on the Islamic perspective and considerations for translating religious terms, rather than emphasizing the importance of maintaining the unique role of Jesus as a teacher in Christianity. To improve the grade, the response should have included specific points about the significance of Jesus as the ultimate teacher in Christianity and how that should be respected in translation."
