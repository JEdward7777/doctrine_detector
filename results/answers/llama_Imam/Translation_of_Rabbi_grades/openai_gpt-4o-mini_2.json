  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive discussion on the considerations when translating the term \"Rabbi\" into different languages, focusing on cultural nuances, contextual relevance, conceptual equivalence, and scriptural authenticity. It maintains a respectful approach to conveying the depth of reverence and devotion intended in the original Arabic text. However, the response does not specifically address the concern regarding accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. While the discussion on respecting the title's significance is relevant, a direct connection to Jesus' role as a teacher in Christian theology would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
