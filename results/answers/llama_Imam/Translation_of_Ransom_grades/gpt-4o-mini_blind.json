  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the term \"ransom\" in Arabic (fidya) within an Islamic context, highlighting the root meaning and historical background. They also discuss the challenges of translating this term into different languages, considering factors such as context, cultural nuances, and legal implications. While the answer is informative and respectful, it lacks a strong Christian perspective or theological framework. To improve the grade, the student could have included insights from a Christian worldview on the concept of ransom, possibly drawing parallels to the idea of redemption and atonement through Christ."
