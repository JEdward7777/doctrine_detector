  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed explanation of the term \"fidya\" and its implications in Islamic law, along with considerations for translation into different languages. While the student's response is informative and culturally sensitive, it lacks a direct comparison to the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student could improve by focusing on directly addressing the concern of accurately conveying theological terms across linguistic and cultural contexts."
