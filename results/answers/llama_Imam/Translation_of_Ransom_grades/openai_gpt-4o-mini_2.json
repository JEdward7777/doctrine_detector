The concern for ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts is addressed. However, the response could have further emphasized the theological implications of the term \"ransom\" and how it relates to Christian beliefs, as the concern specified a Christian-specific worldview. Additionally, connecting the concept of ransom to Jesus Christ's sacrificial death as a ransom for sin, as understood in Christian theology, would have enhanced the response."
