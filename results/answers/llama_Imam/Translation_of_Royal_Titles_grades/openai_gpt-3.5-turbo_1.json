  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of possible translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and Turkish, which shows a good understanding of cultural nuances. However, the response lacks a direct connection to biblical teachings or a Christian worldview perspective when addressing titles of authority. While the translations provided are accurate and respectful, a more explicit incorporation of biblical teachings on respect for authority figures could have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
