  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides accurate translations of \"Your Majesty\" in different languages commonly used in Islamic contexts, demonstrating a good understanding of linguistic and cultural nuances. The focus on respecting and honoring authority figures aligns well with biblical teachings on honoring those in positions of leadership. However, to improve the grade, the response could have included a more explicit integration of biblical teachings related to honor and respect for authorities."
