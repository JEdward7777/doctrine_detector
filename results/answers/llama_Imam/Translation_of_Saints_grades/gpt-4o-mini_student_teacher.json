  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on revered figures, such as Awliya', which is informative and well-articulated. However, the student did not directly address the concern about using inclusive language and avoiding references to specific religious groups when translating the term 'saints.' The response focused solely on Islamic terminology and practices without offering a recommendation for a recommended way to translate the term while maintaining inclusivity."
