## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I would advise against using the term "saints" when referring to revered figures in Islam. Instead, we use terms like Awliya' (plural of Wali) or Pious Servants of Allah.

In Islamic theology and tradition, Awliya' refers to those individuals who have achieved a high level of spiritual growth and closeness to Allah through their devotion, worship, and good deeds. They are believed to possess a special status in the eyes of Allah, often being referred to as "Friends of Allah" or "Guardians of the Faith."

Using the term "saints" can be problematic because it is rooted in Christian theology and may convey connotations that are not compatible with Islamic teachings. In Islam, we do not have a concept of sainthood or canonization like Christianity does.

Instead, we focus on honoring and commemorating the virtues, deeds, and struggles of our revered figures through various practices such as:

1. Tazkiyah: Purification of the soul, which is often associated with the spiritual growth and development of Awliya'.
2. Dhikr: Remembrance of Allah, which is a central practice in Sufi and other forms of Islamic devotion.
3. Mawlid: Celebrations commemorating the birth or passing of revered figures, often marked by recitation of poetry, music, and other forms of remembrance.
4. Visits to shrines and mausoleums: Many Muslims visit the graves and shrines of Awliya' as a way to seek blessings, guidance, and spiritual nourishment.

In conclusion, I would recommend using terms like Awliya', Wali, or Pious Servants of Allah when referring to revered figures in Islam. This will help maintain clarity and accuracy in our understanding and appreciation of these individuals who have made significant contributions to the Islamic tradition.

* The connection between the student's background as a Muslim Imam and the Christian-specific worldview is not explicitly addressed.

**Areas for improvement:**

* The response could elaborate on how the concept of saints is understood and expressed within Christianity, specifically addressing the concern of inclusivity.
