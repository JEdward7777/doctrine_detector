The student demonstrates a good understanding of the nuances and implications of using different Arabic terms like \"masjid\" and \"haram.\" The advice given on contextualizing, considering connotations, striving for equivalence, and consulting with scholars is sound and practical. To improve, the answer could further emphasize the importance of seeking guidance from authoritative sources like the Quran and Hadith to ensure doctrinal accuracy in translations."
