  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of translating the term \"sanctuary\" in a Muslim context, considering the connotations and implications within Islamic jurisprudence. It offers practical advice on contextualizing, considering connotations, striving for equivalence, and consulting with Islamic scholars. The only improvement could be to directly address the concern of ensuring the accurate translation of Biblical terms, as the response focuses primarily on Islamic terminology."
