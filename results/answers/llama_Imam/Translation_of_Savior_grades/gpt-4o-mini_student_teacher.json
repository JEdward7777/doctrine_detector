  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of \"Savior\" within Islamic theology and provides thorough explanations of the implications of the translation on believers' understanding of God's role. However, the student's response focuses more on the Islamic perspective and lacks a clear comparison to the Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student could include a section discussing how the translation of 'Savior' aligns or differs with the Christian view of Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior who delivers believers from sin and eternal separation from God. This comparison would have enriched the analysis and shown a deeper exploration of how language shapes theological understanding and faith practices across different religious traditions."
