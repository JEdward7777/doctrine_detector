  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-articulated response, considering the implications of translating 'trespass' as 'sin' or 'breaking the rule' within a Christian context. However, the answer primarily focused on the Islamic perspective and did not directly address the concern of spiritual consequences versus moral and relational impact within a church community. It would have been stronger if the response more directly addressed the specified concern and related it back to the given answer from a Christian worldview."
