  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a valuable perspective from an Islamic viewpoint and attempts to bridge the gap between cultures. However, the focus should primarily be on accurately translating the phrase 'house of Yahweh' to convey its meaning and importance in worship spaces. While the student gives insightful information, they slightly deviate from the specific concern of ensuring an accurate translation. The translation suggestions provided by the student, although respectful and informative, do not directly address the concern given."
