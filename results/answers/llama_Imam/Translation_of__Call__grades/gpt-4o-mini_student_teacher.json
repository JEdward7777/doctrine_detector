  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 70.\n\nThe student provided alternative translations that show understanding of the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation. They demonstrated insight into the significance of naming in a biblical context and drew an interesting parallel with Islamic beliefs. However, the response could be improved by focusing more on the specific biblical context and providing deeper analysis of the translations. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic concepts, while insightful, may have veered slightly off topic. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in depth and relevance to the given concern."
