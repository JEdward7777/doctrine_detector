  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of delving into the nuances of biblical language, exploring different translations and meanings of the phrase \"you must call his name.\" The examples provided are relevant and insightful, and the connection to Islamic concepts like tawassul is thoughtful and well-executed. The writer also shows a good understanding of the significance of names in both biblical and Islamic contexts.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response doesn't directly address the concern about understanding the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation. While the examples provided do shed light on the different meanings of the phrase, they could be more explicitly tied to the concern about understanding biblical language.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good grasp of biblical language and its significance in both Christian and Islamic contexts."
