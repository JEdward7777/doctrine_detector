  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of how the translation of \"elect\" has evolved over time in older and modern English Bible versions and offers insightful reflections on the theological implications of these translations. However, the response lacks a distinct Christian worldview perspective in interpreting the concept of being chosen by God. Integrating scriptural references and theological insights specific to Christianity would have strengthened the analysis and provided a more comprehensive Christian perspective."
