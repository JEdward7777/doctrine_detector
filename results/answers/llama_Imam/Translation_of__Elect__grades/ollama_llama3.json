  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the different translations of the word \"elect\" in older and modern Bible versions, and explains how these changes may affect our understanding of God's plan of salvation. The writer also touches on the historical context and theological implications of each translation, which is relevant to the concern about clarifying the meaning of biblical texts.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more directly addressing the concern about being chosen by God. While the response does discuss the concept of election, it could delve deeper into what this means for our understanding of God's relationship with humanity and our identity as his people.\n\nAdditionally, some of the supporting evidence and examples provided in the response are not directly relevant to the concern about clarifying the meaning of biblical texts. For instance, the discussion of Jesus being \"chosen\" or \"appointed\" by God in Matthew 24:22-31 is interesting but not directly related to the concept of election.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the different translations of the word \"elect\", but could be more effective at addressing the specific concern about clarifying the meaning of biblical texts."
