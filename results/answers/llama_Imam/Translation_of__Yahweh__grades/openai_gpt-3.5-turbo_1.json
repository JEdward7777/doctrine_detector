  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the use of the name \"Allah\" and the significance of not using titles or attributes to describe God. It effectively addresses the concern raised about the importance of using the original names of God versus cultural practices. The response could have further emphasized the distinction between Islamic beliefs and practices compared to Christian traditions, but overall it offers a respectful and informative perspective on the issue."
