However, the translations given were specific to Islamic teachings and did not directly address the concern of accurate interpretation of biblical texts within the Christian faith. Additionally, the student could have incorporated more traditional Christian translations and interpretations of the term \"beloved\" to enhance the understanding of interpersonal relationships within the Christian faith."
