## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we believe that Allah (God) has sent prophets to guide humanity throughout history. Distinguishing between a true prophet and a false one is crucial for us to follow the right path. Here are some key characteristics to look out for:

1. Miracles: A true prophet will perform miracles as proof of their prophethood, while a false one may try to deceive with fake miracles.
2. Complying with previous revelations: A true prophet will confirm and build upon earlier revelations, whereas a false one will contradict or ignore them.
3. Moral character: A true prophet will embody the highest moral standards, demonstrating integrity, honesty, compassion, and justice. A false one may exhibit flaws in their behavior.
4. Unity: A true prophet will emphasize unity among people and harmony with nature, while a false one may foster division and discord.
5. Miraculous birth or conception: Many prophets have been born of miraculous means, such as the Virgin Birth of Jesus (peace be upon him) or the miraculous conception of John the Baptist (peace be upon him).
6. Authentic message: A true prophet's message will be consistent with previous revelations and the natural order of the universe, while a false one may promote absurdity or contradiction.
7. Respecting earlier prophets: A true prophet will respect and honor the earlier prophets and their messages, whereas a false one may reject them.

In our tradition, we consider the following additional criteria to determine the authenticity of a prophet:

1. The Prophet's (peace be upon him) biography: We study the life and character of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), as recorded in reliable sources like the Quran and authentic hadiths.
2. Consistency with Islamic teachings: A true prophet will align their message with the fundamental principles and values of Islam, such as Tawhid (Oneness of Allah), justice, compassion, and mercy.
3. Fulfilled prophecies: We look for fulfilled prophecies in the Prophet's life or teachings that confirm his prophethood.

Ultimately, we must rely on our faith and spiritual discernment to distinguish between a true prophet and a false one. It is crucial to seek knowledge from reputable sources and to be cautious of innovations and contradictions with established Islamic teachings.

Remember, as Muslims, we believe that Allah has sent prophets to guide humanity, but it is up to us to recognize and follow their guidance.
