They covered various aspects such as miracles, moral character, unity, message consistency, and additional criteria specific to Islam. However, the focus was more on the signs of a true prophet rather than directly addressing how to distinguish between true and false prophets. The reference answer from the teacher emphasized aligning messages with God's Word, nature of teachings, and fruits of ministry, which could have been directly incorporated into the student's response for a more focused and concise approach."
