  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed comparison between hope in God and mere wishing from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing the importance of faith, trust, and surrender in Allah. While the response effectively highlights the differences between the two concepts and provides insightful explanations, it could have been more focused on directly addressing the Christian-specific view of hope as a confident trust in God's faithfulness and fulfillment of promises. The student's perspective was well-articulated, but a stronger connection to the Christian worldview would have improved the grade."
