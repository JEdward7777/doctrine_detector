  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the difference between hope in God and mere wishing from a Muslim perspective. It effectively distinguishes between hope as a confident expectation rooted in faith and trust in Allah's attributes and promises, as opposed to wishful thinking driven by human desires and uncertainties. The response incorporates relevant Quranic teachings and Prophetic traditions to support the argument. The writer effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the deliberate choice and surrender to Allah's will inherent in genuine hope."
