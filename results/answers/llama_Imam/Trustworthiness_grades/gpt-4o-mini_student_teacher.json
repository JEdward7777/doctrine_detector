  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of trustworthiness according to Islamic principles, which align well with the concern of encouraging followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability.

The student could have further connected their response to Biblical teachings to strengthen their argument."
