  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and thoughtful explanation of trustworthiness from an Islamic perspective, highlighting key principles that align with the concern of living in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability. While the response focuses on Islamic principles, it effectively conveys the importance of honesty, fulfilling commitments, respecting others, and maintaining integrity, which are also values emphasized in the Bible. The only room for improvement would be to more directly reference Biblical teachings on trustworthiness and integrity in addition to Islamic principles."
