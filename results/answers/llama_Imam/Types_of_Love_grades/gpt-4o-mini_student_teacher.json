However, the response does not directly address the concern of how these forms of love align with a biblical worldview. In a Christian-specific context, it is crucial to emphasize that all forms of love, including brotherly love and romantic love, should ultimately reflect the principles of God's love as demonstrated in the Bible. The student's answer could have been improved by incorporating more explicit references to biblical teachings on love and how other forms of love should align with those principles."
