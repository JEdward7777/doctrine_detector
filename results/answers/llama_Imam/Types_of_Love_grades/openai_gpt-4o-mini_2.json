The response could have provided more direct references to biblical teachings on love, such as the characteristics of agape love as described in 1 Corinthians 13, to strengthen the connection between the different types of love and the biblical perspective. More explicit references to how each form of love should reflect the principles of God's love would have enhanced the response."
