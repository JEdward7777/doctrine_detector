Assalamu alaikum, my dear brother/sister in faith,

In the Book of Revelation, some scholars have identified the Antichrist figure as the False Prophet (Al-Masih ad-Dajjal). However, it's essential to note that this identification is not universally accepted among Muslim scholars.

The False Prophet is described in Revelation 13:11-18 and is often seen as a deceiver who will lead many astray. Some have interpreted him as a precursor or a forerunner of the Antichrist (Al-Masih ad-Dajjal) himself, who is also mentioned in the Quran (Al-Kahf 17:95).

The most widely accepted interpretation among Muslims is that Al-Masih ad-Dajjal is actually the Antichrist figure. He is described as a false prophet who will claim to be Allah's Messenger and try to deceive people into believing he is sent by God.

In Islam, the concept of the Antichrist (Al-Masih ad-Dajjal) is closely tied to the End Times and the events surrounding the Day of Judgment. Muslims believe that Al-Masih ad-Dajjal will appear during the End Times, claiming to be a prophet and leading many people astray.

It's essential for us to remember that our understanding of apocalyptic texts like Revelation should be guided by Islamic theology and not influenced by external interpretations or biases. May Allah guide us towards the truth and protect us from false prophets and deceivers.
