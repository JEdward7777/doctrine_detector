While the answer is informative and respectful of Islamic beliefs, it doesn't align with the Christian worldview requested for this task. An answer grounded in Christian theology, which identifies the ultimate Antichrist in Revelation as a figure opposed to Christ and embodying evil, would better satisfy the Christian-specific criteria for this question."
