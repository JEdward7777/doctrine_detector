The connection between the False Prophet and the Antichrist is explained, and the significance of Al-Masih ad-Dajjal in Islamic eschatology is highlighted. However, since the concern was specifically about how understanding eschatological figures can help Christians prepare for challenges in faith, the response does not directly address this aspect within a Christian worldview. It would have been more effective to relate the discussion back to how knowledge of these figures can inform Christian beliefs and actions in light of end times teachings."
