They provide clear examples from scripture to support their claims. However, the inclusion of Islamic theological perspectives and comparisons to Islamic law is beyond the scope of the question and may be confusing to some readers. Overall, this is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical text."
