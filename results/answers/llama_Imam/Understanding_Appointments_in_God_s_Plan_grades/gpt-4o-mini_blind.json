  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While the student attempted to provide an interpretation from a Muslim perspective, the answer deviated significantly from the Christian context of the question. The response lacked doctrinal correctness and did not address the Christian understanding of being \"appointed to eternal life\" as outlined in Scripture. It is important for the student to focus on accurately representing Christian beliefs and theology when responding to questions within a Christian context."
