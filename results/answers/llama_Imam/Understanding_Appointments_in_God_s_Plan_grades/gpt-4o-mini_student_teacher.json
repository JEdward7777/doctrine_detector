  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 40. While the student attempted to provide an answer from a Muslim perspective, the response did not effectively address the Christian concept of being 'appointed to eternal life' in the context of divine selection and grace. The student's explanation focused more on Islamic beliefs regarding individual choice and responsibility, rather than providing a thorough understanding of the Christian perspective. The answer lacked Biblical references and did not capture the essence of God's sovereignty and grace in salvation according to Christian teachings. The student did demonstrate an awareness of the differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs, but the answer did not directly engage with the question from a Christian worldview."
