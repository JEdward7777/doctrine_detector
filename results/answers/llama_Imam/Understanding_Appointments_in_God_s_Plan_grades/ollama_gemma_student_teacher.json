  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the Christian perspective on the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life.\" They accurately explain the biblical references and connect them to the idea of Jesus Christ being predestined for salvation. Additionally, they provide a clear explanation of the Muslim perspective on predestination and election, highlighting the emphasis on individual responsibility and spiritual growth. \n\nHowever, there is room for improvement in areas where the student could have elaborated more on the theological significance of Christ's appointment. Overall, this is a well-written and informative response."
