# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
My brother, I must preface my answer by saying that as an Imam, I am not an expert on Christianity or its theology. However, I will do my best to provide an interpretation from a Muslim perspective.

In the Christian Bible, specifically in John 3:36 and Romans 8:30, it is written that Jesus Christ was "appointed for eternal life" (or "chosen for eternal life"). This phrase can be understood in various ways. From a Christian perspective, being "appointed to eternal life" means that Jesus was predestined by God the Father to be the Savior of humanity.

In other words, it suggests that Jesus' mission and sacrifice were part of God's plan from the beginning. His death on the cross was seen as a necessary step towards reconciling humanity with God, making salvation possible for all who believe in Him. This appointment or predestination is often linked to the concept of "election" in Christian theology, where some believe that only certain individuals are chosen by God for eternal life.

As Muslims, we do not subscribe to the idea of predestination or election as it relates to individual salvation. In Islam, all humans have been created equal and will be judged solely on their actions in this life. The Quran teaches that every person has the capacity to make choices and is responsible for their own destiny (Quran 17:15).

In our faith, we believe that God's plan or "appointment" is simply the natural order of things â€“ creation, life, and then death. It is up to each individual to fulfill their purpose in this life by following the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and submitting to the will of Allah (God). Our ultimate goal is to achieve eternal life, not through predestination, but through our righteous deeds and seeking forgiveness for our mistakes.

In conclusion, while I can provide some insight into Christian theology on this topic, it is essential to note that Muslims do not subscribe to the concept of predestination or election. Instead, we believe in the importance of individual choice and responsibility, as well as the pursuit of spiritual growth and self-improvement throughout our lives.

Comment: 
The response provides a detailed understanding of the concept of divine selection and predestination from a Christian perspective, which is commendable. However, the response lacks a critical evaluation and analysis from a Christian worldview. It focuses more on contrasting Islamic beliefs with Christian beliefs rather than thoroughly examining and evaluating the Christian interpretation provided. In a Christian-specific worldview, the response could have delved deeper into the significance of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation according to Christian theology.
