## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we believe that our faith is based on revelation and the word of Allah (God) as conveyed through His prophets, including Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Our faith is not just about beliefs or opinions, but rather it's a relationship with the Divine.

In this context, believing in something (iman) refers to accepting and submitting to the truth of Allah's existence, unity, and attributes. It involves having conviction and confidence in the Quran as the word of Allah, and in the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him). This type of belief is not just intellectual assent but a deep-seated conviction that guides our actions and decisions.

On the other hand, believing someone (tawakkul) refers to putting one's trust and reliance on another person, whether it's Allah, the prophets, or even human beings. In Islamic teachings, tawakkul is considered a fundamental aspect of faith. It means entrusting one's affairs and well-being to Allah, rather than relying solely on oneself.

To illustrate this difference, consider the following example: when we believe in something (iman), it's like saying, "I accept that the sun will rise tomorrow." This is based on our understanding of the natural world and the laws that govern it. However, when we believe someone (tawakkul), it's like saying, "I trust that Allah will provide for my needs, even if I don't have a clear plan or control over the outcome."

In Islam, believing in someone (tawakkul) is not just about having faith in another person but also about surrendering our will to the Will of Allah. It means acknowledging that Allah has knowledge and power beyond our comprehension, and that He alone is the Creator and Sustainer.

In conclusion, iman (believing in something) is more about accepting a truth or reality, whereas tawakkul (believing someone) is about entrusting one's affairs to Allah, putting one's trust and reliance on Him. As Muslims, we strive for both types of belief, as they are essential components of our faith and spirituality.
