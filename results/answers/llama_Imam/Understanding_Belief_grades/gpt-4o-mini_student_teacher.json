  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and insightful explanation from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing the importance of both iman and tawakkul in faith. The response effectively differentiates between believing in something and believing someone within the context of Islamic teachings. However, the student could have integrated more explicitly Christian-specific references to provide a broader perspective on faith and trust in God and others."
