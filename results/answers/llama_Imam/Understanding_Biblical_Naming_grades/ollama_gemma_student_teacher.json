  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural context of biblical naming practices and provides a thoughtful analysis of the passage. However, the answer is not entirely relevant to the Christian-specific worldview as requested in the prompt. It would have been beneficial for the student to address the concern regarding proper biblical interpretation and the significance of names in scripture from a Christian perspective."
