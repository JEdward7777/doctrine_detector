  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides some insightful information about biblical naming practices, specifically highlighting the cultural context and theological significance of names like John. The explanation of how John's name might be interpreted as \"God has favored\" or \"God's gift\" is also relevant to understanding proper biblical interpretation. Additionally, the Imam's acknowledgement that their primary focus is on Islamic scriptures and practices shows sensitivity towards the concern.\n\nHowever, the response could have been more directly applicable to the concern about understanding proper biblical interpretation by providing more explicit analysis of John 4:20-24 or other scriptural passages that discuss names and their significance. While the response does touch on this topic, it could be further developed.\n\nComment: Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of cultural context and theological significance in biblical naming practices, but could benefit from more direct analysis of scripture to fully address the concern."
