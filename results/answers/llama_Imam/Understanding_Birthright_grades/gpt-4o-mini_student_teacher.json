  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response that clearly illustrates the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob within a Christian context. They accurately highlighted the spiritual consequences for both brothers and tied it back to the importance of prioritizing spiritual values over worldly desires. The student effectively connected the Biblical account to broader implications for individuals and communities. However, the student failed to directly address the concern of the significance of choices and their spiritual consequences explicitly within a Christian worldview, which could have been improved upon for a more focused response."
