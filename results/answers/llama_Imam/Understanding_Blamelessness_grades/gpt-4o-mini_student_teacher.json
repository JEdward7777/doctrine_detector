  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the biblical concept of being blameless and offered insights from a Muslim perspective, acknowledging the differences in terminology and emphasizing the importance of seeking forgiveness and mercy from Allah. While the response was informative and respectful, it did not directly address the Christian understanding of being blameless as obedience to God and honoring Him. The student demonstrated a good understanding of Islamic teachings but could have related them more closely to the Christian concept of blamelessness."
