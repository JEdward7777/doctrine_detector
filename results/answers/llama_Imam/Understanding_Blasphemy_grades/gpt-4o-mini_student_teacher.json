  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of blasphemy from both Christian and Islamic perspectives, which shows a good understanding of the topic. However, the response focused more on similarities between the two religions rather than addressing the concern of the seriousness of blasphemy from a Christian worldview. The student correctly identified biblical references on blasphemy but could have delved deeper into the consequences and implications within Christian belief. Additionally, while the student's response was informative, it lacked a clear connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher, which could have strengthened the Christian perspective."
