  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical perspective on blasphemy and its significance. The response clearly articulates the definition of blasphemy and provides relevant biblical references to support the claim. Additionally, the student acknowledges the importance of approaching the issue with compassion and respect for both Christian and Islamic perspectives.\n\nHowever, minor deductions were made for the following:\n\n- The explanation of blasphemy in the Islamic perspective is not as elaborate as the Christian perspective.\n- The student did not elaborate on the concept of \"speaking in a way that shows deep disrespect\" or provide further examples of blasphemy.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical concept of blasphemy."
