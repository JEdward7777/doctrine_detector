The connection between vows/commitments and spiritual life is addressed well, highlighting the importance of aligning one's actions with pleasing God. However, the response could have delved deeper into the specific significance of vows and commitments in maintaining a healthy spiritual life, rather than focusing mainly on general good deeds and establishing a bond with Allah."
