However, the focus was more on the general concept of establishing a bond with Allah rather than specifically addressing the significance of vows and commitments in maintaining a healthy spiritual life, which was the concern raised. While the response incorporated relevant verses and teachings from Islamic theology, it could have delved deeper into the importance of vows and commitments in the context of spiritual growth and relationship with God."
