  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComments: The student effectively outlines the concept of \"clean\" and \"unclean\" as rooted in Jewish law and provides a comparison to Islamic practices. However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies and missed opportunities for deeper theological reflection. The student correctly touches on separation from sin and holiness but could have delved into the sacrificial aspect of cleanliness in the Old Testament and its fulfillment in Christ in the New Testament. Additionally, the student could have emphasized the role of grace in attaining moral purity through faith in Jesus Christ. More scriptural references and a stronger connection to the overarching narrative of salvation history would have strengthened the answer."
