  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student did a good job in acknowledging the roots of the concepts of \"clean\" and \"unclean\" in the Hebrew Bible and drawing parallels to Islamic practices, there are a few key aspects missing in their response. Firstly, they did not explicitly address the concern provided which focused on the significance of cleanliness in a spiritual context guiding believers in their personal and communal lives. Additionally, the student could have emphasized more on the symbolic nature of cleanliness in relation to moral purity, as indicated in the reference answer.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but failed to fully address the concern and could have delved deeper into the symbolic significance of cleanliness for moral purity."
