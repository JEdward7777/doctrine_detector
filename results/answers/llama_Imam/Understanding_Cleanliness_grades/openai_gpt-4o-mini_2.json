The detailed explanation draws parallels between the biblical concepts of cleanliness and moral purity in Islam, emphasizing the need for believers to strive for spiritual purification. The response addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding the significance of cleanliness can indeed guide believers in their personal and communal lives. However, there could have been a more explicit reference to the redemptive aspects of moral purity through Christ's sacrifice in the Christian worldview."
