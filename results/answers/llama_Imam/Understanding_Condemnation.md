## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must clarify that my primary focus is on Islamic scriptures and teachings. However, I can provide a brief overview of Christian scriptures relevant to your question.

Regarding 1 John 3:20, the verse states, "For if our heart condemn us not, we have confidence before God." Here, the author is emphasizing the importance of having a clean conscience and being free from guilt and shame. Condemnation, in this context, refers to the internal struggle between one's actions and their moral values.

In Romans 5:16, the passage reads, "And not as the offense, so also by the free gift is Godâ€™s grace." This verse highlights the difference between condemnation (based on Adam's sin) and salvation (through Jesus' sacrifice). The author is contrasting the consequences of Adam's disobedience with the liberating power of Christ's redemption.

In both verses, condemnation appears to refer to a state of being guilty or sinful before God. In Islamic theology, this concept aligns with the idea of Allah's justice and accountability for human actions. Muslims believe that every individual will face judgment on the Day of Resurrection, where their deeds will be evaluated, and they will either be rewarded or punished accordingly.

While I'm not a Christian scholar, it seems that the Bible teaches that condemnation is a state of being separated from God due to sin. In contrast, salvation through faith in Jesus Christ provides forgiveness and reconciliation with God.
