  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the biblical passage in question and highlighted the importance of controlling one's speech in both Christianity and Islam. However, the response could have been more focused on the specific concern of understanding the implications of words and their alignment with God's teachings. The student effectively connected the concept of consequences for cursing in Christianity and Islam, which added depth to their response."
