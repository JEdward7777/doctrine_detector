## [Answer](../Understanding_Discipleship.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must clarify that we do not consider Jesus (peace be upon him) as a prophet in the classical sense, but rather as a noble messenger sent by Allah (God). In our understanding, being a disciple of Jesus would mean following his teachings and example, which were centered around obedience to God's will and submission to His guidance.

In the Quran, Jesus is described as one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah, along with others like Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad. The Quranic account of Jesus' life emphasizes his miraculous birth, his message of worshiping One God (Tawhid), and his miracles performed under Allah's authority.

A disciple of Jesus would, therefore, strive to emulate his moral character, which was marked by humility, compassion, and devotion to the One God. They would seek to follow his teachings, such as loving one's neighbors and enemies alike, forgiving those who wrong them, and putting their trust solely in Allah.

In Islamic tradition, we believe that Jesus' message was focused on calling people to worship One God, reject polytheism, and submit to His will. A disciple of Jesus would, therefore, reject idolatry and polytheistic practices, and instead focus on developing a strong sense of awe and reverence for the Almighty.

In conclusion, being a disciple of Jesus according to Islamic understanding means following his teachings and example, which emphasized obedience to God's will, submission to His guidance, and devotion to the One God.

Comment: The response accurately explains the Islamic perspective on being a disciple of Jesus in relation to believing in and obeying his teachings, with a strong emphasis on monotheism and submission to God's will. The explanation of Islamic beliefs and practices in relation to being a disciple of Jesus is thorough and well-reasoned. However, from a Christian worldview, there may be theological differences in understanding Jesus as more than just a noble messenger, but as the Son of God and the Savior.
