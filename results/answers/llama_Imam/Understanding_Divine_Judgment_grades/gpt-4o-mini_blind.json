  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a fairly comprehensive comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on God's judgment. They accurately highlighted key differences in beliefs regarding the nature of judgment, the role of intermediaries, and the criteria for judgment in both faiths. However, there were some minor theological inaccuracies and lack of depth in the explanation of Christian beliefs on judgment. Additionally, while respecting the student's attempt to focus on Islamic perspectives, it is important to provide a more balanced comparison by elaborating further on the Christian understanding of God's judgment."
