However, the response focused more on the differences in beliefs and practices between Islam and Christianity rather than directly addressing the concern of understanding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. The student could have further delved into how God's judgment, as depicted in the Bible, contrasts with the fallibility of human judgment, as well as emphasizing the divine attributes of righteousness and justice as the basis of God's judgment."
