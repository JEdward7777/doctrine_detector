It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. The response demonstrates respect for Christian beliefs while presenting the Islamic viewpoint clearly. Additionally, it references relevant scripture from both faith traditions to support the discussion of judgment."
