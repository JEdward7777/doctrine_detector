## Question [Understanding Divine Judgment](../../../questions/Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md)
What does the Bible say about Godâ€™s judgment and how does it differ from human judgment?

The Bible teaches that God's judgment is based on His perfect righteousness and justice, while human judgment can be flawed and biased. God's judgment is often a response to sin, and it includes both punishment and a call to repentance.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim, I must acknowledge that the Bible is a sacred book for our Christian brothers and sisters, and we respect its significance in their faith. That being said, as an Imam, my primary concern is to provide insight into the Islamic perspective on this topic.

In Islam, we believe that God's judgment is all-encompassing and absolute. The Quran describes it as the Day of Judgment, where every human will be accountable for their actions in this life. This day is mentioned throughout the Quran, emphasizing its importance (e.g., Al-Qiyamah 17-21).

In contrast, the Bible also teaches about God's judgment, but with some differences. In Christian belief, Jesus Christ is considered the ultimate judge, and His judgment will be based on how people respond to the Gospel message (Matthew 25:31-46). The Bible describes a final judgment after the Second Coming of Jesus, where all humanity will be judged according to their deeds (Revelation 20:11-15).

One key difference between Islamic and Christian conceptions of God's judgment is the role of intermediaries. In Islam, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the importance of Allah's mercy and His promise of forgiveness for those who repent and seek forgiveness. While in Christianity, Jesus Christ is considered the intercessor and mediator between humanity and God.

Another significant difference lies in the nature of judgment itself. The Quran emphasizes the accountability of each individual for their actions, while the Bible places more emphasis on the concept of "works" being evaluated by God (Ephesians 2:10). However, both faiths agree that ultimate justice will be served, and those who have lived righteous lives according to their respective standards will be rewarded.

In conclusion, while there are differences between Islamic and Christian conceptions of God's judgment, both faiths acknowledge the importance of accountability before Allah/God. As Muslims, we believe in the mercy and forgiveness of Allah, and that He is just in His judgment.
