It effectively addresses the concern by discussing the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment in both faiths. The inclusion of relevant scripture references adds depth to the analysis. The response could be further strengthened by including more explicit references to how the concept of judgment reflects the character of God in each faith tradition."
