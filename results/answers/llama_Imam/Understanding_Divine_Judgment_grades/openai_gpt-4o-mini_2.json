  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on God's judgment, addressing the concern about understanding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the theological differences between the two faiths in relation to judgment. The response could be improved by delving deeper into the concept of God's perfect judgment and how it relates to His righteousness and justice, providing more specific references from both Islamic and Christian scriptures. Additionally, a clearer conclusion tying back to the initial concern would enhance the overall coherence of the response."
