  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of \"Divine Nature\" within the Islamic tradition. The response clearly articulates the essential attributes of Allah as outlined in Islamic theology, including unity, wisdom, power, mercy, and justice. The inclusion of references to Islamic sources and theological concepts adds depth and authenticity to the explanation. However, the answer would benefit from a closer alignment with the Christian worldview, specifically addressing the relevance of the concept of Divine Nature within that faith tradition."
