# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I'm happy to explain the concept of "Divine Nature" ( Fitrah in Arabic) as it relates to God's characteristics.

In Islam, the term "Fitrah" or "Divine Nature" refers to the inherent and essential nature of Allah (God), which is considered to be perfect, absolute, and unchanging. This divine nature is characterized by attributes that are unique to God alone, such as:

1. Unity (Tawhid): Allah's oneness, singularity, and indivisibility.
2. Wisdom (Hikmah): God's infinite knowledge, intelligence, and omniscience.
3. Power (Quwwah): Allah's omnipotence, ability to do all things, and limitless strength.
4. Mercy (Rahmah): God's compassion, kindness, and forgiveness.
5. Justice (Adl): Allah's fairness, balance, and fairness in all judgments.

These attributes are not only considered essential characteristics of God but also serve as the foundation for understanding God's actions and decrees. The concept of Fitrah emphasizes that these divine attributes are not acquired or developed; rather, they are inherent to Allah's very nature.

In Islamic theology, the idea of Divine Nature is crucial in understanding God's relationship with creation. It underscores the importance of recognizing Allah's sovereignty, wisdom, and justice in all aspects of life. This concept also serves as a guiding principle for Muslims in their daily lives, emphasizing the importance of submitting to Allah's will and living according to His divine guidance.

May Allah guide us to understand and appreciate His magnificent Divine Nature.
