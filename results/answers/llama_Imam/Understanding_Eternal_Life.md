## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Islamic scholar, I must clarify that the Bible is not considered authoritative by Muslims. However, I can provide a general overview of what the Bible teaches on this topic.

According to Christian tradition, the Bible teaches that eternal life is a gift from God that can be inherited through faith in Jesus Christ. The concept of inheriting eternal life is based on passages such as John 3:36, where it says, "Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, and the wrath of God remains on him."

In Christian theology, salvation is seen as a gift from God that can be received through faith in Jesus Christ. This faith is considered the means by which sinners are justified before God and receive the free gift of eternal life (Romans 6:23). The Bible also teaches that this eternal life is not just a future reality but can also be experienced in the present through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ (John 17:3).

In Islamic perspective, we believe that salvation is achieved through submission to Allah and following the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). We do not consider the Bible as an authoritative source for Muslims. However, I must acknowledge that there are many parallels between the message of Islam and Christianity on this topic.

For example, both traditions emphasize the importance of faith and obedience to God's will in achieving eternal life. In Islamic perspective, we believe that one can achieve salvation by following the path of Allah and living a life that is pleasing to Him. This involves performing acts of worship, such as prayer, fasting, and charity, as well as avoiding sinful behaviors.

In conclusion, while there may be differences between the two traditions on this topic, both Christianity and Islam emphasize the importance of faith and obedience to God's will in achieving eternal life.
