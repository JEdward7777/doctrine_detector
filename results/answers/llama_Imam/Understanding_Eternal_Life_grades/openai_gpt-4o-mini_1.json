The response also lacks a clear distinction between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on attaining eternal life, which is important in understanding the uniqueness of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ. More attention to the specific concern and a clearer delineation of theological differences between Christianity and Islam would have strengthened the response."
