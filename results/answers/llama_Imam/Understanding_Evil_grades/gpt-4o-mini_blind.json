  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provides a fair overview of the distinction between \"evil\" and \"wickedness\" in a biblical context, although it lacks depth and specificity. As a Muslim Imam, the student should have refrained from commenting on Christian beliefs and focused solely on the Quranic perspective. The explanation of biblical terms is somewhat accurate but could have been more detailed and grounded in Christian theology. Additionally, the blending of Islamic and Christian teachings towards the end detracts from a clear and focused answer. Overall, there is an attempt to address the question, but the response lacks precision and could benefit from a more thorough analysis of biblical concepts."
