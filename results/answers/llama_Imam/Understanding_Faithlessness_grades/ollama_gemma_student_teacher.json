The response accurately clarifies that the term refers to rejecting the fundamental message of Islam and its prophet, rather than simply having no belief in God. Additionally, the student provides relevant Quranic verses and hadiths to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the relationship between faith and moral conduct, as per the stated concern."
