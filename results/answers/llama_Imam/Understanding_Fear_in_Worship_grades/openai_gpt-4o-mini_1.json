The discussion effectively emphasizes the distinction between a healthy, reverential fear that enhances one's relationship with God and a negative fear that hinders faith. The inclusion of relevant biblical verses and Islamic teachings enriches the analysis and demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter. This response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how a proper understanding of fear can indeed deepen one's relationship with God and enhance worship practices."
