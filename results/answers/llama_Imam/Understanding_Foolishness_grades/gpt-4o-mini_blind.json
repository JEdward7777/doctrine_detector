However, there are theological inaccuracies present, such as equating biblical foolishness solely with ignorance rather than also emphasizing rebellion against God and disobedience to His commands. The attempt to draw parallels between Islamic jahiliyya and biblical foolishness is interesting but could be better developed. Overall, while the effort is made to engage with the topic, the theological nuances could be more accurately and distinctly presented."
