They correctly explained the characteristics of a fool based on biblical references. However, there was a significant focus on Islamic theology and concepts, which detracted from a fully Christian perspective. The answer could have been improved by sticking more closely to the Christian worldview and relating the concept of foolishness solely to biblical teachings."
