  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed overview of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles in the early church and how it affected their relationships. However, the answer lacks a strong Christian-specific worldview and does not directly address the concerns raised in the reference answer. The student's focus on inclusivity and unity in the early church aligns with Christian values, but the response would benefit from a clearer alignment with the specific Christian perspective outlined in the reference answer."
