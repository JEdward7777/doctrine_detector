As-Salamu Alaykum (Peace be upon you),

The Israelites' perception of Gentiles, or non-Jews, played a significant role in shaping their relationships with them in the early Church. In the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, we see that the apostles and early believers struggled with the concept of including Gentiles into the community of faith.

In the early Christian era, Jewish Christians continued to observe many Jewish customs and traditions, including keeping kosher, observing the Sabbath, and practicing circumcision (Acts 11:2-3; Galatians 2:12). This led to a sense of separation between Jewish believers and Gentile converts. The apostles, especially Peter and Paul, were initially hesitant to mix with Gentiles due to their cultural and religious differences.

The Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), however, marked a turning point in this regard. The apostles and elders gathered to discuss the question of circumcision being required for Gentile believers. After much debate and discussion, they concluded that faith in Jesus Christ was sufficient for salvation, regardless of one's ethnicity or background (Acts 15:7-11). This decision opened the door for Gentiles to be incorporated into the early Christian community without requiring them to become Jewish first.

However, this newfound inclusivity was not without its challenges. Some Jewish believers continued to view Gentile converts as inferior and uncircumcised (Ephesians 2:11-12). This led to tensions and conflicts within the early Church, particularly in regards to issues like food laws (1 Corinthians 8:7-13) and cultural practices (Romans 14:5-6).

To address these challenges, the apostles emphasized the importance of unity and equality among believers, regardless of their ethnic or cultural background. Paul, for example, wrote that "there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28).

In conclusion, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles had a significant impact on their relationships with them in the early Church. The initial hesitation to mix with Gentiles gave way to a greater understanding and acceptance, ultimately leading to the inclusion of Gentile believers into the community of faith.

May Allah guide us all towards unity and harmony, as we strive to build bridges between cultures and communities. Ameen (Prayer).
