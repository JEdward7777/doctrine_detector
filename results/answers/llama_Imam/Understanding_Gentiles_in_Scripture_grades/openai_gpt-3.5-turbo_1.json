The discussion on the challenges faced in integrating Gentile believers into the community and the subsequent emphasis on unity and equality is well-explained. The inclusion of relevant verses from the Bible, along with a prayer for unity and harmony, reflects a Christian worldview. However, the response could have emphasized more explicitly on how these developments impacted the church's unity, aligning with the specified concern. Nonetheless, the overall understanding and integration of the provided answer are commendable."
