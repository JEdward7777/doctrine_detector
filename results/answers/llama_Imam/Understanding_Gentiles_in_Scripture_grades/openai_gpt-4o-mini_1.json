  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles in the early Church, drawing on biblical references and historical contexts. It effectively addresses the concern by discussing how these perceptions influenced relationships and unity within the church. The response also incorporates key Christian principles of unity and equality among believers. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the Israelites' traditional view of Gentiles as outsiders to the challenges faced in breaking down barriers within the early church."
