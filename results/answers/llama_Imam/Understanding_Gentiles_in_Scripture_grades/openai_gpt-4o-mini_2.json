  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles and their relationships within the early Church. It accurately discusses the initial challenges and hesitations faced by Jewish Christians in accepting Gentile believers, as well as the eventual shift towards inclusivity. The integration of biblical references and the mention of the Jerusalem Council adds depth to the explanation. However, there is a minor deviation from the original answer in terms of explicitly stating the Israelites' traditional view of Gentiles as outsiders, which slightly detracts from the alignment with the given answer. Nevertheless, the response effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a solid understanding of the historical context and implications for the church's unity from a Christian worldview."
