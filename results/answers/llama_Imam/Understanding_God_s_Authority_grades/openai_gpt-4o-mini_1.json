The connection to believers recognizing and submitting to God's authority is clearly articulated. However, there could be a bit more direct addressing of the concern regarding believers struggling to comprehend the implications of God's sovereignty in their personal lives. More focus on how believers can seek understanding and surrender to God's sovereignty in their daily experiences would enhance the response further."
