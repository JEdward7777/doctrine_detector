  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive perspective on the concept of God's knowledge and guidance in Islam. However, the student deviates from the Christian-specific worldview by focusing more on the general understanding of God's knowledge across faiths rather than addressing the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals within Christianity. The student could improve the grade by linking their explanation more directly to the idea of God calling individuals by name in the Christian context."
