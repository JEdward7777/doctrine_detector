It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the personal connection between God/Allah and individuals and the specific purposes appointed by them. However, the response could have delved deeper into the unique aspect of God calling individuals by name in Christianity and how it relates to the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals in a more focused manner."
