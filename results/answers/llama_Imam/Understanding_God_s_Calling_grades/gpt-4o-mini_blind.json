However, from a Christian worldview, it falls short in accurately capturing the specificity and uniqueness of God's calling as understood in Christian theology. It lacks emphasis on the central role of Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit in the Christian understanding of calling and the importance of personal relationship with God in discerning and fulfilling one's calling. The response could be enhanced by incorporating more doctrinal elements specific to Christian beliefs on being \"called\" by God."
