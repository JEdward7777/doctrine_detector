  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 70. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the Christian concept of being \"called\" by God and made a genuine effort to respect and incorporate their Muslim perspective. The student effectively connected the idea of a divine calling to serving a higher purpose in both faith traditions. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the personal nature of the calling and emphasizing the individual relationship between the believer and God in fulfilling their specific purpose. Additionally, addressing the biblical basis for being \"called\" by God in Christianity would have strengthened their answer from a Christian worldview perspective. Overall, the student showed insight in drawing parallels between the two faith traditions despite some theological differences."
