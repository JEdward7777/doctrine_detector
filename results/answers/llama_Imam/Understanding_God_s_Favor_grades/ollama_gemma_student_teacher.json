  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical accounts of Jesus' favor with God and men. They provide well-chosen examples from the Gospels to support their claims. However, the answer could benefit from a clearer connection to the concern expressed in the prompt, which specifically refers to emulating Jesus' qualities. Overall, this is a well-written and informative response."
