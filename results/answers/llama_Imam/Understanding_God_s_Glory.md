## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must emphasize that the concept of God's glory in the Bible is fundamentally different from worldly sources of glory. In Islam, we also understand God's majesty and grandeur as being beyond human comprehension, but let us explore this concept in the context of the Bible.

In the Bible, God's glory refers to His manifest presence, power, and attributes that reveal His character. It is often described as a radiant light or fire that shines forth from Him (Exodus 16:7, Isaiah 60:1). This glory is not something that can be earned or achieved by human beings; rather, it is a reflection of God's very nature.

In contrast, worldly sources of glory are often based on human achievements, possessions, or status. People may seek to glorify themselves through wealth, power, fame, or material possessions, which is ultimately fleeting and impermanent. The Bible warns against seeking one's own glory, as this can lead to pride, arrogance, and even idolatry (Isaiah 47:8-9).

The Bible also highlights the dangers of comparing ourselves to others in order to gain a sense of self-importance or validation. This is because human beings are inherently flawed and fallible, whereas God's glory is unwavering and unchanging.

In contrast, God's glory is not diminished by human imperfections; rather, it is often revealed through the imperfect vessels that He uses (e.g., Moses, David). The Bible emphasizes that true greatness comes from recognizing God's sovereignty and submitting to His will, rather than seeking to elevate oneself above others or claiming personal merit.

In Islamic terms, we would say that God's glory is transcendent and beyond human comprehension, whereas worldly sources of glory are based on human ego and impermanence. The Quran says, "And if all the trees in the earth were pens, and the seas, with ink, that was written what is written in Allah's book, it would be exhausted." (Quran 31:27)

In conclusion, God's glory in the Bible is a manifestation of His character and nature, whereas worldly sources of glory are based on human achievements or status. The Bible encourages us to seek our worth and identity in God's eyes rather than in external validation or recognition.
