  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful comparison between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory, emphasizing the transcendent and unchanging nature of God's glory. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the concept of God's glory being immeasurably superior in value, worth, and majesty compared to any earthly glory, as specified in the reference answer. The student could have strengthened their answer by explicitly connecting the understanding of God's glory to the importance of proper worship, as outlined in the concern."
