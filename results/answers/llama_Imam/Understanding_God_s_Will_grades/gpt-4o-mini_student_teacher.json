  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-written response about seeking Allah's will in everyday decisions from an Islamic perspective. However, the concern raised was specific to a Christian worldview. While the concepts of seeking guidance and surrendering to a higher power are similar in both Islamic and Christian beliefs, the response did not directly address the concern regarding struggling to make decisions that honor God or feeling uncertain about His direction. The student could have drawn more parallels between seeking God's will in Islam and Christianity to provide a more relevant and specific answer to the concern raised."
