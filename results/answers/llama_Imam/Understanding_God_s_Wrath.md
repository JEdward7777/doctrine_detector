## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must emphasize that my primary focus is on the revelation in the Quran, which is the word of Allah (God) as revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, since you've asked about the Bible, I'll provide an overview of what it says about God's wrath and its relationship to human anger.

In the Bible, God's wrath is often described as a response to humanity's disobedience and rebellion against His will. For example, in Ezekiel 5:13, it says, "As surely as I live, I swear this: Your detestable practices and faithless conduct will no longer be a stain on my sight." Similarly, in Romans 1:18, it states, "The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people."

In Christian theology, God's wrath is often seen as a manifestation of His justice, reflecting His holiness and moral purity. According to this view, God's wrath is not just a reaction to human sin but also a means of achieving justice and purifying humanity.

Now, regarding the difference between God's wrath and human anger, the Bible presents some key distinctions:

1. Motivation: Human anger is often driven by personal interests, emotions, or biases, whereas God's wrath is motivated by His justice and concern for moral purity.
2. Intensity: Human anger can be intense but is ultimately limited by human frailty and imperfection. In contrast, God's wrath is described as a powerful force that can bring about destruction (e.g., 1 Corinthians 10:10).
3. Purpose: Human anger might seek to punish or exact revenge on others, whereas God's wrath seeks to correct humanity's sinful nature and bring about redemption.
4. Impartiality: While human anger can be partial and influenced by personal biases, God's wrath is seen as impartial and just, affecting both the righteous and the wicked (e.g., Ezekiel 18:25).

It's essential to note that these biblical passages should not be taken as a justification for violence or aggression. Rather, they serve as a reminder of God's sovereignty and justice, which are central themes in Christian theology.

As Muslims, we believe in a just and merciful Allah who is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Maliki). While our understanding of God's wrath might differ from that of Christians, we recognize that it is an aspect of His justice and power. In Islam, we believe that Allah's mercy and forgiveness are always available to those who repent and turn to Him.

May Allah guide us all towards a path of righteousness, mercy, and compassion.
