  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough comparison between God's wrath and human anger from a Muslim perspective, they did not fully address the concern specified, which emphasized that God's wrath is a measured response to sin, in contrast to a fit of rage. The student could have provided more specific references from the Bible supporting this idea, aligning their response better with the concern presented. Additionally, the student's answer could benefit from a more focused explanation on the nature of God's wrath specifically, rather than merely discussing the differences between human anger and God's wrath.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and presented a well-structured response, but there was room for improvement in directly addressing the concern provided and delving deeper into the nature of God's wrath in the context of the Bible."
