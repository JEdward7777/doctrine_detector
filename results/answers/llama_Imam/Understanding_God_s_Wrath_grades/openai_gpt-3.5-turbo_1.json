  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the nature of God's wrath as an intense, righteous judgment of sin, contrasting it with human anger. The explanation provided aligns well with the concern raised, emphasizing that God's wrath is not a fit of rage but a measured response to sin. The response effectively integrates Christian theology and presents a thoughtful reflection on the concept of God's wrath within a Muslim Imam's perspective."
