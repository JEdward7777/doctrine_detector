  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid explanation of the Christian concept of \"grace\" from an Islamic perspective. They accurately describe how grace is understood within Christianity and its theological significance. The student effectively contrasts the Christian understanding of grace with Islamic concepts of mercy and forgiveness. However, the student could have further emphasized the doctrinal distinctiveness of grace in Christianity, highlighting the unique role it plays in salvation through Christ. Additionally, while the student acknowledges the differences between Islam and Christianity, a more explicit recognition of the doctrinal divergence on the concept of grace would have strengthened the answer."
