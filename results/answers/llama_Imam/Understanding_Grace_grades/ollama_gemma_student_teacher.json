  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of \"grace\" in a Christian context. They accurately explain it as unmerited favor or blessing from God, highlighting its role in salvation and forgiveness. Additionally, the student provides relevant examples from Christian theology and draws parallels to Islamic concepts of mercy and forgiveness. However, the inclusion of the Islamic perspective adds unnecessary information that is not relevant to the Christian-specific concern of the question."
