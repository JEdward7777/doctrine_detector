It also effectively distinguishes between the two faiths' understandings of grace within their theological frameworks. The response could have strengthened the Christian perspective by emphasizing the significance of Jesus Christ's role in mediating God's grace to humanity, as central to Christian belief. This addition would have further highlighted the Christian understanding of grace as rooted in the person and work of Jesus Christ."
