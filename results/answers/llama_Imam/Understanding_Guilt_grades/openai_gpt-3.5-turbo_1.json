It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding guilt is essential for recognizing the need for repentance and forgiveness in both traditions. The integration of scriptural references adds depth to the analysis. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of repentance and forgiveness as central themes in both Islamic and Christian beliefs to strengthen the connection between guilt and the need for redemption."
