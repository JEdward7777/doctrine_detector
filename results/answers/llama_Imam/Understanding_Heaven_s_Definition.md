## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As a Muslim Imam, I must clarify that the concept of "heaven" in Christianity has some differences with the understanding of paradise (jannah) in Islam. However, since you are asking about the biblical definition, I will provide an overview.

In the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, the term "heaven" (Hebrew: shamayim; Greek: ouranos) refers to the physical sky or atmosphere above the earth. This understanding is consistent with the Hebrew concept of "shamayim," which means "expanse" or "firmament." The Psalmist writes, "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands" (Psalm 19:1).

In this sense, the sky is often referred to as heaven, emphasizing its connection to the divine. For example, when Noah's ark landed on the mountains of Ararat, it was said that "the heavens were opened" (Genesis 8:2). This phrase likely meant that the weather cleared, or the sky became more favorable.

However, in the New Testament, particularly in Christian eschatology, "heaven" takes on a more spiritual connotation. It refers to the dwelling place of God and the blessed afterlife for believers. Jesus spoke of entering the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 5:3), which is often seen as a realm where righteousness reigns supreme.

In this context, heaven is not just the physical sky but a metaphysical realm where one finds eternal life, joy, and reunion with the Creator. This understanding of heaven is closely tied to the concept of paradise or the afterlife in Islamic theology, where believers are rewarded with divine presence and bliss in jannah.

To summarize:

* In the Old Testament, "heaven" often refers to the physical sky or atmosphere.
* In the New Testament, particularly in Christian eschatology, "heaven" takes on a more spiritual connotation, referring to the dwelling place of God and the blessed afterlife for believers.

May Allah guide us all to seek knowledge and wisdom, and may we strive to understand His divine plan for humanity. Ameen.
