  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a generally correct explanation of the biblical understanding of heaven, especially in differentiating between the Old and New Testaments. However, as the question specifically requested a Christian perspective, the inclusion of Islamic theology and prayers in the response was unnecessary and may be confusing in a Christian context. Additionally, there were some inaccuracies in equating 'heaven' with the physical sky in the Old Testament. More emphasis on the Biblical definition of 'heaven' and its spiritual significance in Christianity would have strengthened the response."
