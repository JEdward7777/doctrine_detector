  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective, but the response did not fully address the given concern regarding the biblical definition of 'heaven' and its differentiation from 'sky'. Additionally, the response lacked a clear Christian worldview in discussing the concept of heaven as defined in the Bible. Improving the focus on the specific biblical definitions and incorporating a Christian worldview perspective would strengthen the answer."
