  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed comparison between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding the concept of being an heir to God's promises. However, the answer focused more on the differences between the two religions rather than directly addressing the Christian understanding of receiving God's promises as heirs through faith. Additionally, the response did not fully explore the identity of Christians as heirs of God's promises as specified in the concern. The student did show an understanding of the theological differences but lacked a specific connection to the Christian perspective outlined in the reference answer."
