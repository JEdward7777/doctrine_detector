  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed comparison between Islamic and Christian perspectives on the concept of being heirs of God's promises. It effectively explores the identity of Christians as heirs through faith, as prompted in the concern. The explanation is clear, respectful of both faith traditions, and offers insight into the theological differences surrounding this concept. However, the response could have benefited from a more explicit discussion of how the Christian idea of being heirs connects believers to God's promises in a deeper spiritual sense."
