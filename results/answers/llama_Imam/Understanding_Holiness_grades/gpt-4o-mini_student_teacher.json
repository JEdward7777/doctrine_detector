  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer delves into the concept of God's holiness from an Islamic perspective, referencing Allah and the Quran. While the response provides valuable insights on the implications of God's holiness on our relationship with Him, it does not directly address the Christian worldview or the necessary steps for approaching a holy God as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. The student would benefit from incorporating more specifically Christian references and theological viewpoints."
