## [Answer](../Understanding_Holiness.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Masha'Allah, what a profound question!

In the Quran, Allah is described as "Qudus" (purified) and "Aziz" (exalted), emphasizing His absolute holiness. To understand this concept, let's delve into its implications on our relationship with Him.

Absolute holiness means that Allah is completely free from any imperfection, impurity, or deficiency. He is the source of all goodness, justice, and righteousness. This attribute underscores His infinite distance from anything unclean or imperfect. In other words, there is nothing in Allah that can be considered less than perfect or worthy of criticism.

Now, let's explore how this concept affects our relationship with Him:

1. **Fear of Allah**: When we understand the absolute holiness of Allah, we are reminded to fear and respect His majesty. This fear is not a negative emotion but rather a sense of awe and reverence for His power, wisdom, and justice.
2. **Purity in worship**: Recognizing Allah's absolute holiness demands that our acts of worship be free from any impurities or imperfections. We must strive to purify our intentions, words, and deeds, as we approach Him in prayer and other forms of worship.
3. **Humility and gratitude**: The realization of Allah's absoluteness humbles us, acknowledging His sovereignty over all things. This awareness cultivates a sense of gratitude for His blessings, mercy, and guidance, which inspires us to obey His commands and seek His pleasure.
4. **Conformity to His Will**: As we comprehend the absolute holiness of Allah, we are motivated to conform our lives to His will, seeking to align ourselves with His divine plan. This understanding encourages us to abandon our own desires and preferences in favor of submitting to His wisdom.
5. **Righteousness and moral excellence**: The concept of absolute holiness emphasizes the importance of striving for righteousness and moral excellence. We are called to cultivate virtues like justice, compassion, and fairness, as we seek to reflect Allah's character in our daily lives.

In conclusion, the notion of Allah's absolute holiness underscores His infinite perfection and distance from imperfection. This understanding inspires us to fear Him, purify our worship, cultivate humility and gratitude, conform to His will, and strive for moral excellence. May this realization bring us closer to our Lord and inspire us to live a life that pleases Him.
