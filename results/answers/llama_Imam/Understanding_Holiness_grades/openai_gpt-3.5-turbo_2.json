While the response effectively addresses the concern regarding the necessary steps for approaching a holy God, it is important to note the distinct differences in the Christian understanding of approaching a holy God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the bridge for our sinfulness. Incorporating this perspective would have strengthened the connection to the concern raised."
