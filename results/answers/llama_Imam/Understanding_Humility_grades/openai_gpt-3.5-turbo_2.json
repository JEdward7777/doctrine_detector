The comparison with Islamic tradition is insightful and adds depth to the discussion. The explanation effectively addresses the concern regarding the nature of humility in relation to one's relationship with God from a Christian worldview. However, incorporating more specific references to Christian teachings or scripture could enhance the response further."
