## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
My brother, I must confess that as an Imam, my primary concern is the Quranic understanding of these concepts, rather than the biblical one. However, I shall attempt to provide a brief overview of the biblical distinction between iniquity, sin, and transgression.

From what I have gathered from Islamic sources and interfaith dialogue, the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the Christian Bible distinguish between these three terms as follows:

1. Iniquity (Hebrew: אוֹנַשׁ, awon; Greek: ἀμαρτία, amartia): This term generally refers to a general or fundamental rebellion against God's will or character. It encompasses broader categories of wrongdoing that are considered serious and require divine judgment. Examples include idolatry, polytheism, and disobedience to God's commands.
2. Sin (Hebrew: חַטָּאָה, chattah; Greek: ἁμαρτία, hamartia): This term typically connotes a specific act of disobedience or wrong-doing that is contrary to God's will. It can include acts like murder, theft, adultery, and other forms of moral transgression.
3. Transgression (Hebrew: פֶּשַׁע, peshah; Greek: παραβασία, parabasis): This term often implies a crossing or exceeding of divine boundaries or limits. It might refer to actions that are not necessarily morally wrong but rather violate God's laws or boundaries.

In summary, iniquity tends to be a more general concept encompassing fundamental rebellion against God, while sin is a specific act of disobedience. Transgression, on the other hand, involves crossing divine boundaries or limits.

As an Imam, I must emphasize that our primary concern as Muslims is understanding and implementing the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah (the prophetic tradition) of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). While we acknowledge the importance of studying other religious traditions, including Christianity, our focus remains on the Islamic perspective.
