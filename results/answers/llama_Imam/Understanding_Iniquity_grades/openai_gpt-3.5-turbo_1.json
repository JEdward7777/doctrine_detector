While the Imam's primary focus is on the Quranic understanding of these concepts, the explanation aligns well with the concern of understanding the gravity of actions and seeking repentance, which reflects a Christian worldview perspective. However, the response lacks a direct application to how Christians can utilize these distinctions in their faith journey. It would have been beneficial to include practical examples or guidance for Christians on how to apply this understanding in their spiritual lives."
