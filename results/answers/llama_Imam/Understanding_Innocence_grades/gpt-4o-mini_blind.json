  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments:\nWhile the student made a commendable effort to provide insight into the concept of \"innocent\" in the biblical context from an interfaith perspective, there are several theological inaccuracies and omissions in the response. The student attempted to connect the concept of innocence to justice and righteousness, which is positive but could have been supported with more specific biblical references. Additionally, the student's interpretation of \"innocent until proven guilty\" in biblical teachings could have been better explained with more direct scriptural support. The student correctly highlighted the association of innocence with God's favor and blessing but could have delved deeper into the theological implications of innocence in salvation through Christ. Overall, the response lacked depth and clarity in connecting the concept of innocence to broader Christian teachings."
