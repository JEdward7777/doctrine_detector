However, the answer included information from an Islamic perspective which deviated from the specific concern of deepening understanding of the Holy Spirit's involvement in prayer and intercession. The student could have focused more on elaborating on how the Holy Spirit's intercession is portrayed in the Bible without bringing in beliefs from a different faith tradition."
