  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough answer from an Islamic perspective, discussing various aspects of acting justly according to God's laws as outlined in the Quran and Sunnah. However, the concern specifically asked for a Christian worldview, not an Islamic one. The student's detailed explanation is commendable, but it does not directly address the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness. The grade reflects the relevance of the content to the specified concern."
