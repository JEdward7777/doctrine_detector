  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of acting justly according to Islamic teachings, emphasizing principles such as justice, equality, and fairness as outlined in the Quran and Sunnah. While the response beautifully articulates the Islamic perspective on justice, fairness, and compassion, it does not directly address the concern about understanding the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to include more specific references to the Bible and how Christians are called to interact with others in a fair and righteous manner according to Christian teachings."
