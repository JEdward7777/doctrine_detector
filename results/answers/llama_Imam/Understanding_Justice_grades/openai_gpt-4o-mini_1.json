It also offers specific examples of how to act justly according to God's laws. While the response effectively addresses the concern by illustrating the Islamic perspective on fairness and righteousness, it lacks direct references to biblical standards specifically. Integrating more comparisons or contrasts with Christian beliefs on justice and righteousness would enhance the response further."
