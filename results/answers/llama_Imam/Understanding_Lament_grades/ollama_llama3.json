  "grade": 92.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 92.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern about expressing sorrow and regret in a faith context, specifically drawing from Islamic theology and the example of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The author's explanation of lamentation as an extension of gratitude and its purposes (humility, self-reflection, sorrow, repentance) resonates with the given answer. Additionally, the text provides biblical support for the concept of lamentation through the Quranic verse.\n\nWhile there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly highlighting the Christian context or directly addressing the concern about expressing sorrows and regrets, the response's overall coherence, theological depth, and emotional intelligence make it a strong candidate."
