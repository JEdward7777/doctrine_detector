The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of expressing sorrow and remorse in a faith context. However, from a Christian worldview, while there are similarities in the value of lamentation, there are also key differences in understanding redemption and forgiveness through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Clarifying these distinctions could further enhance the response."
