Assalamu alaikum, dear brother.

In the Quran, we're told that Allah is the only Lord worthy of worship (Quran 3:64). In Islam, we believe that the concept of "Lord" (Rabb) refers specifically to God, the Almighty Creator and Sustainer of the universe. It's a term of reverence and obedience, signifying the unique role of God as the sole object of worship.

Now, in relation to Jesus, the Bible uses the term "Lord" in different contexts. In some passages, it seems to imply that Jesus is Lord in a sense similar to how we Muslims use the term Rabb (God) for Allah. For example, Philippians 2:9-11 says, "Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." Here, Jesus is referred to as "Lord" (Kyrios) in a way that seems to be equivalent to the divinity and lordship of Allah.

However, other passages in the Bible suggest that Jesus' lordship is more related to his messianic role and authority, rather than being explicitly equated with God. For instance, Acts 10:36-43 describes Peter's sermon on the importance of Jesus as Lord and Messiah, highlighting his teachings, miracles, and sacrifice.

In Islamic theology, we believe that Jesus was a noble prophet and messenger of God (peace be upon him), but not divine or equal to Allah. We acknowledge his role in conveying divine messages and performing miracles, but reject any notion of Jesus being part of the Trinity or having divine nature.

In conclusion, when considering the Bible's usage of "Lord" in relation to Jesus, it seems that some passages may imply a level of divinity or equivalence with God, while others emphasize his human prophetic role. As Muslims, we affirm the importance of acknowledging Jesus as a messenger of God (peace be upon him), but maintain our theological distinction between Jesus' status and that of Allah, who is the one true Lord worthy of worship.

Waswasa alaikum, may this answer bring you guidance and clarity!
