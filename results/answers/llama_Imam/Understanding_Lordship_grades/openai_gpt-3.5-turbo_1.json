  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough comparison between the Islamic and Christian perspectives on the term \"Lord\" in relation to Jesus and God. While the student accurately addresses the significance of the term in both faith traditions, there is a lack of clarity in asserting that the Bible explicitly communicates Jesus as God through the term \"Lord.\" The integration of additional scriptural references and a more explicit connection to the divinity of Jesus within Christian theology would strengthen the argument. Overall, the response demonstrates critical thinking and understanding but falls short in fully addressing the concern raised from a Christian worldview perspective."
