However, the response primarily focuses on comparing Islamic and Christian perspectives without clearly affirming the Christian belief in Jesus as divine. To fully address the concern from a Christian worldview, it would be important to emphasize the understanding of Jesus as both Lord and God as integral to Christian theology."
