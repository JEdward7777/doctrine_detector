The response effectively addressed the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the significance of the term \"Lord\" in relation to recognizing Jesus' authority and divinity. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly refuting the claim that the term \"Lord\" inherently signifies Jesus as God in the Christian worldview. Adding more scriptural references from the Bible and the Quran to support the arguments presented would have further enhanced the response."
