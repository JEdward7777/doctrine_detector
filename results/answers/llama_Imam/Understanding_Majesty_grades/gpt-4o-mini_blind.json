  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 70. \n\nWhile the student demonstrates a solid understanding of Islamic theology and the concept of majesty within that framework, the response would receive a lower grade from a Christian worldview due to the theological differences between Islam and Christianity, particularly concerning the nature of God and His attributes. In a Christian perspective, the emphasis would be on God's majesty as His sovereign authority, righteousness, holiness, and transcendence, distinct from Islamic theology which may not fully align with Christian beliefs about God's nature. Additionally, the focus on the attributes of power, wisdom, and benevolence, though important, does not fully capture the richness of God's majesty as understood within Christianity. The response could be improved by including references to biblical passages that highlight God's majesty and by articulating it from a Christian doctrinal standpoint."
