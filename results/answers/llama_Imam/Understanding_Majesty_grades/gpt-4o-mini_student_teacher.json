  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of how the term 'majesty' is understood in Islamic theology and its importance in relation to Allah, the response did not directly address the Christian perspective on this term. The main concern from a Christian worldview is to understand God's attributes and His sovereignty over creation. \n\nThe student's answer, although informative and well-written, does not align with the specific Christian view of 'majesty' as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on explaining how the term 'majesty' signifies the greatness and splendor of God as the supreme King over the universe, emphasizing His sovereignty and attributes, within a Christian context."
