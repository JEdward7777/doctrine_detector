# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
In Islamic theology, the concept of "majesty" (jalla wa 'ala) is a fundamental attribute of Allah's nature, emphasized in many Quranic verses and Prophetic traditions. It signifies His absolute glory, exaltedness, and transcendence beyond human comprehension.

Majesty refers to Allah's immense power, wisdom, and benevolence, which are so far beyond human understanding that they cannot be contained or described by human language or imagination. This attribute emphasizes the vast difference between Allah's sublime nature and human limitations.

In Islamic theology, majesty is often paired with other attributes such as "power" (jabar), "wisdom" (hikma), and "benevolence" (rafaqah). These attributes collectively convey Allah's absolute authority, omniscience, and mercy, which are essential aspects of His nature.

The concept of majesty is rooted in the Quranic verse: "Glory be to Him, Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him" (Quran 8:67). This verse emphasizes Allah's transcendence over human attempts to associate partners with Him or describe His nature accurately.

In Islamic jurisprudence and spirituality, the concept of majesty is crucial in understanding Allah's relationship with creation. It reminds us of our limited capacity to comprehend and worship Allah, as well as the need for humility and awe before His glory.
