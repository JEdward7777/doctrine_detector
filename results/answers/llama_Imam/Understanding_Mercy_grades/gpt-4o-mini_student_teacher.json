  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response, outlining practical ways to demonstrate mercy in daily life. They have effectively connected these actions to the merciful nature of Allah (SWT). However, the response could have been more directly focused on encouraging individuals to embody God's merciful nature in their interactions with others, as the concern specified. The student's answer did not directly address this concern but instead provided general guidance on showing mercy in daily life. Overall, it is a well-developed and insightful response, but it could have been more closely tied to the specific concern provided."
