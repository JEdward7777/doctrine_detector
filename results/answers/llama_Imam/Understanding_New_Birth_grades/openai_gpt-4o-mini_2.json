  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian concept of being \"born again\" and effectively compares it to Islamic theology while respecting both faith traditions. The student effectively addresses the concern by discussing the foundational aspect of spiritual rebirth in Christian faith and provides a well-reasoned explanation based on Christian scriptures. Great job in integrating knowledge from both faith perspectives with respect and understanding."
