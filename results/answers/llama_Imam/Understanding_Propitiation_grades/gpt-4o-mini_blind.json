The answer should have discussed how, in Christian belief, Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was a propitiatory sacrifice to atone for the sins of humanity and restore a right relationship with God. Additionally, the explanation of Islamic beliefs could have been more concise and focused on addressing the Christian perspective presented in the question."
