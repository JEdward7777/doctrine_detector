However, from a Christian worldview, the key concern is not adequately addressed. The response does not engage with the importance of propitiation in satisfying God's justice and appeasing His wrath, which are central themes in understanding the Christian view of Jesus' sacrifice. In a Christian perspective, Jesus' sacrifice is seen as necessary to address the inherent sinfulness of humanity and reconcile them with a holy and just God. Therefore, a deeper exploration of how propitiation is connected to God's justice and mercy is essential for a more comprehensive evaluation."
