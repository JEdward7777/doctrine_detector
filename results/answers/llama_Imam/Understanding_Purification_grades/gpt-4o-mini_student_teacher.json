  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of the significance of purification in the context of Old Testament laws from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing spiritual cleanliness and separation from impurities. However, the answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not fully address the concern of how the process of ritual purification reflects God\u2019s standards for holiness and the nature of sin as outlined in the Old Testament. Additionally, while the student's insights on purification practices are informative, they do not align closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
