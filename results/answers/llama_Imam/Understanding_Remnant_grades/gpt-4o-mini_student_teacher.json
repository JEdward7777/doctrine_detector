  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a thoughtful response drawing parallels between the concept of \"remnant\" in the Bible and Islamic teachings, the answer did not directly address the concern of understanding the source of strength during difficult times. The response focused more on the actions inspired by the concept of \"remnant\" rather than delving into the source of strength that believers draw upon in times of persecution. It would have been beneficial for the student to elaborate on how the faith and trust in God's providence, as exemplified by the remnant in the Bible, serve as a source of strength for believers facing persecution."
