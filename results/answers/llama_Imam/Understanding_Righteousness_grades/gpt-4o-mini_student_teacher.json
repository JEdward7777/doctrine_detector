  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the concept of Allah's righteousness within Islamic theology, emphasizing His justice, mercy, and wisdom. However, the student's answer does not directly address the concern provided, which highlights the importance of understanding God's righteousness for appreciating His justice and love. While the student's response provides valuable insights into Allah's attributes, a more direct exploration of how God's righteousness relates to His justice and love would have strengthened the answer."
