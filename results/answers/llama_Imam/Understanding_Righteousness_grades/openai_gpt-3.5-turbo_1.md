Assalamu alaikum, dear brother/sister!

In Islamic theology, the concept of Allah's righteousness (al-muṣawī) is deeply rooted in our understanding of His attributes. In the Quran, Allah is described as Al-Muṣawī (ar-Rāḥimān), which means "The Righteous" or "The One Who does good."

In this context, Allah's righteousness refers to His absolute justice, mercy, and benevolence towards all creation. It implies that He is the ultimate source of goodness, morality, and wisdom. As the Just Judge (al-Hakam al-Muṣawī), Allah is said to have created the universe with a clear purpose: to guide humanity towards good deeds and righteousness.

The Quran describes Allah's righteousness in several ways:

1. Justice: Allah is Just, meaning He rewards those who do good and punishes those who commit evil. This justice is based on His omniscience (all-knowing) and omnipotence (all-powerful).
2. Mercy: Allah is Merciful, showing compassion to all creation, including the believers and non-believers. His mercy is limitless, guiding humans towards righteousness.
3. Wisdom: Allah's wisdom is infinite, allowing Him to create a universe with balance, harmony, and purpose.

In Islamic theology, Allah's righteousness has several implications:

1. Moral guidance: As the source of good morals, Allah's righteousness sets the standard for human behavior, encouraging us to follow His commandments and prohibitions.
2. Judgment Day: The concept of Allah's righteousness is also linked to the Hereafter (the afterlife). On Judgment Day, Allah will judge humanity based on their actions, rewarding those who followed His guidance and punishing those who disobeyed Him.
3. Sustenance: Allah's righteousness is also reflected in His sustenance of creation. He provides for all living beings, guiding them towards their purpose.

In summary, Allah's righteousness embodies His justice, mercy, wisdom, and benevolence towards all creation. It serves as a moral compass, guiding humanity to follow His guidance and ultimately leading us to the Hereafter.
