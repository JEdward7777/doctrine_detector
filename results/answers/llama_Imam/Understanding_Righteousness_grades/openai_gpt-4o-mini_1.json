It effectively connects the concept to moral guidance, Judgment Day, and sustenance, reflecting a deep understanding of the topic. However, there is no direct reference to the Christian concept of God's righteousness, which could have enriched the comparison and analysis in relation to the concern raised. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the Islamic perspective on the attribute of God's righteousness."
