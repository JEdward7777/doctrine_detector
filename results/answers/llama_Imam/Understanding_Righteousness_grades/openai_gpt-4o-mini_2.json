  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of Allah's righteousness in Islamic theology, highlighting aspects such as justice, mercy, and wisdom. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how understanding God's righteousness is essential for appreciating His justice and love. However, since the answer provided in the beginning differs slightly from the Islamic perspective by focusing on God's absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love without referencing specific attributes like mercy and wisdom, the grade is slightly lower than perfect. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective."
