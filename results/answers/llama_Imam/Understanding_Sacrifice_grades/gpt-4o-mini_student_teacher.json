  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response drawing on Islamic perspectives, but the answer did not align with the Christian specific worldview and the concern given. The explanation given does not reflect the Christian belief in Jesus as the sacrificial lamb who atones for human sin, missing the core Christian understanding of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption."
