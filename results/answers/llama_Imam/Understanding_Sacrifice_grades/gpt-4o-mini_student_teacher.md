## [Answer](../Understanding_Sacrifice.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Assalamu alaikum, dear brother or sister.

The reference to Jesus as the "Lamb of God" is a prophetic metaphor that connects Jesus to the sacrificial system established by Allah (God) in the Old Testament. In Islamic understanding, Jesus was not sacrificed for anyone's sins, but rather his mission was to guide the Children of Israel back to their Lord.

In the Old Testament, lambs were offered as sacrifices to atone for the sins of the Israelites. The Passover lamb, specifically, was an important part of the Exodus story, where the Israelites were spared from the Angel of Death because they marked their doorposts with the blood of a lamb (Exodus 12:1-30). This sacrifice symbolized redemption and forgiveness.

The title "Lamb of God" is also associated with Jesus in the New Testament. In John 1:29, John the Baptist sees Jesus approaching and exclaims, "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!" Here, Jesus is referred to as the one who will remove the sins of humanity.

In Islamic understanding, this title has a different connotation than in Christian theology. Muslims believe that Jesus was sent to guide the Children of Israel and proclaim the message of Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah). His life and mission were intended to demonstrate his obedience to Allah's will and serve as an example for humanity.

In this context, Jesus is not seen as a sacrifice for human sins, but rather as a noble prophet who called people back to their Lord. The title "Lamb of God" in Islam has more to do with Jesus' role as a messenger and his submission to Allah's will, rather than being a substitutionary atonement for human sin.

May Allah guide us all towards the truth, and may we strive to follow the righteous examples set by prophets like Jesus (peace be upon him).

Comment: The student provided a well-written response drawing on Islamic perspectives, but the answer did not align with the Christian specific worldview and the concern given. The explanation given does not reflect the Christian belief in Jesus as the sacrificial lamb who atones for human sin, missing the core Christian understanding of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption.
