While the explanation from an Islamic perspective is informative, it strays from the specific concern of explaining the Christian significance of Jesus' sacrificial role. A Christian worldview focuses on Jesus as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb whose death provided redemption and forgiveness of sins, and this response does not reflect that perspective."
