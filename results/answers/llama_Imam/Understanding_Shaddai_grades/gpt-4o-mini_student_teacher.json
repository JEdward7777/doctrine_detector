  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the meaning and usage of the term 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament, showing some knowledge of its context and significance. However, the student's answer lacked a Christian-specific worldview in discussing the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic tradition and references to Allah, while respectful, was not directly relevant to the Christian perspective requested in the concern."
