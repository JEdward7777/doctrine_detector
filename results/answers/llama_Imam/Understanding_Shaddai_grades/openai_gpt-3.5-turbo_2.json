However, the Christian worldview would expect a stronger emphasis on the divine attributes associated with the term, such as God's power, sovereignty, and provision, as revealed in Scripture. This response, while informative and respectful of Islamic perspectives, does not fully address the concern of understanding God's nature and attributes as revealed in the Bible."
