As-salamu alaykum, dear brother or sister. I'm happy to help you with your question.

In the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), "Shaddai" (שַׁדַי) is one of the names used to refer to God. It appears 30 times in the OT and is often paired with other names like El or Yahweh.

The meaning of Shaddai is a bit tricky to translate directly into Arabic, but roughly it can be understood as "the Almighty" or "God of Power." Some interpreters have linked it to the Hebrew word "sadeh," which means "breast" or "nourishment," suggesting that God is the One who provides sustenance and nourishment. Others have connected it to the Akkadian word "shadu," meaning "destroyer" or "mighty one."

In the context of the Old Testament, Shaddai is used primarily in poetic and prophetic passages to emphasize God's power, majesty, and sovereignty over creation. For example:

* In Genesis 49:25, Jacob blesses his sons and refers to God as Shaddai, highlighting His power to protect and guide them.
* In Exodus 15:2-3, Moses sings a hymn to God after the Israelites cross the Red Sea, using the name Shaddai to describe God's mighty deeds.
* In Job 28:28 and 37:23, Shaddai is used to emphasize God's wisdom, power, and authority over all of creation.

In Islamic tradition, we recognize that Shaddai is one of the names of Allah (God) mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. While Muslims do not consider the OT a sacred text, we acknowledge its significance as part of the divine revelation given to the prophets of old, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

May Allah guide us all to understand His Names and Attributes, as revealed in the Quran and Sunnah (way of the Prophet). Ameen.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term "Shaddai" from a Christian perspective, highlighting its significance and usage in the Old Testament. It acknowledges the Hebrew context and the emphasis on God's power and sovereignty. However, it could have elaborated more on the specific attributes of God associated with the name Shaddai as revealed in Scripture, linking it to the Christian worldview more explicitly.
