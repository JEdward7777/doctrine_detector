  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 60.\n\nComment: While the student provided some thoughtful insights and strategies on resisting temptation based on Islamic teachings, the response did not directly address the specific strategies Jesus used to resist Satan's temptations as mentioned in the reference answer. From a Christian worldview, the focus should remain on Jesus and His actions. Additionally, the response could have included more direct parallels between Islamic teachings and Christian beliefs on resisting temptation to better address the concern provided."
