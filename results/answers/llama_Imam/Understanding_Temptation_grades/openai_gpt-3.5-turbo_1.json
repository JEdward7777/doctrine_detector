While the response does not directly address the concern from a Christian perspective, it offers relevant strategies that align with principles commonly shared between Islam and Christianity, such as seeking divine guidance, staying focused on one's purpose, and relying on community support. It would have been stronger if there were more direct references to Christian scripture or teachings, but the response still provides meaningful content related to combatting temptation in daily life."
