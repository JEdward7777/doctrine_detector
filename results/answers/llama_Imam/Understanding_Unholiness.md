## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As Muslims, we believe that leading a righteous and holy life is the ultimate goal for every believer. The Quran reminds us that Allah has created us to worship Him alone, and that He has sent prophets and messengers to guide us towards this noble path.

In the Islamic tradition, an "unholy" or un-Islamic life (ghayri islami) refers to a way of living that deviates from the teachings and guidelines set forth by Allah and His Messenger, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Such a life is characterized by actions and behaviors that are contrary to the principles of faith, morality, and justice.

Some common characteristics of an unholy life might include:

1. Ignoring or rejecting the authority of Allah and His Messenger: This could manifest in refusing to pray, neglecting to follow the Five Pillars of Islam, or rejecting the Prophet's (peace be upon him) guidance.
2. Prioritizing worldly desires over spiritual growth: A person who becomes consumed by their own ego, material possessions, or fleeting pleasures is likely to abandon their pursuit of a holy life.
3. Engaging in sinful or immoral activities: This might include behaviors like lying, cheating, stealing, fornication, homosexuality, or other forms of disobedience.
4. Fostering discord and hostility towards others: A person who harbors malice, spreads rumors, or engages in gossip is not living a holy life.
5. Neglecting one's duties and responsibilities: Ignoring the rights of others, shirking important tasks, or failing to fulfill one's obligations as a husband, wife, parent, or member of society can all be indicative of an unholy way of living.
6. Engaging in usury (riba) or other forms of exploitation: Charging excessive interest rates, taking advantage of the vulnerable, or engaging in other exploitative behaviors is antithetical to the values of justice and compassion taught by Islam.
7. Failing to provide for one's own spiritual growth and development: Neglecting to seek knowledge, wisdom, or self-reflection can lead to stagnation and a lack of progress on the path towards righteousness.

In terms of identifying unholy characteristics in our actions or society, we must engage in introspection, self-reflection, and critical thinking. We should ask ourselves:

* Are my actions guided by the principles of faith, morality, and justice?
* Am I prioritizing spiritual growth and development over worldly pursuits?
* Do I harbor malice or ill will towards others?
* Am I neglecting my duties and responsibilities towards Allah, myself, and others?

As a society, we can identify unholy characteristics by observing:

* The prevalence of injustice, inequality, and exploitation.
* The spread of ignorance, superstition, and false knowledge.
* The rise of hedonism, materialism, and the pursuit of fleeting pleasures over spiritual fulfillment.
* The lack of compassion, empathy, and kindness towards others.
* The disregard for the well-being and dignity of creation (human, animal, or environmental).

By recognizing these characteristics and engaging in self-reflection and introspection, we can work towards leading a more righteous and holy life, guided by the teachings of Allah and His Messenger.
