The inclusion of self-reflection questions for individuals and societal observations is commendable. However, there are theological differences between Islamic beliefs and Christian beliefs regarding sin, righteousness, and priorities. From a Christian worldview, the concept of unholiness would also include a separation from God, violation of His commandments, and a lack of faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. Additionally, the response could benefit from referencing specific Quranic verses or Hadiths to support the points made. Overall, a solid analysis but lacking in Christian doctrinal correctness."
