  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response from an Islamic perspective on the characteristics of an \"unholy\" life. While the answer focused on the Islamic tradition and provided specific examples, it did not directly address the concern of self-examination and personal awareness of unholiness as encouraged in the question. Additionally, the emphasis on specific Islamic practices and beliefs, while valuable from a Muslim worldview, deviated from the Christian-specific worldview requested for the grading. It is important for the student to stay closely aligned with the given reference answer and concern in order to fully address the prompt."
