It addresses the concern by encouraging self-examination and awareness of how unholiness can impact personal and communal behavior. However, the response lacks specific references to the Christian worldview and does not draw parallels or contrasts between Islamic and Christian beliefs on holiness. A stronger connection to the Christian perspective on holiness would have further enhanced the response."
