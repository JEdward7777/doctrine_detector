  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of \"woe\" from an Islamic perspective, they did not directly address the Christian-specific understanding of the term in the context of biblical warnings and judgments. The answer focused more on Islamic beliefs and scriptures, which deviated from the Christian worldview context provided in the question. The response lacked a clear connection to the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment as outlined."
