  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-explained comparison between the Christian concept of \"woe\" as understood from biblical perspectives and the Islamic perspective on divine warning and judgment. The student effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating a clear understanding of the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment, while also offering a thoughtful comparison with Islamic beliefs. The response is respectful and informative, drawing parallels between the two faith traditions in a scholarly and academically sound manner."
