  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the concept of \"woe\" in both biblical and Islamic contexts, addressing the concern of understanding implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment. The student effectively compares and contrasts the use of \"woe\" in the Hebrew scriptures and the Quran, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective. The response could have been strengthened by further emphasizing the gravity of divine judgment and the necessity of repentance in both belief systems. Overall, a well-thought-out and informative response."
