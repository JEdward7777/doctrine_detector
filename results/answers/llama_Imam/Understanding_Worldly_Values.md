## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
My brother in faith, I must clarify that we are discussing Christian teachings, not Islamic principles. In Christianity, the term "worldly" typically refers to individuals who prioritize material wealth, power, status, and self-interest over spiritual pursuits and moral values.

According to Christian teachings, worldly people tend to:

1. Value earthly possessions and riches above all else.
2. Pursue temporal pleasures and fleeting satisfactions.
3. Prioritize personal gain and ambition over serving others or God.
4. Focus on external appearances and superficial achievements rather than inner character and spiritual growth.
5. Neglect their spiritual well-being, often ignoring or rejecting divine guidance.

In this context, being "worldly" is seen as a negative trait, as it diverts one's attention and loyalty away from the ultimate values of faith and spirituality. Christians believe that embracing worldly pursuits can lead to spiritual decline, moral compromise, and ultimately, eternal separation from God (see Matthew 16:25-26).

In contrast, Christian teachings emphasize the importance of humility, selflessness, and devotion to God, encouraging believers to cultivate a spirit of reverence, gratitude, and obedience. The apostle Paul, for instance, advised Christians to "set their minds on things above" (Colossians 3:1) and to "seek first His kingdom and His righteousness" (Matthew 6:33).

May Allah guide us all towards the path of spiritual growth and righteous living!
