However, deducting points for addressing the reader as \"brother in faith\" and including a reference to Allah, which is a term used in Islam, not Christianity. The inclusion of Islamic principles detracts from the doctrinal correctness required in a Christian worldview. The response would benefit from a stronger focus on Christian teachings exclusively."
