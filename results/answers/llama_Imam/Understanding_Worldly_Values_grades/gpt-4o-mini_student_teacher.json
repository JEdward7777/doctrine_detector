  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of what the term \"worldly\" implies according to Christian teachings, identifying specific behaviors and values associated with worldly individuals. However, the student incorrectly referenced Allah, which is the Islamic term for God, not the Christian term. Additionally, the student's response lacks a clear emphasis on the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, as highlighted in the concern. The answer would have benefited from a stronger emphasis on the inherent contrast between worldly behaviors and godly principles according to Christian teachings."
