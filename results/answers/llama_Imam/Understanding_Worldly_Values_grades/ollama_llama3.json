  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response shows a good understanding of the concept of \"worldly\" in Christian teachings, particularly highlighting the negative traits associated with it. It accurately contrasts worldly values with godly principles, emphasizing the importance of humility, selflessness, and devotion to God. The biblical references (Matthew 16:25-26, Colossians 3:1, Matthew 6:33) also demonstrate a good grasp of Christian teachings.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples of how worldly values manifest in daily life, rather than simply listing general negative traits. Additionally, while the inclusion of a Islamic phrase (\"May Allah guide us all...\") is not necessarily relevant to the topic at hand, it may detract from the overall focus on Christian teachings.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the contrast between worldly values and godly principles in Christian teachings, earning an 85% grade."
