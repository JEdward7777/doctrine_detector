The description of various forms of worship such as prayers, Quran recitation, charity, fasting, and Hajj is well articulated. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to highlight that worship in Christianity is centered on glorifying the Triune God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and acknowledging Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator between humanity and God. Additionally, emphasizing the uniqueness of Jesus Christ in salvation and the need for faith in Him would provide a more comprehensive perspective on the concept of worship."
