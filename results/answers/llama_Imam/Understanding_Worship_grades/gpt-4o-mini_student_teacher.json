  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response provides a thorough explanation of worship in Islam, the concern specifically asked for an understanding of worship in a Christian context. The student did not address the significance of worship in a Christian's life or reflect on the relationship with God aspect mentioned in the concern. It is important for the student to tailor their response to the specific worldview being discussed in the question."
