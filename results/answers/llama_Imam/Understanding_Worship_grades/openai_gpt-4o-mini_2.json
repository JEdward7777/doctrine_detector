However, from a Christian worldview concern, the response does not directly address the significance of worship in a Christian's life and its reflection of their relationship with God. To align more closely with the concern, the response could have provided a comparison or contrast between Islamic and Christian perspectives on worship and its impact on the believer's relationship with God."
