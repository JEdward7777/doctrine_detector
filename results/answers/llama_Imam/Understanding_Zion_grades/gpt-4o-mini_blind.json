However, since the question specifically asked for the significance within the context of Israel, the answer veered off into Islamic theology and interpretations that do not align accurately with Christian beliefs. It lacked a clear Christian worldview and did not address the term's significance within Judaism or Christianity, which are more pertinent to the question. The focus on Islamic scriptures and perspectives, while informative, did not fully address the Christian-specific understanding of the term \"Daughter of Zion.\""
