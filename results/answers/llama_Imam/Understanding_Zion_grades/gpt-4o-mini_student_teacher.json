  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response fails to address the Christian-specific understanding of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel. The student's answer focuses solely on an Islamic perspective, lacking the necessary analysis through the lens of a Christian worldview. A deeper exploration of the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people is missing in this response."
