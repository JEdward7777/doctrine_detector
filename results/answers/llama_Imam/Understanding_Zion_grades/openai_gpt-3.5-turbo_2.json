However, the answer does not directly address the concern about understanding the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people from a Christian worldview. Incorporating more analysis on how this metaphorical language reflects God's covenant and relationship with His people in Christianity would have strengthened the response."
