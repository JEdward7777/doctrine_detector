It demonstrates understanding of the metaphorical language used in Scripture and provides insights into the shared spiritual values between Islam and Judaism/Christianity. The connection between the term and God's care for the people of Israel is explained effectively. However, there could have been more emphasis on the implications of this metaphorical expression for the covenantal relationship between God and His people."
