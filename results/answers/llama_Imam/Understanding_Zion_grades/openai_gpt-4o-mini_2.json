The response effectively integrates Islamic perspectives and references to the Quran and hadiths to support the interpretation. However, the response could further emphasize the metaphorical nature of the term within the broader context of God's relationship with His people and the symbolic representation of Jerusalem as a central theme in religious texts. Strengthening the discussion on the metaphorical language and its implications would enhance the overall analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
