  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed comparison between Sheol and Hades from both Jewish and Christian perspectives, highlighting their implications for the fate of the righteous and unrighteous. However, there was a significant deviation from the biblical understanding by introducing elements of Greek mythology and Islamic beliefs, which were not directly relevant to the question posed. The response could have been improved by focusing solely on the biblical context and the distinction between the destinies of the righteous and unrighteous after death as outlined in the provided reference answer."
