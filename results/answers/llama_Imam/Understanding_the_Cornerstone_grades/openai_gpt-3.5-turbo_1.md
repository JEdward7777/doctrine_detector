# Answer by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
As an Imam, I must clarify that the concept of "cornerstone" is not unique to Islam or Christianity. In fact, it has its roots in Hebrew scripture and Jewish tradition.

In Islamic theology, we do acknowledge Jesus (peace be upon him) as a noble prophet sent by Allah (God) to guide his people. However, our understanding of Jesus' role and significance differs from the Christian perspective.

According to Christian scripture, Jesus is referred to as the "cornerstone" in several passages, including Psalm 118:22-23 and Ephesians 2:20. In this context, Jesus is seen as the foundation stone upon which the Church is built. This metaphor emphasizes his importance as the one who brings people together and provides a sense of unity and cohesion to the community.

From an Islamic perspective, we recognize that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a prophet and messenger of Allah, but we do not accept him as the Son of God or worship him as a deity. Instead, we believe that he was sent to guide his people and call them back to monotheism, rejecting polytheistic tendencies.

In our understanding, the role of Jesus (peace be upon him) is that of a prophet who brought guidance and wisdom to humanity. While we acknowledge his significance in Jewish scripture and tradition, we do not see him as the foundation or cornerstone of our faith.

The concept of "cornerstone" has a different connotation in Islamic theology. In Surah Al-Imran (3:103), Allah (God) is described as the "Foundation Stone" of all existence, upon which all things are built and sustained. This verse emphasizes Allah's role as the ultimate source of guidance, support, and unity for humanity.

In summary, while we acknowledge Jesus' (peace be upon him) importance in Christian scripture and tradition, our understanding of his role differs from the Christian perspective. As Muslims, we recognize him as a noble prophet but do not see him as the cornerstone of our faith or worship. Instead, we emphasize Allah's (God's) role as the ultimate source of guidance and unity for humanity.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the concept of "cornerstone" in Christianity. However, the response does not directly address the concern about how understanding the significance of Christ's role in the church can impact a believer's faith and community involvement. While the Islamic perspective is important to consider, the lack of discussion on this specific concern affects the overall relevance of the response in relation to the given answer and concern.
