  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the concept of \"cornerstone,\" contrasting it with the Christian view. However, there is a missing acknowledgment of how understanding the significance of Christ's role in the church as the foundational support can impact a believer's faith and community involvement. The response effectively presents the Islamic perspective but fails to address the concern from a Christian worldview, resulting in a lower grade."
