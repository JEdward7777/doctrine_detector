  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus in comparison to the Christian belief in him as the cornerstone of the Church. The analysis is well-informed and respectful of both faith traditions. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of Christ as the cornerstone in shaping the believer's faith and community involvement within a Christian worldview. A higher grade could have been achieved by more directly addressing how this understanding impacts Christian faith and communal engagement."
