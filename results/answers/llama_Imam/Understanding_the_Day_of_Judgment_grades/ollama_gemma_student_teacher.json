  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of Islamic theology and respectfully addresses the concern from a Christian worldview. They clearly explain the Islamic perspective on the Day of Judgment and the role of Allah as the judge, while acknowledging the significance of Jesus Christ as a prophet in Islam. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the Christian belief in Jesus Christ's divinity and his unique role as judge in that tradition."
