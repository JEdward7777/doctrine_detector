  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 70.\n\nThis response accurately corrects the misconception about Jesus' role in Islamic theology, explaining that Islam teaches Allah will judge individuals based on their deeds, not Jesus. It also provides Quranic references to support its claims and clarifies the role of Jesus as a prophet in Islam. The response effectively addresses the concern by providing an accurate understanding of Islamic beliefs.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about believers reflecting on the importance of their faith in Jesus or the implications of His role as judge, which is specifically mentioned in the original question. While it provides a helpful correction, it does not explicitly encourage reflection on the believer's own relationship with Jesus."
