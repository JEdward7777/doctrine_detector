However, the response lacks alignment with a Christian-specific worldview. From a Christian perspective, Jesus Christ is indeed believed to be the judge on the Day of Judgment based on biblical teachings (John 5:22, Matthew 25:31-46). The Islamic perspective presented in the response is informative but does not reflect the Christian understanding of Jesus' role as judge."
