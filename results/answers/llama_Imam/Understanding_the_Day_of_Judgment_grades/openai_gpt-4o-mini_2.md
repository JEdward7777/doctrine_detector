Jesus Christ, being sinless and possessing the perfect character of God, will judge people based on their lives and their relationship with Him.

This question helps believers reflect on the importance of their faith in Jesus and the implications of His role as judge.

## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Day_of_Judgment.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
I must correct you that there is no Islamic doctrine or scripture that suggests Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) will be the judge on the Day of Judgment. In fact, Islam teaches that the final judgment will be carried out by Allah (God) Himself, as stated in the Quran:

"And they ask you about the Hour: when it arrives, there is none that can delay it nor postpone it." (Quran 16:61)

In Islamic theology, the Day of Judgment (Yom al-Qiyamah) will be a day when all human beings who have ever lived will be resurrected and judged by Allah based on their deeds in this life. The Quran describes this event as follows:

"On that day, no soul shall have power over any other, nor shall they choose to amend or change what is done." (Quran 2:134)

Allah alone will judge each individual based on their actions, and the righteous ones will be rewarded with Paradise, while the wicked ones will be punished in Hell.

As for Jesus Christ (peace be upon him), he is considered a noble prophet in Islam, but his role is not that of a judge. In Islamic tradition, Jesus is viewed as one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity, and his mission was to convey the message of Tawhid (the Oneness of God) and the importance of following the Quranic teachings.

It's important to note that Islam rejects the Christian concept of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus Christ. In Islam, Jesus is considered a human prophet, not divine, and his role is limited to conveying Allah's message to humanity, rather than being a judge or savior.

I hope this clears up any misunderstandings about the significance of Jesus Christ in Islamic theology and the nature of the Day of Judgment.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided correctly addresses the concern raised by highlighting the importance of faith in Jesus and the implications of His role as judge. However, the response lacks alignment with a Christian-specific worldview. From a Christian perspective, Jesus Christ is indeed believed to be the judge on the Day of Judgment based on biblical teachings (John 5:22, Matthew 25:31-46). The Islamic perspective presented in the response is informative but does not reflect the Christian understanding of Jesus' role as judge.
