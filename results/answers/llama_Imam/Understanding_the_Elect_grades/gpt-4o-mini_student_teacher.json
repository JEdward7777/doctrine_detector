While the student's answer demonstrates an understanding of the topic and makes an effort to bridge the two faiths, there is a lack of clarity in connecting the significance of being chosen by God to one's faith journey, as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. The response could have been more focused on the implications of being chosen by God in shaping one's spiritual journey."
