  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer a 70.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the \"House of God\" in both the biblical and Islamic contexts. They have accurately referenced the biblical origin of the term and its significance within Judaism. However, the answer falls short in providing a purely Christian perspective on the term \"House of God.\" The discussion on the Islamic perspective, while informative, is not directly relevant to the question asked within a Christian worldview. \n\nAdditionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological implications of the \"House of God\" in Christianity, focusing on the New Testament teachings about believers being the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19) and the corporate body of believers being described as the Church (Ephesians 2:19-22).\n\nOverall, while the response demonstrates knowledge and effort, it lacks a strong focus on a Christian-specific worldview when addressing the concept of the \"House of God.\""
