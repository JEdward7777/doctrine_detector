  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the concept of the \"House of God\" in biblical context, drawing parallels between the Hebrew Bible and Islamic scripture. However, the response could have been more focused on the specific significance and meaning of the term in the Bible, rather than branching out into comparisons with Islamic beliefs. Additionally, while the student accurately described the idea of God dwelling among His people in the tabernacle or temple, there was some unnecessary elaboration that deviated from the main point."
