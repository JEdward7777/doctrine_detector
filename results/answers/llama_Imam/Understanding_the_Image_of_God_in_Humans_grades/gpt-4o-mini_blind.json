The references to Allah and Quranic verses do not align with the biblical definition of God and the image in which humans were created. The answer should focus more on the Christian understanding of the imago Dei, emphasizing qualities such as moral agency, rationality, relational capacity, and stewardship over creation as reflections of God's image in humanity. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include biblical references to support the characteristics listed. The response does touch on some common aspects shared between Islamic and Christian beliefs, but it falls short in addressing the specific biblical perspective on this topic."
