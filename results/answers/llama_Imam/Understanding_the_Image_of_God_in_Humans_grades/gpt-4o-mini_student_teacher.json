  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of humans reflecting the image of God from an Islamic perspective, but it deviates from the biblical definition provided in the reference answer. While the response highlights some valuable qualities such as creativity, love, and moral agency, it lacks focus on key characteristics like the ability to feel emotion, reason, communicate, and possess an eternal spirit, as outlined in the reference answer. The student's insights are insightful but could have been improved by aligning more closely with the given biblical definition."
