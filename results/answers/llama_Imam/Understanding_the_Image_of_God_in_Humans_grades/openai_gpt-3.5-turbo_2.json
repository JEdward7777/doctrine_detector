  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-developed explanation of human characteristics that reflect the image of God, drawing from both Islamic and biblical teachings. The integration of Quranic verses and qualities such as intellectual curiosity, moral agency, love and compassion, and creativity effectively addresses the concern of the question. The response could have further explored the theological implications of humans as vicegerents of Allah on Earth to deepen the understanding of what it means to be created in the image of God. Overall, it demonstrates a thoughtful reflection on the topic from an Islamic perspective."
