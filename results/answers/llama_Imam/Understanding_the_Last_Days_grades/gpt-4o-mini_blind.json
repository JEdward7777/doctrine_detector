However, from a Christian worldview, there are significant theological differences regarding the events surrounding Jesus' return and the End Times. The answer lacks a comparison or contrast with Christian beliefs and does not address the significance of Jesus' first coming in Islam compared to the Christian belief in Jesus' role as the Son of God. Additionally, the absence of mentioning the importance of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection in Christian eschatology impacts the overall doctrinal accuracy."
