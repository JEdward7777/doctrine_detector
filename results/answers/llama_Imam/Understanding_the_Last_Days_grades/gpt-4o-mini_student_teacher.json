  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of Islamic eschatology regarding the Last Days, focusing on the return of Jesus (Isa) and the signs leading to the End Times in Islam. However, the answer did not directly address the Christian perspective on the 'last days' in relation to Jesus' first and second comings. The concern specified understanding major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith, which was not fully addressed in the response. The student demonstrated knowledge of Islamic beliefs in eschatology, but the answer strayed from the Christian-specific worldview required for this question."
