However, the concern raised is not directly addressed, as the focus is on Islamic beliefs rather than the Christian perspective. The response effectively explores the Islamic understanding of the End Times, but it lacks a comparison with the Christian perspective on the timeline of major Biblical events. Some aspects of the Christian faith and the timeline of Jesus' first and second comings could have been incorporated for a more comprehensive analysis."
