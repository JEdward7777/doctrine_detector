However, the emphasis on the Islamic perspective and the abrogation of the Law of Moses by the Prophet Muhammad detracts from the Christian-specific worldview needed for this question. It would have been more appropriate to focus solely on the commandments themselves as they were given to the Israelites without introducing Islamic beliefs. The response also lacks depth in explaining the significance and impact of these commandments within the context of the Old Testament and the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people."
