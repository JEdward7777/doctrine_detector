Assalamu alaikum brother, thank you for asking this question.

In the context of the Old Testament, Yahweh is the personal name of God given to Moses and later revealed to the Israelites as their Lord and Creator. The name Yahweh is considered sacred and set apart from other names used to describe God in the Hebrew Bible.

The name Yahweh is derived from the Hebrew verb "to be" (hayah), and it can be translated as "I am who I am" or "He who is." It signifies God's self-existence, eternity, and unchanging nature. The name Yahweh is often accompanied by the phrase "the Lord" (YHVH Adonai) in the Hebrew Bible.

In Islamic understanding, we acknowledge that Yahweh was a revelation of Allah's Name to the Israelites, as recorded in the Old Testament. However, we also believe that this name was specific to the Children of Israel and is not applicable to all humanity or considered a universal name for God.

In the Quran, we find references to Allah (God) using various names and attributes, such as Ar-Rahman (the Most Merciful), Al-Malik (the King), Al-Quddus (the Holy One), and As-Salam (the Source of Peace). These names convey the essence and qualities of Allah, which are inclusive and applicable to all people.

As Muslims, we believe that the name Yahweh is part of a broader revelation from Allah to guide humanity, including the Israelites. We also recognize the continuity between the revelation given to the Israelites through the prophets, including Moses, and the final revelation received by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), which is the Quran.

May Allah guide us all in understanding His names and attributes as revealed in the sacred texts of our respective traditions.
