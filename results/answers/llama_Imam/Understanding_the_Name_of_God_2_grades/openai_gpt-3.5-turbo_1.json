However, the concern was not fully addressed as the response did not explicitly connect the understanding of God's name to recognizing His nature and covenant with His people. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the Islamic perspective on the name Yahweh, it could have further emphasized the unique relationship between God and His chosen people in the context of the covenant. Overall, a solid explanation that could have been strengthened with more direct connections to the concern raised."
