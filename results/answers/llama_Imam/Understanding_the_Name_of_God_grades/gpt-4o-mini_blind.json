However, the response lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. It is important to note that the Christian understanding of \"Yahweh\" is as the personal name of the God of Israel, revealed in the Hebrew Bible, and holds a central place in the covenant relationship between God and His people. The response should have emphasized more on the uniqueness and sacredness of the name \"Yahweh\" in the Old Testament specifically, rather than equating it directly with Allah in Islamic tradition."
