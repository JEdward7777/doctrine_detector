The response does not adequately distinguish between the roles of judges in the Old Testament and Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior. Additionally, there is a lack of engagement with foundational Christian doctrines such as the atonement and the deity of Christ. More scriptural references and theological explanations could have strengthened the argument presented. The use of a Muslim greeting and references to Islamic beliefs are also not appropriate in a Christian worldview context. Further development of the theological connections and an alignment with Christian doctrine are needed for a higher grade."
