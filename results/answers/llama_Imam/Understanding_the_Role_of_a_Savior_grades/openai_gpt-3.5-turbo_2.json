It demonstrates an understanding of the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation and presents insightful connections between the roles of Old Testament judges and Jesus Christ as the ultimate Judge-Savior. The use of relevant Old Testament passages and the explanation of Jesus' fulfilment of God's plan for humanity further strengthens the theological perspective presented."
