The incorporation of relevant Old Testament passages and the emphasis on Jesus as the ultimate Judge-Savior is commendable. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how the Old Testament judges prefigured and pointed towards the eternal salvation brought by Jesus Christ. However, a more direct comparison between the temporary nature of the Old Testament judges and the eternal salvation provided by Jesus Christ would have strengthened the response further."
