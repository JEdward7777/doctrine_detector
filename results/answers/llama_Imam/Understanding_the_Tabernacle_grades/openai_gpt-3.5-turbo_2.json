The three main aspects discussed align well with the concern about the Tabernacle's importance in facilitating the Israelites' worship and connection with God. The response also effectively acknowledges the special nature of the Tabernacle as a place of divine presence and worship. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic theology and references adds depth to the explanation."
