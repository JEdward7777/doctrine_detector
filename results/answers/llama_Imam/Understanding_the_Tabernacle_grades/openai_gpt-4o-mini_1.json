Additionally, the response incorporates Islamic theology by acknowledging the Tabernacle as a divine institution given by Allah to the Israelites. The depth of insight and spiritual reflection in connecting the Tabernacle to the covenant, forgiveness, and guidance from God greatly enhances the understanding of its role in the Israelites' relationship with God."
