  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus' identity. The student effectively articulates the Islamic belief that Jesus is viewed as a prophet and messenger, not the Son of God. However, from a Christian perspective, the explanation provided does not align with the understanding of Jesus as the Son of Man in Christian belief, which emphasizes both His humanity and divinity. The response could have benefited from incorporating additional insights from the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of Man."
