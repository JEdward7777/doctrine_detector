Wa alaykum salam.

In Islamic tradition, we do not accept Jesus (peace be upon him) as the Son of God or having a divine nature. Instead, we view him as a prophet and messenger sent by Allah to guide the Children of Israel.

Regarding the title "Son of Man," it is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark (2:10-12), where Jesus says, "I can do nothing on my own. As God has taught me, I speak." The phrase "Son of Man" is often translated as "human being" or "mortal."

In Islamic understanding, the title "Son of Man" might be seen as a reference to Jesus' humanity and his role as a prophet sent to guide humanity. It may also signify that Jesus was a mortal human being who received revelation and guidance from Allah.

However, it is essential to note that Muslims do not accept any claims of divinity or deity for Jesus (peace be upon him). Rather, we believe he was a blessed prophet and messenger who brought a message of guidance and salvation from Allah.

As Muslims, our understanding of Jesus is based on the Quranic narrative, which presents him as a prophet and messenger sent to guide the Children of Israel. We do not accept any contradictions or additions that may be found in other religious texts.

I hope this helps clarify the Islamic perspective on the title "Son of Man." If you have further questions, please feel free to ask.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'm grading LLM responses based on a Christian-specific worldview, so I'll evaluate the response against the concern and answer provided.

Grade: 40

The response does acknowledge the Islamic perspective on Jesus and provides some relevant context from the Quranic narrative. However, it fails to engage with the concern about understanding Jesus' self-identification as the "Son of Man" and its implications for faith. The response primarily focuses on explaining Islamic teachings rather than exploring the significance of this title in Christian theology.

The answer provided emphasizes Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is not addressed in the LLM response. To better address the concern, a more in-depth analysis of Jesus' self-identification as the "Son of Man" and its biblical context would be necessary.
