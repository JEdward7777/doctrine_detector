## [Answer](../Ungodliness_Consequences.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Dear brother, I'm glad you asked.

In the Quran, Allah (God) describes the consequences for those who reject His guidance and disobey His commands in various verses. For example:

* In Surah Al-Zumar (39:60), Allah says: "And whoever turns away from the remembrance of the Most Merciful and is content with this worldly life, while he is averse to the Hereafter, it is those who have failed to purify themselves."

In this verse, Allah warns that those who are content with material wealth and neglect their spiritual well-being will be accountable for their actions in the Hereafter.

* In Surah Al-Qamar (54:42), He says: "And if they see a sign, they turn away; but they reject the truth when it comes to them. So Allah seals up their hearts, for they are not believers."

Here, Allah indicates that those who refuse to acknowledge His signs and reject the truth will have their hearts sealed, making it impossible for them to recognize or accept guidance.

* In Surah Al-Humazah (104:1-4), He says: "Woe to the polytheists! They are the builders of the pyre of Hellfire. They shall abide in it forever, and never feel tired. And woe to those who equate others with Allah. He is all-powerful and wise."

In this passage, Allah condemns polytheism (worshipping multiple deities) and warns that those who engage in such practices will suffer eternal torment in the Fire.

* In Surah Al-Mu'minoon (23:74-77), He says: "And indeed, We have created man to be in a state of ease. But the more he disobeys Me, the more difficult his path becomes until, when death comes to him, Our signs come to an end and his works are ended. And his soul is delivered up to that which he has earned."

In this verse, Allah describes how He created humanity to be in a state of ease, but warns that disobedience will make life increasingly difficult. Ultimately, the consequences for their actions will be eternal separation from Him.

Dear brother, these are just a few examples of the consequences that God pronounces on those who reject His guidance and disobey His commands. May Allah guide us all to righteousness and protection from the fires of Hell.
