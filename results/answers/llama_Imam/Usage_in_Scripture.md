## Answer given by [llama Imam](../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Salaam (peace be upon you). As a Muslim Imam, I must acknowledge that our primary scripture is the Quran, and our prophets are Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all). However, I shall attempt to provide an objective analysis of the term "Holy One" in the Old and New Testaments.

In the Old Testament:

1. Yahweh: The most common usage of "Holy One" refers to Yahweh, the God of Israel, emphasizing His divine nature (Isaiah 43:3; 45:15). This title underscores His transcendence, uniqueness, and moral perfection.
2. God's holiness: In some instances, "Holy One" describes God's holy character or His acts, highlighting His justice, righteousness, and mercy (Psalm 16:10; 103:1-2).
3. Israel as the Holy One: In a few cases, Israel is referred to as the "Holy One of God" (Luke 4:34), signifying their sacred role as the chosen people.

In the New Testament:

1. Jesus Christ: The term "Holy One" is often used in reference to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His divine nature and sinlessness (Acts 3:14; Mark 1:24). This title underscores His unique relationship with God the Father.
2. God's holiness: In some cases, "Holy One" describes God's holy character or His acts through Jesus Christ, highlighting redemption, salvation, and forgiveness (John 6:69).
3. The Holy Spirit: Rarely, the term is used to describe the Holy Spirit as the divine guide and helper (Acts 7:55).

In summary, the term "Holy One" in the Old and New Testaments primarily refers to Yahweh, God's character, or Jesus Christ, emphasizing their unique relationship with God the Father. As a Muslim Imam, I must reiterate that our understanding of divine holiness is rooted in the Quranic concept of Tawhid (the Oneness of God), where Allah (God) is considered the sole Source of all goodness and purity.
