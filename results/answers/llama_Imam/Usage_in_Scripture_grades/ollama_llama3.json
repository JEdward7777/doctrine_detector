Additionally, it provides a balanced view by highlighting the various contexts in which the term is used.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the response could be improved:\n\n* While the response does acknowledge Jesus' divinity, it could have delved deeper into the New Testament's exploration of his authority and divine nature.\n* The comparison between the Old and New Testaments is a good start, but could be further developed to highlight the continuity and discontinuity between the two testaments.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of biblical theology and shows potential for further development in exploring the divinity and authority of Jesus Christ."
