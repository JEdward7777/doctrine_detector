The reference to Jesus Christ as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament is correctly highlighted. However, while the response briefly mentions Jesus' divine nature and sinlessness, it does not delve deeply into exploring his authority and divinity as seen in the New Testament. A more thorough examination of specific passages or doctrines that emphasize Jesus' divinity would have strengthened the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
