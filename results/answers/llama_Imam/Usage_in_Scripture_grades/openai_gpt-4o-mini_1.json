It does not delve into the significance of Jesus being referred to as the \"Holy One\" in relation to His divinity and unique role in Christian theology. A more robust discussion on the divinity and authority of Jesus, particularly in connection to the term \"Holy One,\" would have provided a more thorough analysis from a Christian worldview."
