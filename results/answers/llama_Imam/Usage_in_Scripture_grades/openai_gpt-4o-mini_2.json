The response briefly mentions Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament but does not delve into His authority and divinity in a Christian specific worldview. A more in-depth analysis focusing on Jesus' divine nature, unique relationship with God the Father, and the implications of His title as the \"Holy One\" would have been more appropriate in addressing the concern from a Christian perspective."
