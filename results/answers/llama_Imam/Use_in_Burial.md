As-salamu alaykum, dear brother or sister.

In biblical times, myrrh was indeed used in burial practices, particularly among the ancient Israelites and other Semitic cultures. In fact, it's mentioned in the Bible itself. Myrrh was a valuable and sacred commodity, often used for its medicinal and aromatic properties.

According to the Gospel of Matthew (27:57-61), when Jesus Christ was crucified, his body was wrapped in linen cloth and myrrh was mixed with aloes (a type of fragrant resin) before being placed in a tomb. This practice is believed to have been influenced by Jewish burial customs at the time.

In ancient Israelite culture, myrrh was used for various purposes related to death and mourning:

1. Embalming: Myrrh was used as an ingredient in the embalming process to preserve the deceased's body. It helped to prevent decay and give off a pleasant aroma.
2. Anointing: Myrrh oil was used to anoint the dead, symbolizing the transition from life to death. This practice is mentioned in 1 Kings 5:3 (Hebrew Scriptures), where King Solomon instructs his workers to extract myrrh for the construction of his palace.
3. Incense offering: During funeral rites and mourning ceremonies, myrrh was burned as incense to honor the deceased and seek divine forgiveness.

In Islamic tradition, we find similar practices related to death and burial. Muslims wash and wrap the deceased in white cloth (kafan), and it's customary to use scented oils like rosewater or sandalwood during the preparation of the body for burial. However, myrrh is not specifically mentioned in Islamic texts or traditions.

In conclusion, myrrh played a significant role in biblical times, particularly in Jewish and early Christian practices related to death and burial. Its aromatic properties and medicinal uses made it a valuable commodity, and its inclusion in Jesus' burial rites highlights the importance of this substance in ancient cultures.

May Allah guide us on our journey through life and into eternity.
