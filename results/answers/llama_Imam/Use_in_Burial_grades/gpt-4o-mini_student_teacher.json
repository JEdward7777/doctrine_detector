  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of myrrh in biblical burial practices. However, the answer included information from Islamic tradition which was not directly relevant to the specific question about biblical times. The student effectively connected myrrh to its various uses in Jewish and early Christian practices related to death and burial. The response could have been improved by focusing solely on the biblical context and providing more specific details related to the use of myrrh in anointing and preparing dead bodies for burial."
