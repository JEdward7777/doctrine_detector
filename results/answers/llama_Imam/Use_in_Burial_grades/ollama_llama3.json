  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately addresses the concern of recognizing customs surrounding burial practices, providing a detailed explanation of myrrh's significance in biblical times, particularly among the ancient Israelites and early Christians. The text also explores its uses in embalming, anointing, and incense offerings during funeral rites and mourning ceremonies.\n\nWhile the response does not explicitly state that myrrh was used in preparing dead bodies for burial, it provides a thorough understanding of its importance in biblical times, which aligns with the concern of recognizing cultural contexts in scripture. The inclusion of Islamic traditions also demonstrates an appreciation for the diversity of customs surrounding death and burial.\n\nTo reach a higher grade, the response could have more explicitly connected myrrh's use to the anointing process, as mentioned in the answer. Additionally, while the response is well-written and informative, it may benefit from more concise summarization of its main points."
