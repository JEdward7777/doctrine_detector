Assalamu alaikum, brother. As an Imam, I'm happy to shed some light on this question.

In Islamic tradition, we recognize John the Baptist (known as Yahya ibn Zakariyya in Arabic) and Jesus (known as Isa ibn Maryam) as two important prophets sent by Allah. Now, regarding the title "Rabbi," which means "teacher" or "master" in Hebrew, here's what we know:

John the Baptist was referred to as Rabbi Yahya by the Jews of his time. This is mentioned in the Quran (3:39), where it says: "O you who believe! Fear Allah and be with those who fear Him, but do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is an enemy to you, so he may mislead you as a guide. And if you are misled, no one can guide you afterwards than Allah, or they who have taken shelter at His obedience. And it was said to them: 'Be you steadfast!' And they were told: 'Do not be weak-hearted! You should only say what is proper; the people will consider you as rabbi, knowing you are truthful.'" (Quran 3:39-41)

In this context, Rabbi Yahya is being praised for his upright character and prophetic message. He was a teacher and guide who called people to righteousness and warned them against Satan's whispers.

As for Jesus, the Quran also mentions him as Rabbi Isa (Quran 5:75). However, it's essential to note that Muslims believe Jesus was not the Son of God or the Messiah, but rather a prophet and messenger sent by Allah. The title "Rabbi" in this context likely refers to his role as a teacher and guide who conveyed the message of Allah.

In conclusion, both John the Baptist and Jesus were referred to as Rabbi in their respective contexts, signifying their roles as teachers and guides. However, Muslims believe that Jesus was not divine and did not possess any extraordinary powers or attributes that would set him apart from other prophets.
