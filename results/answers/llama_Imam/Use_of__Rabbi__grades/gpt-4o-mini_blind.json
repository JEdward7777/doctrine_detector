However, the response lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the titles and roles of John the Baptist and Jesus. It is important to provide a clear distinction between Islamic beliefs and Christian beliefs, particularly regarding the divinity of Jesus and His role as the Messiah according to Christian doctrine. Additionally, the response should have included relevant biblical references to support the assertions made regarding John the Baptist and Jesus."
