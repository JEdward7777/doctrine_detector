  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective, their answer did not directly address the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. Additionally, the student did not focus on the specific aspect of disciples referring to them as 'Rabbi.' The answer lacked a clear Christian perspective on the significance of the title 'Rabbi' and their roles as teachers within that context."
