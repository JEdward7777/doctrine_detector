  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of the term \"Rabbi\" in Islamic tradition, highlighting its meaning as a teacher or guide. It also provides specific Quranic references to support its claims about John the Baptist and Jesus being referred to as Rabbi Yahya and Rabbi Isa respectively. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical context and how it relates to Islamic tradition.\n\nHowever, I would deduct some points because the response does not directly address the concern about recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. While the response mentions their roles as teachers and guides, it does not explicitly acknowledge the reverence and esteem in which their teachings are held by Christians. Additionally, the response presents a Muslim perspective on Jesus, which may not fully align with Christian beliefs.\n\nOverall, I would give this response an 85, as it provides a clear and informative explanation of the term \"Rabbi\" in Islamic tradition, but falls short in directly addressing the concern about recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings."
