However, the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings is not fully addressed. It would be beneficial to emphasize the unique authority and divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, which sets Him apart from other prophets, including John the Baptist. This would help to better align the response with a Christian-specific worldview."
