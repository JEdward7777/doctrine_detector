However, from a Christian perspective, the explanation does not fully address the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' teachings. The response lacks emphasis on Jesus' divine nature and unique role as the Son of God and Savior, which is crucial in understanding the true significance of his teachings in Christian belief. The context of Jesus being called Rabbi in the Quran is not fully explored in light of Christian theology."
