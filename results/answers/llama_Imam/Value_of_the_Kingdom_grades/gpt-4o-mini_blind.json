  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provides a decent overview of some parables attributed to Jesus from a Muslim perspective and acknowledges the differences in understanding between Islam and Christianity regarding Jesus' teachings. However, the answer does not directly address the question asked about the parables Jesus used to describe the value of the kingdom of God. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to focus more on directly answering the question from a Christian perspective and providing accurate biblical references for the parables."
