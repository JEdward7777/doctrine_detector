However, the student missed directly addressing the concern of appreciating the worth and significance of the kingdom of God in our lives, which is crucial in this context. While it is commendable to acknowledge the differences in perspectives, a stronger emphasis on the specific parables Jesus used to describe the value of the kingdom of God would have been more aligned with the concern provided."
