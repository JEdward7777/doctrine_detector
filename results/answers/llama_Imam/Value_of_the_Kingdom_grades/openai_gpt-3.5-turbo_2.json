The Muslim perspective on Jesus and his teachings is respectfully addressed, and the shared moral lessons between Islamic and Christian traditions are well articulated. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the unique salvific aspect of the kingdom of God in Christian belief, as well as a clearer distinction between the respective roles of the Quran and the Bible in conveying spiritual truths."
