However, the focus on the comparison of the kingdom of God to various elements lacks depth in explicitly addressing the worth and significance of the kingdom of God in our lives, as required by the concern. More emphasis on the transformative power and value of the kingdom of God and how it should impact believers' daily living would have strengthened the discussion from a Christian specific worldview."
