  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the student provided verses from the Quran that address the defeat of Satan, the answer did not align with the Christian worldview as the question was seeking. The discussion of Allah and Quranic verses is not relevant in this context. The specific promise regarding the defeat of Satan as referenced in the Bible was not addressed, resulting in a low grade for not directly answering the question from a Christian perspective."
