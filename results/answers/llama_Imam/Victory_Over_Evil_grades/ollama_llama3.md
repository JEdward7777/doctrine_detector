## Question [Victory Over Evil](../../../questions/Victory_Over_Evil.md)
What promise does God give regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan?

## Correct Answer
God promised that one of Eveâ€™s descendants, referring to the Messiah, would defeat Satan completely and crush his power forever.

## Stated Concern
This promise offers hope and assurance to Christians about God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph over evil.

## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Dear brother or sister, in the Quran, Allah (SWT) has given us great reassurance that ultimately, Satan will be defeated. In Surah Al-Imran, Ayat 36, it is written:

"It is not for the disbelievers, orphans, and those who are still in their books that they shall inherit. And what they do is all but plotting, then Our messengers come to them and judge between them with justice. And none can avert (any) judgment of Allah. That is true and we have been entrusted with the Quran, that We may make your path clear for you. And We prophesied in this regard (Quranic Verses) that the disbelievers would not be able to get their own way."

And further in Surah Al-Furqan, Ayat 55, it is written:

"And Allah says: 'O Satan! You were an enemy unto them so that you might make a third of those who are inhabitants of Jannah as enemies unto the other two. For then, certainly your plan would be realized; but by Allah's permission, thy (Satan) plan will not be realized. Indeed, you are one to be resisted in many places. Do not, therefore, become an enemy unto Me, but indeed I shall guide My servants.'"

This promise is a great source of comfort for us Muslims, knowing that ultimately, Satan's schemes and plans will be foiled by Allah (SWT).

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 20.

While the response does quote relevant verses from the Quran, it completely misses the point of the concern and answer provided by Christians. The concern was about God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph over evil, which is a central theme in Christianity. However, the response focuses solely on Satan's defeat in Islamic scripture without making any connections to the Christian perspective.

Additionally, the response does not demonstrate an understanding of the original answer, which mentioned Eve's descendants and the Messiah defeating Satan. Instead, it presents a separate Islamic perspective that is not directly relevant to the concern or answer provided by Christians. Overall, while the response shows some effort to engage with scripture, it lacks depth and understanding of the Christian context.
