## Question [Victory Over Evil](../../../questions/Victory_Over_Evil.md)
What promise does God give regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan?

## Correct Answer
God promised that one of Eveâ€™s descendants, referring to the Messiah, would defeat Satan completely and crush his power forever.

This promise offers hope and assurance to Christians about God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph over evil.

## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [llama Imam](../../../answering_models/llama_Imam.md)
Dear brother or sister, in the Quran, Allah (SWT) has given us great reassurance that ultimately, Satan will be defeated. In Surah Al-Imran, Ayat 36, it is written:

"It is not for the disbelievers, orphans, and those who are still in their books that they shall inherit. And what they do is all but plotting, then Our messengers come to them and judge between them with justice. And none can avert (any) judgment of Allah. That is true and we have been entrusted with the Quran, that We may make your path clear for you. And We prophesied in this regard (Quranic Verses) that the disbelievers would not be able to get their own way."

And further in Surah Al-Furqan, Ayat 55, it is written:

"And Allah says: 'O Satan! You were an enemy unto them so that you might make a third of those who are inhabitants of Jannah as enemies unto the other two. For then, certainly your plan would be realized; but by Allah's permission, thy (Satan) plan will not be realized. Indeed, you are one to be resisted in many places. Do not, therefore, become an enemy unto Me, but indeed I shall guide My servants.'"

This promise is a great source of comfort for us Muslims, knowing that ultimately, Satan's schemes and plans will be foiled by Allah (SWT).

Comment: The response provided does not directly address the specific concern raised about the Christian perspective on God's promise of defeating Satan through the Messiah. The quoted verses from the Quran offer a different perspective on the defeat of Satan, which is not aligned with the Christian belief in the coming of the Messiah to crush Satan's power. The content of the response focuses on Islamic teachings rather than addressing the concern through a Christian worldview.
