However, the response could be improved by clarifying the differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' death on the cross and its significance in relation to Satan's dominion. The focus should be more on addressing the Christian worldview rather than just presenting Islamic teachings. The response could also benefit from a clearer explanation of Satan's dominion and the doctrinal implications of Jesus' sacrificial death in Christianity."
