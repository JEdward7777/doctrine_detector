  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the significance of Jesus' death on the cross in the context of Satan's dominion, drawing on Islamic scriptures and traditions. The student clearly explains how Islamic teachings interpret the event as a victory for good over evil and highlights the limitations of Satan's power. The response is well-written and provides relevant textual evidence to support the claims made. However, it would be more effective if the student had directly addressed the Christian-specific worldview mentioned in the prompt."
