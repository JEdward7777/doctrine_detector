While it touches on the idea that Jesus' death was a manifestation of Allah's will, it does not delve deeper into what this means for believers in terms of their relationship with God or their spiritual growth.\n\nThe response also prioritizes Islamic scriptures and Hadith over Christian perspectives, which may not be directly relevant to the concern. To better address the concern, the response could explore how Christ's victory on the cross affects believers' daily lives, such as by providing hope, forgiveness, or empowerment. Additionally, it could discuss how this understanding can inform our prayer life, worship, or evangelism.\n\nOverall, while the response shows some understanding of Islamic perspectives on Jesus' death, it falls short in addressing the concern and exploring the implications for believers."
