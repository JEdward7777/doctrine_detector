The inclusion of specific practices such as cultivating gratitude, consistent prayer life, reading Scripture, forgiveness, compassion, worship, seeking guidance, engaging in acts of worship, cultivating humility, and seeking spiritual growth, demonstrates a thoughtful approach to living out one's faith. The integration of Islamic teachings with Christian principles, while well-intentioned, may have blurred the distinct Christian perspective at times. Nonetheless, the response effectively addresses the concern and offers meaningful guidance for Christians seeking to honor God in their everyday lives."
