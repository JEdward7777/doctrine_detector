  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The response provides a decent overview of how the term \"Word of God\" is understood in Christian tradition, mentioning key aspects such as the Logos, the Bible, and inspired writings. However, it could have delved deeper into the theological significance of the term within Christianity and elaborated more on how this concept shapes Christian beliefs and practices. Additionally, while the student did a good job acknowledging the differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on revelation, further discussion on the implications of these differences could have enriched the response."
