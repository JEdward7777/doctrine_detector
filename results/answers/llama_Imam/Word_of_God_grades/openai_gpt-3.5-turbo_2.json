The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting that the term 'word of God' encompasses both spoken and written messages, including the messages found in scriptures and in the person of Jesus. The response could have further emphasized the Christian belief in the divine nature of Jesus as the Word, aligning it with the concern of understanding the significance of God's communication to humanity."
