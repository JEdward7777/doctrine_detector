  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65/100\n\nComment: The student has provided a general understanding of the concept of zeal in Christian teachings, explaining its significance and manifestations. However, the response lacks depth and fails to fully capture the theological richness and nuances associated with zeal in a Christian context. Additionally, the attempt to draw parallels between Christian zeal and Islamic principles is informative but could be strengthened with more specific examples and contrasts. Overall, while the student shows some understanding, there is room for improvement in providing a more comprehensive and doctrinally accurate explanation."
