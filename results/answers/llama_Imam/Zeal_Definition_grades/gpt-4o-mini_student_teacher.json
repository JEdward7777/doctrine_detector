  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of zeal in the Christian context and made an effort to compare it to Islamic concepts. However, the student's response lacked a strong focus on the biblical context of zeal, as the concern highlighted as essential for proper understanding and application in a believer's life. Additionally, while the student accurately explained zeal in Christianity, the comparison to Islamic teachings could have been more focused on how understanding the biblical context of zeal is crucial for believers."
