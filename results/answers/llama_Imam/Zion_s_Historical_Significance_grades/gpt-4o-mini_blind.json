However, the answer adopts an Islamic perspective, which is inconsistent with the Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, the historical significance of Mount Zion in relation to King David largely revolves around its role in the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel and its association with Davidic covenant and messianic promises. The answer would benefit from including Christian biblical references and interpretations related to Mount Zion and King David."
