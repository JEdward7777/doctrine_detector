However, the focus was primarily on Islamic beliefs and narratives, deviating from the concern of understanding the importance of Mount Zion in the biblical narrative and its connection to key figures in Scripture. The response did not directly address the biblical significance of Mount Zion within the context of Christianity, which is the key aspect of the concern provided."
