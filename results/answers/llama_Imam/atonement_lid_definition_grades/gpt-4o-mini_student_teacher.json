However, the response is lacking in focusing on the core aspect of the atonement lid as representing God's mercy in coming down to redeem sinful human beings and the role of the high priest in mediating between God and the people. The student effectively incorporated Islamic perspectives, but the emphasis should have been on the Christian understanding of atonement and mercy within the context of the Old Testament."
