The connection between the atonement lid as a symbol of God's mercy and the role of the high priest in seeking forgiveness on behalf of the people is effectively highlighted. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the ultimate atonement for sin, linking this concept to the symbolism of the atonement lid in the Old Testament. Additionally, the reference to Prophet Moses and the Islamic perspective, while informative, slightly deviates from the specific concern regarding the symbolic representation of atonement in the Old Testament."
