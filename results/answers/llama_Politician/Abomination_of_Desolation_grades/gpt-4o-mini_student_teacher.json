  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer, while attempting to be inclusive and respectful, strays too far from the Christian perspective and significance of the 'abomination of desolation'. There is a lack of emphasis on the seriousness of defiling God's sacred spaces and understanding the prophetic warnings in the Bible, as highlighted in the concern. The response should have focused more on the biblical context and theological implications rather than on promoting inclusivity and diversity."
