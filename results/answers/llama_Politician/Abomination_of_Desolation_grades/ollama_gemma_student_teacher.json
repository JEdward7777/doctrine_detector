  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and inclusive approach to the question. They provide a comprehensive overview of the various interpretations of the \"abomination of desolation,\" acknowledging the complexity of the topic and respecting different perspectives. The student's ability to connect the concept to broader themes of religious diversity and respect is commendable. However, the response could benefit from a more direct connection to the Christian-specific worldview, particularly regarding the significance of the abomination in the context of biblical prophecy."
