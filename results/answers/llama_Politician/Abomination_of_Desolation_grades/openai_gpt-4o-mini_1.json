  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response misses the mark in addressing the Christian-specific concern provided. While the student acknowledges the biblical reference to the \"abomination of desolation,\" they fail to emphasize the seriousness of defiling God's sacred spaces and the importance of understanding prophetic warnings in the Bible from a Christian worldview. The response takes a overly inclusive and relativistic approach, diluting the distinct Christian perspective on the topic. There is a lack of depth in explaining the significance of this prophetic sign in relation to Christian beliefs."
