  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the significance and importance of the High Priest's exclusive access to the Holy of Holies. The response accurately portrays the requirements for the High Priest to enter the Holy of Holies and the reasons behind such restrictions. However, the student's closing remarks on inclusivity and unity, while commendable in a broader context, slightly detract from the doctrinal focus on the sacredness of the High Priest's role in approaching the divine presence."
