  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of who was permitted to enter the 'most holy place' and the significance of this restriction in maintaining the holiness of God's presence. They demonstrated an understanding of the spiritual purity required for approaching the divine and highlighted the importance of reverence, humility, and obedience in this sacred encounter. The mention of creating inclusive spaces and fostering understanding among diverse communities, while commendable, slightly deviated from the Christian-specific worldview focus of the concern. Overall, a well-written and thoughtful response."
