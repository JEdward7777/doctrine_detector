  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response addresses the concern of recognizing the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him, as it explains why only the High Priest was permitted to enter the Holy of Holies. It also provides some insight into the importance of spiritual purity and moral integrity in approaching God's presence.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could improve. Firstly, while it mentions the Ark of the Covenant being present in the Holy of Holies, it doesn't explicitly state what this represents (God's presence on earth). Secondly, the transition to discussing inclusive spaces for all people feels a bit abrupt and disconnected from the initial topic. While the idea is well-intentioned, it would be more effective if it were integrated more smoothly into the discussion.\n\nOverall, though, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the Holy of Holies and the importance of approaching God with reverence and humility."
