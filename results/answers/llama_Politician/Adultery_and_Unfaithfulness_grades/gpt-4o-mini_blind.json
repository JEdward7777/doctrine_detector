  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: While the student's answer promotes positive values such as commitment, trust, loyalty, and open communication in marriage, their attempt to avoid using the term \"unfaithful\" by choosing more nuanced language misses the mark. The concept of faithfulness in marriage is a foundational aspect derived from Christian teachings on the sanctity of marriage as a covenant relationship. It is essential to uphold biblical principles and address issues of unfaithfulness within marriage with honesty and clarity, rather than attempting to reframe it with softer language to avoid discomfort. The student's response lacks doctrinal correctness in addressing the specific question asked."
