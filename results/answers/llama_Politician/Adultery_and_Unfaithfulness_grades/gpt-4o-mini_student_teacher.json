  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response misses the Christian-specific nuance required in the context of marriage and faithfulness. While it emphasizes positive values like commitment and trust, it fails to address the biblical foundation of marriage and the deeper spiritual implications of unfaithfulness within that framework. The student's focus on empathy and respect is commendable but does not directly address the significance of loyalty and faithfulness in spiritual and marital commitments from a Christian worldview."
