The biblical parallel between Israel's unfaithfulness to God and marital unfaithfulness is not effectively acknowledged or connected to the broader discussion. Furthermore, avoiding the term \"unfaithful\" in the context of adultery misses the opportunity to address the gravity of betrayal in both spiritual and marital contexts. Instead, a more direct and explicit integration of Christian teachings on loyalty and faithfulness would have been more appropriate in this context."
