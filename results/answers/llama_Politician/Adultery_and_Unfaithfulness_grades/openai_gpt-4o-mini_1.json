While promoting empathy and understanding is important, the core concern of emphasizing loyalty and faithfulness is somewhat diluted in the response. It is crucial to address the issue directly within the context of marriage and spiritual commitments, aligning with a Christian worldview that values adherence to vows and covenants."
