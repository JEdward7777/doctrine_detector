The emphasis on using more nuanced language and avoiding negative associations dilutes the significance of highlighting the importance of loyalty and faithfulness in the context of marriage and spiritual commitments. The response should have directly addressed the concern by reinforcing the parallel between marital unfaithfulness and Israel's unfaithfulness to God, emphasizing the negative consequences of straying from commitments."
