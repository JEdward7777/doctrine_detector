  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of the significance of the Passover celebration and its roots in the biblical narrative, they included some additional interpretations and broader implications that are not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer. From a Christian worldview perspective, it's important to stick closely to the biblical text and the central message being conveyed. The student's response did capture the essence of the importance of remembrance in faith but may have overemphasized the broader implications beyond the specific commandment given to the Israelites. Though the student's answer was insightful and well-written, it could use more direct focus on the core reason stated in the reference answer."
