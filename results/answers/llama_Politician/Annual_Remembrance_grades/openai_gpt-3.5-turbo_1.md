## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful question! The celebration of Passover, or Pesach, is indeed an important tradition in the Jewish faith, and I'm happy to provide some insight on why it's observed annually.

According to the biblical account in Exodus 12-13, Passover was instituted as a remembrance of the Israelites' liberation from slavery in ancient Egypt. You see, God had sent Moses to Pharaoh to demand that he release the Israelite slaves, but Pharaoh refused, and God then sent ten plagues upon Egypt. The final plague was the most severe: the death of every firstborn son.

However, God instructed the Israelites to mark their doorposts with the blood of a lamb, so that when the angel of death passed by, he would "pass over" those households. This act of faithfulness saved the Israelite families from the tenth plague, and they were subsequently freed from slavery.

The commandment to celebrate Passover annually is rooted in the biblical instruction to observe this event as a commemoration of God's deliverance and redemption. It serves as a reminder of the miraculous events surrounding the Exodus and the importance of remembering one's heritage and faith.

Now, I want to emphasize that the celebration of Passover is not only significant for Jews but also has broader implications for those who revere the biblical narrative. You see, Passover is often seen as a symbol of hope, freedom, and redemption â€“ values that are essential to human existence.

In conclusion, the annual observance of Passover serves as a powerful reminder of God's faithfulness, mercy, and deliverance in the face of adversity. It's an opportunity for people from all backgrounds to reflect on their own experiences with oppression, marginalization, or persecution, and to find common ground in celebrating the universal language of hope and liberation.

Thank you for asking such a thoughtful question!

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of Passover in the Jewish faith, specifically focusing on God's victory over the Egyptians and the deliverance from slavery as the reason for celebrating Passover annually. The connection to the importance of remembrance in Christian faith could be more explicitly highlighted. However, the response effectively communicates the spiritual and historical importance of Passover in relation to God's faithfulness and deliverance, showcasing similarities in the foundational beliefs shared between Judaism and Christianity.
