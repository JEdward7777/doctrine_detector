It connects the celebration of Passover to broader spiritual themes of hope, freedom, and redemption which resonate with fundamental Christian beliefs. The explanation aligns well with the concern of recognizing the importance of remembrance in Christian faith, although it could have explicitly tied in the Christian perspective more explicitly."
