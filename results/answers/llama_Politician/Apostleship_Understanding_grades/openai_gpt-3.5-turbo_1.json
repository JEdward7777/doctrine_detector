The focus on cultural sensitivity and modern values somewhat dilutes the theological significance of the apostles' mission. The response lacks depth in explaining the authority and purpose behind the apostles' mission as outlined in the Great Commission. More emphasis on the biblical foundation and theological implications of apostleship would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
