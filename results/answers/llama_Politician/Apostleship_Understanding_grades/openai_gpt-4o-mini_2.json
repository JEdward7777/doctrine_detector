The focus on inclusivity, diversity, and tolerance detracts from the central message of preaching about God and his kingdom. The response lacks a robust exploration of the significance of apostleship in the early church's establishment and expansion. There is an emphasis on modern values and societal norms that, while important, do not directly address the concern regarding the role of apostleship in the Great Commission."
