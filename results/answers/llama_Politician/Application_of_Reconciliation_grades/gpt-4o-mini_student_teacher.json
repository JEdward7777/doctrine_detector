  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed answer outlining practical ways Christians can apply the principle of reconciliation in their relationships with others. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of reconciliation in daily life and offers valuable suggestions for implementation. However, the student's response could be improved by focusing more directly on the core principle of pursuing peace, restoring good relations, and forgiving others as taught in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to align their suggestions more closely with this foundational Christian principle would strengthen their overall response."
