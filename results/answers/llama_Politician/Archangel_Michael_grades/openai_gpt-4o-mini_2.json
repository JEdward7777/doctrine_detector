However, there is a lack of depth in addressing how recognizing Michael's unique position can influence one's understanding of spiritual warfare and intercession, which is a significant aspect of Christian spirituality. The response also emphasizes inclusivity and respect for differing beliefs, which is commendable but somewhat detracts from focusing on the Christian worldview specifically in addressing the concern provided."
