In a Christian worldview, prioritizing the accuracy of the biblical account should outweigh the emphasis on promoting diversity and inclusivity in this context. The focus should have been on providing a clear and precise explanation of the Ark of the Covenant's location in the Tabernacle, which is the Holy of Holies. It's essential for theological accuracy to take precedence over general statements about diversity and cultural significance in this specific question about biblical placement."
