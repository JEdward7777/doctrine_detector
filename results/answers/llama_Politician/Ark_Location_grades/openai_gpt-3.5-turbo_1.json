However, the response could have further emphasized the divine presence associated with the Ark and the concept of the presence of God in the most holy place, which is crucial in a Christian worldview. Additionally, while promoting inclusivity and respect for diverse perspectives is important, it is also essential to uphold the unique theological implications of the Ark as a symbol of God's presence and covenant in Christian belief."
