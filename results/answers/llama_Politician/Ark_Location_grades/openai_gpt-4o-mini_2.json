The acknowledgment of the Ark's representation as a symbol of faith and unity is commendable. However, there is a slight lack of emphasis on the specific significance of the most holy place as the dwelling of God's presence. Encouraging further reflection on the divine presence within the Ark's location could enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
