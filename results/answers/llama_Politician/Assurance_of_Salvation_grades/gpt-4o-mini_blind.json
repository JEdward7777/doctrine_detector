However, it lacks doctrinal clarity and specificity in articulating the core assurance that Christians believe in - salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The emphasis on respecting diverse beliefs and downplaying the uniqueness of Jesus as the sole source of salvation dilutes the central tenet of Christian faith. More emphasis on the foundational assurance of eternal life offered through Jesus would have strengthened the response."
