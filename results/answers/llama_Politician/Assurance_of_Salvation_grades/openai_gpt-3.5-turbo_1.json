Instead, it focuses on the general aspects of faith and the diversity of beliefs. While it emphasizes respecting individual beliefs and experiences, it lacks a clear affirmation of the central Christian belief in salvation through faith in Jesus. It is important to clearly articulate this foundational tenet of the Christian faith in order to provide the needed reassurance to believers."
