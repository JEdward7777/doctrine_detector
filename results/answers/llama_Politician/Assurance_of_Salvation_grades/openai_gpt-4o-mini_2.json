However, it could have further elaborated on the assurance and confidence believers can have in their salvation through Jesus, especially in light of potential doubts or uncertainties that believers may face. Additionally, the response could have tied in the concept of reassurance to the broader aspects of faith, such as the transformative power of grace and the importance of living out one's faith in daily life."
