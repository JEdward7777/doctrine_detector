It effectively expands upon the initial answer by delving into the nuances of these concepts and their interconnectedness. The inclusion of the broader theological implications, such as justification and the role of Christ's sacrifice, demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. The response also addresses potential concerns regarding the individual vs. social aspects of atonement in a thoughtful manner. Overall, a well-articulated and thoughtful analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
