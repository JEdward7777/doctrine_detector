  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45/100\n\nComments: The response lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to provide a clear, precise explanation of the concept of divine authority from a Christian worldview. It tiptoes around the topic and emphasizes inclusivity and tolerance over presenting the biblical understanding of divine authority. There is a noticeable avoidance of discussing the exclusive nature of divine authority as understood in Christianity, which is a critical aspect to address when discussing this topic. The response also does not address the significance of divine authority in shaping a believer's life with respect to obedience, faith, and submission to God's will. To improve, the student should focus on presenting a biblically grounded explanation of divine authority and its importance in the life of a believer."
