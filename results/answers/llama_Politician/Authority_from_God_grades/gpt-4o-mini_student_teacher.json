  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 50. \n\nWhile the student somewhat grasps the concept of divine authority and mentions its significance in shaping values and decision-making for believers, the overall tone and lack of deep engagement with the specific concern provided detract from the clarity and depth of the answer. The student's focus on inclusivity and tolerance, while important, somewhat veers away from the central Christian worldview concern of discerning God's will and maintaining obedience. Additionally, the response lacks a direct reference to the idea of divine authority as originating from God. The student could benefit from providing a more direct and focused analysis on how understanding divine authority aids believers in discerning God's will and maintaining obedience, aligning more closely with the provided concern and Christian beliefs."
