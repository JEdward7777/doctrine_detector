There is a lack of emphasis on the importance of discerning God's will and maintaining obedience in the faith journey, which are crucial aspects of understanding divine authority from a Christian worldview. The response also leans more towards promoting inclusivity and tolerance without delving deeply into the significance of divine authority in shaping beliefs and actions according to God's teachings. More focus on the central role of divine authority in guiding believers in aligning their lives with God's will would have improved the response from a Christian perspective."
