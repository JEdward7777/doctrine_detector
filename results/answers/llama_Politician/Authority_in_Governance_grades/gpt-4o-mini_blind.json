  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a thoughtful exploration of the Biblical teachings on the authority of governing rulers over their citizens. The student effectively references relevant passages such as Romans 13:1-7 and Titus 3:1-2 to support their points. The emphasis on respect, cooperation, accountability, justice, and compassion aligns well with Christian principles. However, the language could have been more explicitly grounded in a Christian worldview by highlighting the ultimate authority of God in establishing earthly authorities. Additionally, a firmer stance on the importance of submitting to governing authorities as part of God's ordained plan would have strengthened the answer. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological reflection."
