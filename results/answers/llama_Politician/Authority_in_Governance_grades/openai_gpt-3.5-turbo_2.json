  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response eloquently delves into the biblical passages of Romans 13:1-7 and Titus 3:1-2, demonstrating a deep understanding of the God-ordained structure of authority and the responsibility to obey. The candidate effectively emphasizes the importance of respect, cooperation, accountability, justice, and compassion within governance, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The only room for improvement would be to further elaborate on how these biblical principles specifically inform the candidate's policies and decision-making as a leader."
