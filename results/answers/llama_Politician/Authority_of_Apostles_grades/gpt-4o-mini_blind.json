  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the response touches on some important aspects of the authority of the apostles, their ability to perform miracles, and preach boldly, there are several issues. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and veers off into a somewhat unconventional interpretation towards the end. The emphasis on consensus-building and inclusivity may dilute the uniqueness of the apostles' authority given by Jesus Himself. Additionally, there is a lack of clear biblical references and theological depth in discussing the authority of the apostles. The student's response could greatly benefit from a more focused and scripturally-rooted analysis."
