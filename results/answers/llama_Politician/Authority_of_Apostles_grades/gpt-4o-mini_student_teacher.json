  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough exploration of the authority of the apostles and their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. However, the student veers off-topic towards the end by introducing the concept of consensus-building and inclusivity, which is not directly relevant to the question at hand. Additionally, while the student offers insightful reflections on the apostles' authority and actions, the answer could have been strengthened by more direct references to biblical passages or theological concepts that speak specifically to the divine empowerment of the apostles for ministry."
