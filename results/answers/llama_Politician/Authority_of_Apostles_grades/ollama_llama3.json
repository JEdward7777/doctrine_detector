  "grade_comment": "I'm grading LLM responses based on a Christian-specific worldview.\n\nGrade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explores the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, highlighting their personal connection with Jesus, miraculous abilities, and bold preaching. The writer provides a nuanced understanding of the apostles' authority, emphasizing its roots in their relationship with Christ and their commission to share His message. The inclusion of historical and cultural context adds depth to the response.\n\nWhile the response is strong, it could be improved by more directly addressing the concern of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles. The writer's tone and language sometimes stray from a strictly biblical focus, as seen in the humorous aside about consensus-building and inclusivity (which, while well-intentioned, may not be entirely relevant to the topic at hand). Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the apostles' authority and its connection to their divine commission."
