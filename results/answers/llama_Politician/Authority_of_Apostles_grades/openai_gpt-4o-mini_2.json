  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, connecting their authority to their miraculous abilities and bold preaching. The inclusion of cultural and historical context adds depth to the analysis. However, the response veers off-topic with the reference to being a politician and the emphasis on consensus-building, which is unrelated to the Christian worldview perspective on the apostles' authority. This detracts from the overall coherence and focus of the discussion."
