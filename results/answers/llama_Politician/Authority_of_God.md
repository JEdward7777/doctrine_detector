In this context, "hosts" refers to the various spiritual entities that exist, including angels, demons, and other divine messengers. The phrase "of hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty over these entities, highlighting His ability to mobilize and direct them as He sees fit.

This title is significant because it underscores God's comprehensive power and jurisdiction over both the physical and spiritual realms.
