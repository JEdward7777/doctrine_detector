  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and insightful explanation of the significance of the term \"Yahweh of Hosts\" in relation to God's authority over spiritual beings. They accurately convey the concept of God's sovereignty and power over the spiritual realm, emphasizing His role as the supreme ruler. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more specific references to relevant biblical passages or theological doctrines to support their points. Additionally, connecting the significance of this term to Christian theology specifically would enhance the response. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated, but there is room for deeper theological analysis."
