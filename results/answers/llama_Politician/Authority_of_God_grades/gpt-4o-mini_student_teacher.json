  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-detailed explanation of the term \"Yahweh of Hosts\" and its significance in highlighting God's authority over spiritual beings. The answer effectively conveyed the idea of God's sovereignty over both physical and spiritual realms. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern about how understanding God's authority deepens faith and trust in His omnipotence. Additionally, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher would have further strengthened the response."
