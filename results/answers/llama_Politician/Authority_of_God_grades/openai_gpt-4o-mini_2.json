It effectively connects the significance of this title to God's omnipotence and role as the supreme ruler. The understanding conveyed in the response can indeed deepen faith and trust in God's power. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a brief mention of how believers can personally apply this understanding of God's authority in their faith journey for practical application."
