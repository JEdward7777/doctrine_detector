However, the concern about understanding Jesus' authority helping believers acknowledge His sovereignty in their lives is not directly addressed. The response focuses more on inclusivity and interfaith understanding rather than specifically addressing believers' relationship with Jesus as King. While the perspective of inclusivity is valuable, a more direct connection to believers' acknowledgment of Jesus' authority in their lives would have strengthened the response."
