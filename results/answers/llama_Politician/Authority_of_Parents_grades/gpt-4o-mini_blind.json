The answer also falls short in not clearly affirming the traditional nuclear family structure as the ideal model for family dynamics according to Christian doctrine. The emphasis on cultural sensitivity and diversity, while important in some contexts, should not overshadow the foundational principles of parental authority as outlined in the Bible. The response could benefit from a stronger doctrinal focus and clearer alignment with Christian teachings on family structures and authority."
