  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response acknowledges the biblical basis for parental authority by referencing Ephesians 6:1-4, which is commendable. However, the student's answer lacks depth and specificity in discussing the Christian framework of obedience and authority within family dynamics. Additionally, the student's emphasis on cultural sensitivity and diversity, while important, detracts from the core biblical principles being addressed in the question. More focus on the biblical perspective and its application in Christian family dynamics would have strengthened the response."
