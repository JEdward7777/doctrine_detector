  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful reflection on parental authority within a Christian framework, referencing Ephesians 6:1-4 and acknowledging the complexities of biblical teachings on family dynamics. The candidate demonstrates an understanding of the importance of balancing obedience with cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. The emphasis on empathy, understanding, and mutual respect aligns well with Christian values of love and acceptance. However, there could have been a stronger integration of scriptural references throughout to emphasize the biblical foundation of parental authority within a Christian worldview. Overall, a solid response with room for further theological depth."
