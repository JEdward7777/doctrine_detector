The inclusion of cultural sensitivity and diversity is commendable; however, there could be more emphasis on the importance of maintaining a balance between obedience and authority as outlined in the concern. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian perspective on parental authority but could have delved deeper into addressing the specific concern raised."
