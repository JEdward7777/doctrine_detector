  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of key contributors to the Psalms, expanding on the mentioned figures with additional context. It acknowledges the uncertainty of authorship for some Psalms and emphasizes the importance of understanding the cultural context. The incorporation of respectful language and consideration for potential misinterpretations is commendable. However, the response could have further connected the authorship information to how it enhances the understanding of the Psalms' messages and themes more directly and explicitly."
