However, the suggestion to use alternative phrases like \"Messiah,\" \"Divine Human,\" or \"Embodiment of God's Love\" to describe Jesus as the \"Son of God\" does not accurately represent the Christian doctrine. In Christian theology, the term \"Son of God\" is central to understanding the relationship between Jesus and God the Father as part of the Holy Trinity. While it is important to be culturally sensitive, altering or substituting core theological concepts can risk diluting the essential teachings of Christianity. Additionally, the emphasis on prioritizing dialogue, empathy, and inclusivity should not come at the expense of compromising doctrinal accuracy."
