  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the complexities involved in language and cultural sensitivity. They acknowledge the potential for misunderstanding and respectfully suggest alternative phrases that could be used alongside \"Son of God\" to promote inclusivity. \n\nHowever, the student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on the importance of contextualizing and explaining the meaning of \"Son of God\" rather than simply avoiding it. This would align more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
