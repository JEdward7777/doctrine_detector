  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response acknowledges the potential for offense or confusion due to cultural differences, which aligns with the concern about avoidance leading to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings. It also suggests alternative phrases that could be used to convey the same meaning while being more culturally sensitive. This shows an understanding of the importance of inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly address the concern about avoiding the term \"Son of God\" altogether. Instead, it proposes using alternative phrases in addition to explaining the original term's meaning. While this approach is generally sound, it could be improved by more directly addressing the concern about avoidance.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the issue and offers some thoughtful suggestions for navigating it. With a bit more attention to explicitly addressing the concern, the score could be even higher."
