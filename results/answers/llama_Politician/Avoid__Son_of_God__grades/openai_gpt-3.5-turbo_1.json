However, it does not directly align with the given answer, which suggests that the term should be taught through context and explanation. While the response promotes understanding and respect for diverse beliefs, it could have connected more explicitly to the Christian worldview by emphasizing the significance of the term within Christian doctrine and the importance of teaching its meaning effectively."
