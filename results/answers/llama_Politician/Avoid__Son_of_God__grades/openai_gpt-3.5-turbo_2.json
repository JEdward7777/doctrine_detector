The suggestion to carefully teach the meaning of the term \"Son of God\" through context and explanation is in line with a Christian worldview that values clarity and understanding of foundational theological concepts. However, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the traditional terminology while simultaneously providing clarity and education to address potential confusion or offense in diverse cultural contexts."
