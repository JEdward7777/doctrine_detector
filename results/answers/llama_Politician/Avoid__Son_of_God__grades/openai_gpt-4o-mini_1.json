  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response shows thoughtful consideration of the concern raised, acknowledging the importance of teaching the meaning of the term \"Son of God\" rather than avoiding it altogether. However, the additional viewpoints presented regarding using alternative phrases to cater to diverse cultural backgrounds could potentially dilute the core Christian belief. Overall, the response demonstrates a balanced approach but could strengthen its argument by emphasizing the importance of clear teaching and contextualization of Christian concepts while respecting cultural differences."
