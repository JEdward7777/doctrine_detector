The use of relevant biblical references is commendable. However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the doctrinal significance and theological implications of each method of baptism, particularly in light of different Christian denominational beliefs. Additionally, the response could have further highlighted the importance of baptism as a public declaration of one's faith in Christ and participation in His death and resurrection. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological analysis."
