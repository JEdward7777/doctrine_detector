The inclusion of specific scriptural references adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of baptism within the Christian faith and how each method reflects different theological perspectives on the sacrament of baptism. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the overall significance of baptism in the context of salvation and the Christian life from a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
