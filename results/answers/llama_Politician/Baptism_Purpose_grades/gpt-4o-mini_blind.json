The emphasis on inclusivity and diversity, while important in certain contexts, detracts from the core theological significance of baptism. The response could have delved deeper into the biblical foundations of baptism as a symbol of repentance, forgiveness of sins, and identification with Christ's death and resurrection. Furthermore, it is crucial to emphasize the necessity of baptism for believers as a step of obedience and public declaration of faith. The response lacks clarity and conviction in presenting the Christian perspective on baptism, thereby reducing its doctrinal accuracy."
