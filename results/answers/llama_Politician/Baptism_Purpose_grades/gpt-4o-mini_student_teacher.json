  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-intentioned, does not directly address the significance of baptism according to New Testament teachings. The response focuses more on generic themes of inclusivity and diversity rather than the Christian understanding of baptism as a symbol of spiritual rebirth and union with Christ. In a Christian worldview, the core teaching of baptism as a cleansing from sin and unity with Christ is essential, and this was not adequately reflected in the student's answer."
