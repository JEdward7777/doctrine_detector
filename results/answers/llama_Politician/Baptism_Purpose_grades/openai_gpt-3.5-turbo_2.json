However, there is a lack of emphasis on the theological implications and spiritual significance of baptism within the Christian worldview. The response leans more towards general statements about inclusivity and diversity, which could be seen as diluting the specific Christian understanding of baptism. It touches on some relevant points but could benefit from a deeper exploration of the Christian perspective on baptism."
