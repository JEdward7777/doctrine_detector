However, there is a lack of emphasis on the core belief that baptism signifies cleansing from sin and union with Christ, which is a fundamental aspect of Christian doctrine. The response also overly focuses on inclusivity and diversity without adequately addressing the specific Christian perspective on baptism. More clarity and depth on the Christian understanding of baptism would have improved the response."
