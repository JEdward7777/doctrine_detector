  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While the response attempts to address the relationship between repentance and baptism, it falls short in accuracy and theological depth. The student mentions some relevant scriptures but fails to fully connect the concepts of repentance and baptism within the context of salvation and the Christian faith. The emphasis on inclusivity and downplaying the central importance of repentance and baptism in the Christian walk weakens the doctrinal clarity of the response. It is important for the student to prioritize conveying the core Christian beliefs on this topic."
