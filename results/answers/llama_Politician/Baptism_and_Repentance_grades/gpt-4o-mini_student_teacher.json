  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a somewhat convoluted and overly inclusive discussion on repentance and baptism in the New Testament, missing the core Christian doctrine relationship between the two. Their response lacks clarity and fails to align closely with the explicitly stated concern about the relationship between repentance and baptism. The answer would benefit from a more focused and concise explanation based on Christian teachings."
