The provided information does not strongly support the given answer that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism. The explanation tends to emphasize the symbolic and universal aspects of repentance and baptism, rather than focusing on the specific Christian doctrine regarding their relationship as outlined in the concern. Additional scriptural references and a clearer connection to Christian beliefs would strengthen the response."
