# Answer by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
A most excellent question! *ahem* I'm delighted to provide a thoughtful and inclusive response.

In the New Testament, repentance and baptism are indeed intertwined. You see, many scholars believe that when Jesus instructed his followers to "repent and be baptized" (Mark 1:15), he was emphasizing the importance of both spiritual transformation and ritual purification.

Repentance, in this context, likely referred to a profound change of heart and mind, marked by a commitment to leave one's sinful ways behind. It's essential to note that this understanding of repentance is not exclusive to any particular group or individual; rather, it's an invitation extended to all people.

Now, when we consider baptism as the act of immersion in water, some scholars see it as a symbol of washing away past sins and being reborn into a new life. This ritualistic aspect of baptism can be seen as a tangible expression of one's repentance, serving as a public declaration of their commitment to follow Jesus.

It's crucial to acknowledge that the New Testament accounts don't necessarily portray baptism as a requirement for salvation or even as a necessary precursor to receiving God's forgiveness. Instead, it seems to be more of a symbolic gesture, often tied to the larger narrative of Jesus' teachings and the early Christian community's practices.

In this vein, I'd like to emphasize that repentance and baptism are not exclusive to any specific cultural, religious, or socio-economic background. Rather, they're universal invitations extended to all people, regardless of their individual circumstances. *smiling warmly*

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to attend to some pressing matters in the realm of interfaith dialogue...

Comment: While the response offers a detailed exploration of repentance and baptism in the New Testament, it falls short in directly addressing the concern at hand. The provided information does not strongly support the given answer that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism. The explanation tends to emphasize the symbolic and universal aspects of repentance and baptism, rather than focusing on the specific Christian doctrine regarding their relationship as outlined in the concern. Additional scriptural references and a clearer connection to Christian beliefs would strengthen the response.
