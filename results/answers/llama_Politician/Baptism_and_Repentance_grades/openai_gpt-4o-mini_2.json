The connection between repentance and baptism is explored to some extent, but a more focused and thorough analysis rooted in Christian theology would have strengthened the response. Additionally, the emphasis on inclusivity and universal invitations, while positive, somewhat dilutes the specific Christian perspective on the significance of repentance as a prerequisite for baptism."
