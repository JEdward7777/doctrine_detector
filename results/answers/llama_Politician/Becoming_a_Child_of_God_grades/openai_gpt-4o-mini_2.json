The response seems to veer off into a more general discussion on spirituality and inclusivity, rather than directly addressing the Christian-specific concept of believing in Jesus as God the Son and becoming a child of God the Father. It is important to center the discussion around the core beliefs of Christianity when addressing questions of this nature."
