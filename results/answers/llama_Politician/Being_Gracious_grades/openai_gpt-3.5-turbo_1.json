The Christian worldview teaches that forgiveness and kindness are not just social niceties, but essential aspects of following Christ's example and commandments. Encouraging graciousness in daily interactions is commendable, but connecting it explicitly to the Christian faith and the teachings of Jesus Christ would have strengthened the response."
