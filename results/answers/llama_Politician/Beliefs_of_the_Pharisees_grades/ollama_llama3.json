  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThis response generally aligns with the provided answer, mentioning the Pharisees' beliefs in life after death and spiritual beings. It also explores the significance of these beliefs within Jewish tradition, which is relevant to understanding the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time (the specified concern). The discussion is well-organized and nuanced, acknowledging the limitations of reconstructing Pharisaic views through later traditions.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response does not explicitly state that the Pharisees believed in life after death as a realm where souls would be judged based on their actions during life. This detail is present in the original text but not fully captured in this response. Additionally, while the concern about exploring Pharisaic beliefs for understanding Jesus' time is implicit throughout the discussion, it could be more explicitly addressed to tie everything together.\n\nOverall, the response provides a thoughtful and informative exploration of Pharisaic beliefs, but could be more comprehensive and directly address the specified concern."
