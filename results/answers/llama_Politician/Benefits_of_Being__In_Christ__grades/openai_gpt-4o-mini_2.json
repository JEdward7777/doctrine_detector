The concepts mentioned are relevant in a general sense, but do not provide a deep dive into the specific practical implications of having a relationship with Christ as the core focus. The response could have been stronger by directly addressing how knowing Christ as Savior impacts daily living, decision-making, relationships, and overall lifestyle from a Christian worldview perspective."
