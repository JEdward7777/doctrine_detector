The incorporation of additional scripture passages beyond those mentioned in the initial answer enriches the response and deepens the theological discussion. The application of these verses to practical examples and the emphasis on forgiveness as a reflection of God's character are commendable. Overall, a strong and comprehensive analysis with solid scriptural backing. Great job!"
