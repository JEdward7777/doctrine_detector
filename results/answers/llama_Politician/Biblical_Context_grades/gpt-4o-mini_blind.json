  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The answer provides a general overview of the responsibilities of deacons, highlighting the importance of serving others and embodying qualities such as humility and integrity. However, the response lacks depth and precision in explaining the specific duties and qualifications outlined in the New Testament regarding deacons, as seen in Acts 6:1-6 and 1 Timothy 3:8-13. The use of informal language and personal reflections detracts from a more focused and doctrinally accurate explanation. To improve, the student should delve deeper into the biblical passages and clearly articulate the scriptural requirements and functions of deacons within the Christian community."
