  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and enthusiastic response about the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, emphasizing the importance of serving others and the qualities required for the role. However, the student did not directly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as specified. The reference answer explicitly mentions the distribution of resources to widows, which aligns with the concern provided. The student's answer was well-written and demonstrated a good understanding of the role of deacons but missed the specific focus on fair treatment and care within the church community."
