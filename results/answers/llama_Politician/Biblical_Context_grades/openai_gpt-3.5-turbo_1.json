  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and well-structured explanation of the role of deacons, drawing from biblical passages. However, it focuses more on the general responsibilities and qualities of deacons rather than specifically addressing the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as mentioned in the answer provided. The response could have been strengthened by directly linking the responsibilities of deacons to the specific concern raised."
