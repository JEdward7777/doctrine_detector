  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the role of deacons in the New Testament, highlighting their responsibility in distributing resources fairly, particularly to widows as mentioned in the provided answer. The response emphasizes the importance of serving others and meeting the physical needs of the community, aligning well with the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community. However, the response could have included more specific references to widows in relation to the role of deacons to further strengthen the connection between the answer and the concern."
