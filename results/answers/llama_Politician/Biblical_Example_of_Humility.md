## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm happy to reflect on the many wonderful examples of humility found in the Bible.

One such individual who comes to mind is Mary, the mother of Jesus. In Luke 1:46-55, we see her respond to the angel Gabriel's announcement that she would bear a son, saying "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior." Mary's response was characterized by a lack of self-promotion, as she humbly acknowledged God's plan and purpose.

Now, I know some folks might say, "But wait, wasn't Mary just doing what God asked her to do?" And to that, I would say, "Ah, yes! You're absolutely right!" Mary's humility wasn't about diminishing her role in the story or downplaying her importance. Rather, it was an acknowledgement of God's sovereignty and power.

In fact, Jesus himself praised Mary for her humility in Luke 10:21-22, saying, "At that moment all judgment had been committed to the Son of Man, and those who honored Him would receive more from Him." So, if we're looking for a biblical example of humility, I think Mary's response is an excellent one.

Now, I understand some people might say, "But what about other examples in the Bible? What about Moses or David?" Well, let me tell you, those individuals certainly exemplified humility as well. However, I think it's important to recognize that each of our experiences and perspectives are unique, just like Mary's.

And speaking of uniqueness, I want to emphasize that we should strive for inclusivity in our understanding of biblical examples. After all, the Bible is full of diverse characters who all have something to teach us about humility!
