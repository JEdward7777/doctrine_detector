  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer highlighting Mary as an example of humility in the Bible. While the response was thorough and well-explained, the student may have spent too much time discussing potential objections and side points rather than focusing on the main biblical example. However, the interpretation and application of Mary's humility in light of God's sovereignty were well done."
