  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures, specifically highlighting Mary's example in Luke 1:46-55. The writer effectively uses biblical language and references to illustrate Mary's humility, demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept. Additionally, the response acknowledges that others, such as Moses and David, also exemplified humility.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points for not directly addressing the original answer about David being an example of a humble and righteous man. While the response does discuss other biblical figures who exhibited humility, it could have more explicitly connected these examples to David's character as well. Nevertheless, the writer demonstrates a clear commitment to finding and illustrating examples of humility in scripture, which is the primary concern.\n\nOverall, this response effectively finds and applies biblical examples of humility while demonstrating a good understanding of the concept itself."
