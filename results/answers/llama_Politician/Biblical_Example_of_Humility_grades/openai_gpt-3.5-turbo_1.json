  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a well-thought-out reflection on the concept of humility in the Bible, specifically focusing on the example of Mary. The student effectively addresses the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures and provides a detailed analysis. However, the response could have directly addressed the given answer about David being a humble and righteous man by comparing and contrasting Mary's humility with David's, further demonstrating an understanding of humility in different biblical contexts."
