The discussion is well-supported with relevant biblical references and demonstrates an understanding of humility as acknowledging God's sovereignty. However, the response could have directly addressed the concern by providing more specific examples of humility from the scriptures. Additionally, while the response discusses Mary's humility effectively, it could have also incorporated the example of David to further strengthen the analysis."
