  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful reflection on the biblical example of Mary's humility, tying it back to the specified concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. The candidate effectively explores Mary's humility in response to God's plan and emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty and power. However, while the response expands on Mary's humility, it could have included a more direct comparison or contrast with David as the given answer, which would have strengthened the overall analysis. Additionally, the candidate's discussion of inclusivity in understanding biblical examples slightly deviates from the primary concern of finding specific examples of humility. Overall, a solid reflection, but could have further connected Mary's example to the given answer for a more cohesive analysis."
