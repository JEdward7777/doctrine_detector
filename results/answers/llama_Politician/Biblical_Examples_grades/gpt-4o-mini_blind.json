  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: This response provides a good overview of Job and Noah as biblical figures considered blameless. The student effectively captures key aspects of their stories and draws meaningful lessons for readers to emulate. However, the response could benefit from incorporating specific biblical references to support the points made. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of God's grace in enabling blameless living would further enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological exploration."
