  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible passages that demonstrate God's blessings on creation, although there was unnecessary hesitation and a lack of confidence in presenting the information. The explanation regarding human dominion over creation was somewhat hesitant and could have been more confidently addressed from a Christian worldview perspective. The student also introduced some potentially controversial perspectives on the interpretation of God's blessings on creation, which could confuse or mislead readers. More assertiveness and doctrinal clarity would improve the grade."
