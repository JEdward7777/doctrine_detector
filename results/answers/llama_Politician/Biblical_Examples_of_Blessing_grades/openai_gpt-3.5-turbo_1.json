The inclusion of verses from Genesis, Psalms, and connecting the concept of blessings with human responsibility towards the environment demonstrates a good understanding of how blessings are illustrated in scripture. The response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the given concern in a more focused manner rather than delving into a broader discussion about humanity's relationship with nature."
