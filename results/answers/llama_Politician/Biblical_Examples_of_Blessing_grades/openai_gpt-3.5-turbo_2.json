However, there is potential concern with the interpretation of human dominion over creation being presented as complex and multifaceted, which may not fully align with a Christian worldview emphasizing stewardship and care for God's creation. A more explicit emphasis on the stewardship aspect and God's ultimate ownership of creation would have strengthened the response."
