  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response is well-intentioned and respectful, but it lacks focus on specific examples from Scripture that illustrate Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. While the student attempts to discuss the nuances of Jesus' trial and the importance of empathy, the response strays too far from addressing the question directly. There is a need for more direct referencing of biblical passages to support the argument about Jesus' innocence, as per the concern provided."
