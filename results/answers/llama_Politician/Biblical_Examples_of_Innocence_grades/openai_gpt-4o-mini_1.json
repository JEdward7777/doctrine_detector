  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the topic and effectively ties in key moments from the New Testament to affirm Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. The student contextualizes the examples within a broader discussion that reflects empathy, understanding, and the value of seeking truth. The integration of multiple perspectives and the emphasis on compassion align well with a Christian worldview. The response could benefit from a more direct connection to the specified examples, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
