  "grade_comment": "Grade: 72\n\nComment: The response addresses the concern by discussing key moments in the New Testament that affirm Jesus' innocence, such as the acknowledgment by others of his innocence. The candidate also demonstrates empathy and understanding in approaching the topic, which is commendable. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of Jesus' innocence and the implications for Christian belief. Additionally, there is room for improvement in connecting the examples provided in the answer more directly to the concern raised. Further scriptural references and a clearer tie-in to Christian doctrine would have strengthened the response."
