  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The response lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to give appropriate reverence to the Biblical figures mentioned. The overly casual tone and attempts to be politically correct detract from the seriousness of the topic. The response also misses key aspects of lament, such as the deep emotional expressions and raw honesty seen in figures like Job, David, and Jesus. A more reverent and doctrinally sound exploration of lament in the Bible would improve the grade significantly."
