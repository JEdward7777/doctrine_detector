  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: While the response touches on key examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy, it lacks doctrinal clarity and depth. The student's answer dances around the biblical narratives without delving into their theological significance with firm conviction. Encouragement to strengthen the response would include explicitly stating the biblical references, emphasizing God's intrinsic nature of mercy, and highlighting the transformative power of mercy in the lives of individuals. An improvement in theological precision and boldness would enhance the overall articulation of the concept of mercy from a biblical perspective."
