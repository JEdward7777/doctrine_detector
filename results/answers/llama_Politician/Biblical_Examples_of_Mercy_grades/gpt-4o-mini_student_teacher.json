  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks depth and focus on the biblical examples illustrating mercy. While they attempted to address the concept of mercy with the stories of the prodigal son, the woman at the well, and the healing of the blind man, their explanations were vague and lacked scriptural references. Additionally, their response seemed more focused on general statements about mercy rather than providing specific examples from the Bible. The student's answer could be improved by incorporating direct scriptural references and delving deeper into the significance of mercy in the context of these biblical narratives."
