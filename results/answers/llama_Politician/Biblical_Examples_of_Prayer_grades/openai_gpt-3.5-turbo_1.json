However, the initial response also emphasizes inclusivity and respect for all individuals, which is important but somewhat deviates from the specific concern of focusing on biblical stories. While inclusivity and respect are valuable principles, a stronger focus on the biblical examples and their practical applications for prayer life would have been more appropriate in this context from a Christian worldview perspective."
