However, there is a lack of explicit connection to the significance of inclusivity or respect for diverse beliefs within the context of prayer in the Bible from a Christian worldview. Encouraging respect and understanding is important, but in this specific context, the focus should have been more directly on the impact of biblical stories on prayer life."
