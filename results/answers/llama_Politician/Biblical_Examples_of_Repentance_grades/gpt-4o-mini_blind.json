However, the response lacks doctrinal specificity and fails to emphasize the foundational Christian belief that repentance is necessary for salvation. The student should incorporate more theological depth and scriptural references to support their points. Additionally, while sensitivity and respect for other faith traditions are important, the focus should primarily be on presenting repentance within a Christian framework."
