  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The response provides a good overview of the concept of transgression in the Bible, citing relevant passages such as Genesis 3, Leviticus 18, and Psalm 51. The student's explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the biblical context. However, the answer could be strengthened by emphasizing the theological significance of transgression in terms of sin and disobedience against God's commands. Additionally, connecting the concept of transgression to the need for repentance and God's grace could enhance the theological depth of the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for further theological insight."
