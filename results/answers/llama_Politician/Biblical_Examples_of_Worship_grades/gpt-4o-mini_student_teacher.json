  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-written response, showing a good understanding of the importance of avoiding idolatry in worship. The student correctly identified an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship, referencing the story of the golden calf in Exodus. However, the student could have directly referenced the specific Bible verse provided in the teacher's answer, Exodus 20:3, to make their answer more precise. Additionally, the student's response could have included more direct quotes from the Bible to strengthen their argument. Overall, a solid effort but could have been more focused on the specific example provided in the teacher's answer."
