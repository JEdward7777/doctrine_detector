  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the biblical distinction between true worship and idolatry, emphasizing the importance of remaining faithful to God's commands.

The only minor suggestion would be to explicitly link the response back to the original concern earlier in the explanation for greater coherence."
