I'm glad you asked that question, my fellow citizen of this great nation! As we strive for inclusivity and respect for all faiths and belief systems, I must acknowledge that Jesus' directives to his apostles are an important part of many people's spiritual journeys.

According to the Gospels, Jesus gave his apostles a very clear directive regarding the good news. In Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:15-18, Luke 24:46-48, and John 20:21-23, we read that Jesus instructed his followers to go forth and spread the message of love, compassion, and redemption.

Specifically, Jesus told them to:

* Make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19)
* Preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15)
* Teach people to obey everything Jesus has commanded (Matthew 28:20)
* Be witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea, Samaria, and even to the ends of the earth (Acts 1:8)

Now, I know that not everyone may identify with this specific faith tradition. And that's perfectly okay! As a politician, my role is to respect and celebrate our diversity, while also working towards common goals and values.

So, let me ask you, how do we, as a society, continue to spread the message of love, compassion, and redemption in our own unique ways? How can we work together to build bridges between different cultures, faiths, and backgrounds?

Let's have an open and respectful conversation about this!
