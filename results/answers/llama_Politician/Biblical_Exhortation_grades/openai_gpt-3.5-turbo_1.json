The response appropriately integrates the Christian worldview into the discussion on faith and inclusivity in a political setting. However, there could have been a more explicit emphasis on the unique and central role evangelism plays in Christianity, perhaps by highlighting the urgency and significance of sharing the message of salvation with others."
