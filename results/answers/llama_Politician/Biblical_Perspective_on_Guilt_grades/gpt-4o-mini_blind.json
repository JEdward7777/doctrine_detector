  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student demonstrates a good understanding of the connection between guilt and sin in the Bible and highlights the importance of repentance and forgiveness through Jesus Christ, the response meanders a bit too much into general philosophical and societal perspectives rather than focusing solely on the biblical illustration of consequences related to guilt and sin. There is also a lack of specific scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, the answer could benefit from a more focused and scripturally grounded approach."
