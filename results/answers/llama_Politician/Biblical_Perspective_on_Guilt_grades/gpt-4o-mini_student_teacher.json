  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student demonstrated a good understanding of how guilt and sin are intertwined in the Bible, their answer strayed off topic and became overly verbose. The answer could have been more focused on providing specific biblical examples like the reference answer did. There was also a lack of emphasis on the gravity of sin and its consequences, which is essential to fully grasp the significance of God's grace and mercy. Overall, the student's response showed knowledge but lacked conciseness and direct application of the concern provided."
