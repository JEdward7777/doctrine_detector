The answer emphasizes inclusivity and sensitivity towards diverse perspectives, which is important in some contexts but detracts from emphasizing the supremacy of God's majesty as revealed in the Bible. It would have been more effective to focus on the doctrinal aspects of God's majesty in the verses provided and to highlight the unique characteristics of the Christian understanding of God's grandeur and splendor."
