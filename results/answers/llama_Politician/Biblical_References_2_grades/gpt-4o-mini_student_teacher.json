  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided an insightful exploration of the concept of God's majesty using biblical passages such as Psalm 104 and Isaiah 40. However, there was a missed opportunity to directly connect these passages with a deeper understanding of God's majestic nature. The student could have strengthened their response by delving into the specific attributes of God's majesty highlighted in the verses given by the teacher. Encouraging inclusivity and respect is commendable, but a more focused analysis of the biblical passages in light of God's majestic nature would have enhanced the answer."
