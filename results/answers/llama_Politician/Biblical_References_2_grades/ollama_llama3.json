  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60%\n\nComment: The response provides some biblical references that describe God's majesty, but it falls short of fully connecting these scriptures with an understanding of God's majestic nature as specified in the concern. While the response does mention specific passages and verses from Psalms and Isaiah, it does not adequately explore or explain how these texts illustrate God's majesty. Additionally, the response does not incorporate the given Bible references (2 Peter 1:16-18, Daniel 4:36, Isaiah 2:10, Jude 1:25, and Micah 5:4) that were provided as a correct answer. The response would be stronger if it focused more on how the scriptures cited illustrate God's majesty and incorporated the given Bible references to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this concept."
