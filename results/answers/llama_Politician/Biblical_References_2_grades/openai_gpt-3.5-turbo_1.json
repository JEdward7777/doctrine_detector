  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful discussion on the concept of God's majesty, drawing upon biblical passages and emphasizing inclusivity. However, while the student mentions relevant Bible verses, they do not adequately connect them with the understanding of God's majestic nature as requested in the concern. The response lacks depth in exploring the significance of the verses provided in illustrating God's majesty, resulting in a lower grade."
