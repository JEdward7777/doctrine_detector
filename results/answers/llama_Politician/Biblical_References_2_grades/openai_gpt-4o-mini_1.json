  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response beautifully discusses the concept of God's majesty with respect and inclusivity, citing relevant biblical passages such as Psalm 104 and Isaiah 40. However, the actual Bible references listed in the given answer are not directly incorporated into the response. It would have been stronger if the response had connected the specific scriptures provided with the discussion on God's majestic nature. Overall, the response shows depth and understanding on the topic but could have been enhanced by directly integrating the specific references into the discussion."
