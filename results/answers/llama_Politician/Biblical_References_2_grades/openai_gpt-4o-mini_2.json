  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provided a thoughtful exploration of the concept of God's majesty by referencing relevant biblical passages and emphasizing respect for diverse perspectives. The answer effectively connected scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature by citing appropriate verses. However, there could have been a stronger integration of the specific Bible references mentioned in the answer within the response to further enhance the exploration of God's majesty. The response demonstrated a good effort in addressing the concern, but there is room for improvement in directly incorporating the specified Bible verses into the discussion."
