A wonderful question, my friend! *adjusts tie*

As we explore the concept of the "Son of Man" in the Old Testament, I must emphasize that it's essential to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for all faith traditions. After all, our goal is to foster greater understanding and dialogue between people of diverse backgrounds.

Now, if you permit me, I'd like to highlight a few key passages that contribute to our comprehension of the "Son of Man" as a harbinger of the Messiah:

1. Ezekiel 2:1-3 - This prophetic vision emphasizes the divine commissioning of the Son of Man, who is entrusted with carrying God's message to His people.
2. Daniel 7:13-14 - The apocalyptic vision in Daniel speaks of the "Son of Man" as one who will receive eternal dominion and be given authority over all nations.
3. Psalm 8:4-6 - Although not explicitly titled "Son of Man," this psalm describes humanity's connection to God, which is later applied to Jesus Christ, often referred to as the Son of Man.

Please note that these references, in conjunction with other biblical passages, inform our understanding of Jesus' identity as the Messiah. However, I must stress that we should approach this topic with humility and a willingness to listen to diverse perspectives.

By exploring these Old Testament references, we can foster greater unity among people of faith, recognizing that our shared human experience is rooted in a common Creator. *smiles warmly*
