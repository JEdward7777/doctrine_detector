The selection of Old Testament references, such as Ezekiel 2:1-3, Daniel 7:13-14, and Psalm 8:4-6, was appropriate in highlighting key passages that contribute to the understanding of the \"Son of Man.\" However, the emphasis on fostering unity and diverse perspectives, while commendable, somewhat diluted the focus on doctrinal clarity and specificity in a Christian worldview. Encouraging humility and listening to diverse perspectives is important, but in theological discussions, it is crucial to anchor interpretations in the Scriptures and the revealed truth about Jesus as the Messiah. The response could have further deepened the exploration of how these Old Testament prophecies specifically point to Jesus as the fulfillment of Messianic expectations."
