  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thoughtful and respectful exploration of the concept of the \"Son of Man\" in the Old Testament, highlighting relevant passages and emphasizing the importance of approaching the topic with sensitivity. However, the answer lacks depth compared to the reference answer provided by the teacher. For a higher grade, the student could have delved deeper into the specific theological implications of the referenced passages in relation to Jesus' messianic role as the 'Son of Man.'"
