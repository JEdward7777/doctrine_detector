  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful exploration of key Old Testament references, specifically referencing Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel, to illustrate how the concept of the \"Son of Man\" informs Jesus' messianic role in the New Testament. The analysis is thorough and demonstrates a clear understanding of how these references connect to Jesus Christ. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more direct Scriptural quotations or citations to strengthen the argument further. Overall, a strong and well-articulated response from a Christian worldview perspective."
