The inclusion of specific biblical passages such as Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel enhances the discussion, demonstrating a solid grasp of the topic from a Christian worldview. The response could be further strengthened by directly connecting these Old Testament references to how they shape the perception of Jesus as the \"Son of Man\" in the New Testament."
