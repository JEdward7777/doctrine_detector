  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. \n\nThe student provided several relevant biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God from both the Old and New Testaments. They demonstrated an understanding of the significance of addressing God as Lord and how it reflects His authority and sovereignty. However, the student missed referencing the specific biblical passages mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. By incorporating those examples, the student's response would have aligned more closely with the given concern and shown a deeper engagement with the question."
