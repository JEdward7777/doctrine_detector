The examples provided are relevant and clearly illustrate the different ways the term \"Lord\" is used in the Christian Bible to convey concepts of authority, divinity, and sovereignty. However, the response could benefit from including additional passages from the Old Testament and highlighting the connection between the concept of \"Lord\" and the idea of acknowledging God's authority and importance."
