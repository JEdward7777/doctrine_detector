  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant biblical examples to support the concept of God being referred to as \"Lord\", but it could be more comprehensive and specific in its references. While the provided examples are not entirely incorrect, they do not accurately represent the majority of instances where \"Lord\" is used in the Bible. For instance, Psalm 86:15-17 does not explicitly use the term \"Lord\" to refer to God's authority or divinity. The response could benefit from more precise and detailed biblical references to reinforce its claims.\n\nThe concern about recognizing biblical references being important for understanding God's authority and acknowledging Him as Lord is partially addressed in the response, but it could be further emphasized and developed. A more comprehensive and accurate exploration of biblical examples would strengthen the argument and better support the concern."
