## [Answer](../Biblical_References_4.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
As a person of faith, I believe it's essential to respect the various ways people refer to their higher power. When we're talking about the Christian Bible, there are several instances where "Lord" is used to address God. Here are some examples:

1. In Psalm 33:12, it says, "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord." Here, the Psalmist is acknowledging God's sovereignty and blessings.

2. The book of Isaiah contains many passages that use "Lord" to describe God's power and wisdom. For example, in Isaiah 9:6, we read, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The holy, The [Lord] of hosts."

3. In the New Testament, Jesus often referred to God as his Father in heaven or my Lord. For instance, in Matthew 6:9, he taught his followers to pray, "Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, in earth, as it is in heaven." Similarly, in Luke 2:29, Simeon prayed, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word."

4. The apostle Paul also used the term "Lord" when addressing God or Jesus Christ. For instance, in Acts 7:48, he said, "Howbeit then, when the Gentiles received him, that they might believe all that was spoken by Moses; and when they had glorified God, they returned to Jerusalem with joy: and were received by the [Lord] with the twelve."
