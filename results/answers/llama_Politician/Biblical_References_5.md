## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm glad you asked! (clears throat) You see, I believe it's essential to approach this question in a way that is respectful to all faith traditions and cultures.

Now, regarding your inquiry, I would like to highlight the importance of understanding the context of Jesus' time. During His ministry, Jesus observed the Passover tradition, which included the consumption of unleavened bread, also known as matzoh. This act held significant spiritual meaning for the Jewish community at that time.

The relevant New Testament scripture that connects this concept to Christian teachings is likely 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, which states:

"Clean out the old yeast so you may be a new batch without yeast - as you really are. For indeed Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed."

Here, the apostle Paul draws parallels between the Jewish tradition of celebrating the Exodus and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on behalf of humanity. By using the imagery of unleavened bread and the Passover, Paul is emphasizing the significance of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection as a symbol of redemption.

In this context, I believe it's crucial to acknowledge that our understanding of scripture should be informed by both historical and cultural perspectives, while also respecting the diversity of faith experiences within the Christian community. (smiling warmly)
