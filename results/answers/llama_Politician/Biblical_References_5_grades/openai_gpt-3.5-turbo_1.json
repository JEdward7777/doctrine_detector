It effectively addresses the concern by identifying a relevant biblical text that sheds light on Christian practices. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of unleavened bread in relation to sin and purity within the context of the Passover tradition and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Additionally, integrating a stronger emphasis on the uniqueness of Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb could have enhanced the Christian worldview perspective."
