  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively identifies a relevant biblical text, 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, that connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings. It explains the significance of this connection in relation to Jesus Christ as the Passover lamb and the symbolism of redemption. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of how biblical texts inform Christian practices. However, the emphasis on respecting diversity in faith experiences, while important, could have been tied more directly to the biblical text discussed."
