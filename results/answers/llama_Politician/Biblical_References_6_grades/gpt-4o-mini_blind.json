  "grade_comment": "Grade: 88\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid response by referencing relevant Bible verses that speak to the concept of resurrection. The inclusion of key passages from different books of the Bible demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the response could have been improved by providing more in-depth analysis or interpretations of the verses to enhance the insight offered. Additionally, while the tone of the answer is respectful and inclusive, there was an opportunity to incorporate a more explicitly Christian worldview perspective in discussing the significance of the resurrection in the context of Christian beliefs."
