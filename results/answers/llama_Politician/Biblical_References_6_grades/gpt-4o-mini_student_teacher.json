  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a strong effort in exploring relevant Bible verses that provide insight into the concept of resurrection. The student effectively referenced specific passages and provided explanations for each, showcasing a good understanding of the topic. However, the student could improve by directly including the verses mentioned in the teacher's reference answer for a more concise and focused response. Additionally, while the student's inclusion of passages from the King James Version is noted, a broader acknowledgment of various translations could enhance the depth of analysis. Overall, a well-researched and informative response deserving of a solid grade."
