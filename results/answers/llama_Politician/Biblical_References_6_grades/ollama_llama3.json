  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of focusing on scripture, which addresses the primary concern. The writer provides a comprehensive overview of various biblical passages that discuss resurrection and eternal life, including John 11:25-26, Matthew 27:52-53, Luke 14:14-15, 1 Corinthians 15:51-52, and Revelation 20:11-15. This level of detail and inclusion of different perspectives is impressive.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not directly address the specific Bible verses mentioned in the original answer (1 Corinthians 15:13, 1 Peter 3:21, Hebrews 11:35, John 5:28-29, Luke 20:27). While the writer's selection of passages is relevant to the topic, they do not specifically engage with the original verses.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a strong commitment to scripture and provides valuable insights into the concept of resurrection. With a bit more attention to specific Bible verses, it could be even stronger."
