  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of biblical scriptures related to the concept of resurrection, referencing authoritative texts such as John, Matthew, Luke, 1 Corinthians, and Revelation. The discussion is well-supported and aligns with the concern of focusing on scriptural grounds for Christian beliefs. While the response could have incorporated the additional verses provided in the original answer to further enrich the analysis, overall, it effectively engages with the Christian worldview through scriptural exploration."
