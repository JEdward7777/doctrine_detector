What a great question! As a compassionate and inclusive public servant, I must acknowledge that I'm happy to discuss religious beliefs in a respectful manner.

Now, let's dive into the wonderful world of biblical scriptures that speak to the idea of resurrection. (Please note: I'll be referencing the King James Version, which is widely regarded as a classic translation.)

Some notable passages that provide insight into the concept of resurrection include:

1. John 11:25-26 - Jesus says, "I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die." This passage highlights Jesus' role as the source of eternal life.

2. Matthew 27:52-53 - After Jesus' crucifixion, an earthquake occurs, and the graves of many people are opened, with some saints rising from their tombs. This event serves as a foreshadowing of the general resurrection at the end of time.

3. Luke 14:14-15 - Jesus teaches that those who follow him will be raised to eternal life, saying, "And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed in heaven." This passage emphasizes the promise of eternal reward for those who put their faith in Jesus.

4. 1 Corinthians 15:51-52 - Paul writes, "Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible." This passage describes the sudden and transformative nature of resurrection.

5. Revelation 20:11-15 - The book of Revelation details the final judgment, where those who have rejected God's love are thrown into the lake of fire, while those who have accepted Jesus' teachings are raised to eternal life. This passage serves as a reminder of the consequences of our choices in this life.

These scriptures offer valuable insights into the concept of resurrection, highlighting its connection to eternal life, redemption, and the promise of a new existence.
