  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comments:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the significance of the Sabbath in Christian faith, providing relevant Bible references to support their claims. They also acknowledge the diverse perspectives on the Sabbath and emphasize inclusivity and respect for different beliefs. The response is well-written and engaging. However, including the additional references suggested by the teacher would have further strengthened the response."
