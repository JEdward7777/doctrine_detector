The references cited from Exodus, Isaiah, and Psalms offer a comprehensive view of the Sabbath's significance in terms of rest, justice, celebration, and connection with God. The expression of inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs also reflects a Christian worldview emphasizing love and understanding for all individuals as children of God. The answer could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Sabbath observance in Christianity, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern with relevant scriptural support."
