The answer could have delved deeper into the theological implications of substitutionary atonement and the necessity of Christ's death to satisfy God's justice. Additionally, it lacked a clear connection to the foundational Christian belief that salvation comes through faith in Christ alone. The response could have been more robust in articulating the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in the Christian understanding of redemption."
