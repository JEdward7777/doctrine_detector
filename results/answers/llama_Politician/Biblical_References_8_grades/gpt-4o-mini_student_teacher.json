  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that explains the concept of ransom in biblical context and its connection to redemption. However, the answer did not directly address the concern of exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. The student could have incorporated more specific verses that were referenced in the teacher's answer to deepen the biblical foundation aspect of the theology of redemption. There was a good attempt to explain the significance of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate ransom, but linking it more explicitly to the verses provided in the reference answer would have strengthened the response."
