The inclusion of verses from Leviticus, 1 Corinthians, and Hebrews strengthens the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. The response effectively connects the concept of ransom to Jesus Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate payment for humanity's sins. The analysis is well-supported and aligns with a Christian worldview."
