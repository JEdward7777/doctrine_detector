The student effectively showcases how Jesus Christ's sacrifice serves as the ultimate ransom payment for humanity's redemption. The discussion on the book of Hebrews further solidifies the understanding of Christ's sacrifice as central to the theology of redemption. The response could benefit from more direct reference to the additional key verses mentioned in the provided answer (1 Timothy 2:6, Isaiah 43:3, and Matthew 20:28) to further enhance the biblical foundation explored."
