  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: \nWhile the student provided an elaborate response discussing various verses related to covenant faithfulness in both the Old and New Testaments, there were some inaccuracies and lack of depth in the explanations. The selected verses from the Old Testament were relevant, but the interpretation and application of the verses from the New Testament were not entirely accurate, particularly the misattributed quote in Hebrews. Additionally, the response lacked a clear connection between the verses provided and the concept of covenant faithfulness. The student did show an attempt to engage with the question and offer insights, but there is a need for greater precision and clarity in relating scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness."
