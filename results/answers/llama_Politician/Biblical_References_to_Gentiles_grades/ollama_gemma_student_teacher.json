  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a thoughtful and insightful analysis of the two passages, highlighting the inclusion of Gentiles in the early Christian church. The student acknowledges the complexity of the issue and approaches it with sensitivity. However, the student's attempt to avoid offending anyone by skirting around the clear message of the passages slightly undermines the overall quality of the response. Overall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical texts and their relevance to the topic of inclusion."
