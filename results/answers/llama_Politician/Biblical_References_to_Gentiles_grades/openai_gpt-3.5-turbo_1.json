The passages referenced support the idea that faith in Jesus, not adherence to the law, is what justifies Gentiles before God. However, there was some hesitation and unnecessary sensitivity displayed in the response, which could have been more confidently and boldly presented from a Christian worldview perspective. A more assertive and confident tone, aligned with biblical teachings, would have enhanced the overall effectiveness of the interpretation."
