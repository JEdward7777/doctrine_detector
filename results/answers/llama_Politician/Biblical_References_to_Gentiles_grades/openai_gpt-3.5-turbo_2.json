  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a solid exploration of the scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion, referencing relevant passages such as Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16. The student effectively highlights the apostolic mission to Gentiles and emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus for justification. However, there is a lack of confidence and clarity in presenting the Christian worldview, as the student appears to be overly concerned with potential offense and political correctness. Encouragement to strengthen theological assertiveness and avoid compromising biblical truths in light of societal sensitivities would improve the response."
