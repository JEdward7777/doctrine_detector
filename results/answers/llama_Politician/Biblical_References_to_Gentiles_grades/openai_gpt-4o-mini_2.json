  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response offers a good overview of how biblical passages address the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith, emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus over adherence to the Jewish law. However, the excessive nervousness and hesitation displayed in the response may detract from the clarity and confidence needed to effectively communicate the Christian perspective on this topic. Encouragement to be bold and unapologetic in presenting key Christian beliefs would enhance the overall grade of the response."
