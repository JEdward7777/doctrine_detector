  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively engages with the concern by providing a thoughtful exploration of biblical passages related to heaven. The incorporation of Old and New Testament verses, as well as the acknowledgment of different perspectives on heaven, shows a comprehensive approach to the topic. The respectful consideration of various faith traditions demonstrates a nuanced understanding while staying rooted in a Christian worldview. The response could have been enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications of the selected verses and offering more direct connections to the concern at hand. Overall, a solid response with room for further depth and analysis."
