However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on how these references specifically enhance our understanding of God's kingdom and the physical and spiritual realities associated with heaven. Additionally, while the response rightly highlights respect for all faiths and traditions, a clearer integration of a Christian-specific worldview could have further emphasized the uniqueness of Christian beliefs about heaven."
