  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the references to the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost/Shavuot) in both the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament. The inclusion of specific biblical passages adds clarity and depth to the answer. However, the additional comments on interfaith dialogue, while positive in sentiment, slightly detract from the main focus on the biblical references. It would have been better to maintain a more focused approach throughout the response."
