  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Festival of Weeks, including references in both the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament. The information presented demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. However, the initial answer provided a more specific list of books where references can be found, which was not fully addressed in the response. There is also a positive reflection on interfaith dialogue and cooperation, which aligns well with a Christian worldview perspective."
