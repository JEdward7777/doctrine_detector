  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of references to the Festival of Weeks in both the Hebrew Scriptures and the New Testament, demonstrating a strong understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance of Pentecost. The response also emphasizes the importance of approaching these texts with respect and understanding for their cultural and religious contexts. However, the initial answer provided incorrectly stated the specific books where references to the Festival of Weeks can be found, which detracts from the overall accuracy of the response."
