The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to delve into the theological implications of these verses. The focus on diversity and inclusion overshadows the central message of Christ's divinity and the importance of self-control in salvation as depicted in the passages. More emphasis on the biblical context and the nature of Christ as Savior would have improved the response."
