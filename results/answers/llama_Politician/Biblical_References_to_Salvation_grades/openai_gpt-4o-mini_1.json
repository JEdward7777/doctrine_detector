  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response overall is thoughtful and respectful in discussing the scriptural passages. The student effectively touches on the significance of Christ as Savior and the foundational aspect of salvation in the Christian faith. However, there is a slight deviation from the specified concern as the scripture references are not directly incorporated into the analysis. Encouragement to provide more direct scriptural analysis would enhance the depth and coherence of the response in addressing the concern."
