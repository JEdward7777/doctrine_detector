The focus on \"diverse perspectives\" and \"global community\" detracts from the core Christian belief in the exclusive role of Jesus as the Savior. The response lacks a clear affirmation of the unique salvific work of Christ and does not sufficiently emphasize the essential nature of faith in Him for salvation. Encouragement is given for humility and empathy, which are important virtues, but the centrality of Jesus as the exclusive means of salvation is not adequately highlighted."
