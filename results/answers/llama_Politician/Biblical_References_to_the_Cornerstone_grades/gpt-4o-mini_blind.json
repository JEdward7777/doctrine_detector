  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student attempted to approach the question with sensitivity and inclusivity, the response lacks doctrinal correctness and clarity. The student did provide the relevant biblical passages (Ephesians 2:20-22 and Isaiah 28:16-17) referring to Jesus as the cornerstone, but they failed to convey the deep theological significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in Christian belief. The response fell short in explaining the profound implications of Jesus being the cornerstone in uniting believers, serving as the foundation of faith, and fulfilling Old Testament prophecy. A more focused and doctrinally accurate explanation of Jesus as the cornerstone and its implications in salvation and the Church would have been beneficial."
