  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student showed good effort in providing relevant biblical passages and discussing the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in uniting believers. However, their response could be improved by directly addressing the specific verses that reference Jesus as the cornerstone, as indicated in the reference answer. Encouraging further exploration of scripture and emphasizing the unique role of Jesus in Christian theology would enhance the depth of the student's understanding from a Christian worldview."
