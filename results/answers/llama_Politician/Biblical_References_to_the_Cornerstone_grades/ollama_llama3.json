  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively explores the biblical context of Jesus as the cornerstone, providing relevant passages from Ephesians and Isaiah to support their claims. They also acknowledge the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and perspectives, which is in line with the concern of encouraging believers to explore scripture deepens their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response does not directly address the specific verses mentioned in the original answer (Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22). Additionally, while they provide some biblical context, they could have delved deeper into the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in their faith.\n\nThe comment for this grade would be:\n\n\"Your response effectively explores the biblical context of Jesus as the cornerstone, but could benefit from a more direct connection to the original answer. You do an excellent job highlighting the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and perspectives, which aligns well with the concern of encouraging believers to explore scripture deepens their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith.\""
