  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively references relevant biblical passages that highlight Jesus Christ as the cornerstone of faith and the Church. The inclusion of specific verses such as Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22 enhances the depth of understanding of Jesus' significance. The response could be further strengthened by providing more analysis or personal reflection on the impact of these passages on individual faith journeys."
