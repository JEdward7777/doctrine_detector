  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a respectful and inclusive response, which is commendable. However, the specific scriptures referenced are not entirely accurate in relation to the question asked. The student could have provided a more focused and accurate explanation of the key scriptures that discuss the temple as the \"house of Yahweh.\" Further study and attention to the specific scriptures mentioned in the question would have improved the response."
