  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the specific concern by referencing relevant scriptures that discuss the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" as requested. The integration of both Hebrew Bible and New Testament passages adds depth to the analysis. However, the excessive focus on inclusivity and political correctness, while important considerations in societal discourse, slightly detracts from the depth of the theological analysis from a Christian worldview perspective, leading to a slightly lower grade."
