The student also acknowledges the importance of respecting the historical context of the Bible. However, there is a lack of direct connection to the significance of genealogies in establishing Jesus' lineage and fulfilling prophecies, which is a key concern based on a Christian worldview. The response could have strengthened its argument by explicitly tying the understanding of genealogies to the fulfillment of prophecies related to Jesus."
