  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the mark in examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. While they do provide examples of where the term \"woe\" is used in the Bible, their interpretation lacks depth and fails to clearly convey the gravity of God's judgment. Additionally, the attempt to avoid language perceived as judgmental or divisive compromises the clarity and conviction needed in discussing biblical concepts of divine judgment. The response lacks a clear focus on the consequences of sin and the call to repentance inherent in passages using the term \"woe\". Further emphasis on the scriptural context and the weight of God's judgment would have strengthened the answer."
