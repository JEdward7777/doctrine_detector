  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Comprehensive analysis of the term \"woe\" in the Bible.\n* Provides clear examples from Matthew and Luke, offering diverse contexts.\n* Recognizes the need for inclusivity and avoids divisive language.\n* Highlights the possibility of interpreting the passages as calls for reflection and transformation rather than judgment.\n* Concludes with a thoughtful reminder about the importance of compassion and understanding.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Doesn't explicitly address the concern regarding the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture.\n* The connection to Ezekiel and Habakkuk could be elaborated on.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could elaborate more on the specific judgments associated with the examples provided from Ezekiel and Habakkuk.\n* A deeper analysis of the theological implications of these passages concerning divine judgment would enhance the overall response.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThis is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical text and its relevance to the concern about divine judgment. However, incorporating more explicit engagement with the specified concern and further elaboration on the referenced passages would elevate the grade."
