  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides some general information about the term \"woe\" in the Bible, but it does not fully address the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. While the response mentions Jesus' teachings and encourages reflection and personal growth, it downplays the notion of severe judgment and instead emphasizes inclusivity and avoiding judgmental language. This approach is too lenient and does not adequately explore the concept of woe in a way that takes seriously the seriousness of divine judgment. The response also fails to engage with the provided answer or concern directly, making it difficult to assess its effectiveness in addressing the issue."
