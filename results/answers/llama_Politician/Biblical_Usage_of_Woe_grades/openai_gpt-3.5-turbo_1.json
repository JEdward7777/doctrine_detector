  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response does an adequate job of discussing the term \"woe\" in the Bible and providing examples, but it falls short in addressing the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. The focus on sensitivity as a politician detracts from emphasizing the gravity of divine judgment in the context of the provided concern. The response misses the opportunity to delve deeper into the biblical perspective on the consequences of sin and the need for repentance. The concern raised was not effectively addressed from a Christian worldview perspective."
