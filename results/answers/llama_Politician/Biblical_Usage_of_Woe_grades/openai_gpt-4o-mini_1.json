  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response deviates significantly from the Christian perspective on divine judgment as expressed through scripture. It downplays the severity of divine judgment and focuses more on inclusivity, personal growth, and avoiding judgmental language, which is not in line with the biblical teachings on the consequences of sin and leading others astray. The response misses the opportunity to emphasize the seriousness of divine judgment in the examples provided."
