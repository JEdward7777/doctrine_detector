However, the response falls short of fully embracing the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed in scripture. It leans more towards a humanistic perspective of reflection and personal growth rather than acknowledging the gravity of God's judgment on sin and leading others astray. The sensitivity towards avoiding judgmental language, while important in certain contexts, should not overshadow the biblical truth of divine judgment."
