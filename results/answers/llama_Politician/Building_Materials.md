## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
During biblical times, the construction of altars was indeed an important aspect of worship and religious practices. I'm happy to provide you with some insight on the common materials used to build these sacred spaces.

From my understanding, altars in ancient Israel were often constructed using natural stone or earth materials. The Bible describes the use of stones, such as unhewn stones (Exodus 20:25) and cairns of stones (Joshua 8:28), for building altars. These stones were likely chosen for their durability and ability to withstand the elements.

In addition to stone, other natural materials like earth, wood, and even ceramic vessels were also used in altar construction. For instance, the tabernacle's altar was constructed using cedar wood (Exodus 37:25-28).

It's essential to note that the specific materials used might have varied depending on the region, cultural context, and personal preferences of the individuals building the altars.

Now, I must emphasize that it's crucial for us to approach these ancient practices with sensitivity and respect for the diverse cultures and beliefs represented in the biblical accounts. By doing so, we can foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for the spiritual and cultural significance of altar construction during biblical times.

Thank you for asking such an informative question!
