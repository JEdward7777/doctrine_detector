They correctly mentioned the use of natural stones and earth materials, as well as the inclusion of wood and metal in certain special altars. Additionally, the student emphasized the importance of approaching ancient practices with respect and sensitivity, which aligns with a Christian worldview of valuing cultural and historical understanding. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused specifically on the materials like dirt, stones, wood, and metals mentioned in the reference answer."
