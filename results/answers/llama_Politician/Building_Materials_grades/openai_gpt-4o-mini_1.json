  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive overview of the materials commonly used in constructing altars during biblical times, going beyond the initial answer to include additional insights from the Bible. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of understanding altar construction in relation to biblical practices and worship reverence. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more direct references to specific passages in the Bible to strengthen the biblical foundation of the insights shared."
