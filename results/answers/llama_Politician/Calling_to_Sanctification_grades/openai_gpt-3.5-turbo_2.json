However, the concern raised about emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process is not fully addressed. The response focuses more on love, compassion, and inclusivity rather than individual accountability in pursuing personal holiness. A stronger emphasis on the role of personal responsibility in sanctification would improve the overall alignment with a Christian worldview."
