  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus, highlighting important points about faith, humility, and recognizing God's sovereignty. However, the student could have focused more directly on the nature of faith and authority in the context of Jesus' ministry, rather than delving into broader themes of leadership and inclusivity. A more focused response on the specific concern would have strengthened the answer."
