They correctly highlight the importance of this encounter in demonstrating the universal appeal of the Gospel message and the inclusivity of Christianity. However, the response tends to meander and lacks conciseness in directly addressing the concern related to the mission of the Church to reach all nations. While the student's enthusiasm and engagement with the topic are commendable, the answer could benefit from more focus on addressing the specific concern provided. Further development of how this event exemplifies the mission of the Church to reach all nations and underscores the inclusivity of the Gospel would enhance the response."
