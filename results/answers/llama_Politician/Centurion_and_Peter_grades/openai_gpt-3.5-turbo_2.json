However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of the event in relation to the mission of the Church to reach all nations. Additionally, while the response touches on the universal appeal of the Gospel, it could have connected this more explicitly with the core Christian belief in the Great Commission to spread the Good News to all people. Overall, a well-written and positive interpretation with room for more in-depth theological analysis."
