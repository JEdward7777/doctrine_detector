The mention of God's love and salvation for all people aligns with the mission of the Church to reach all nations. The response could have been improved by directly referencing specific Bible verses or theological principles that support the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. Additionally, the use of engaging language and personal anecdotes, while thoughtfully done, could detract slightly from the clarity of the theological discussion."
