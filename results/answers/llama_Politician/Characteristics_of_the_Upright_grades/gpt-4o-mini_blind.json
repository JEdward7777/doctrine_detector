  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: \nThe student has demonstrated a good understanding of the qualities that define an upright person in the biblical context. They have referenced relevant scriptures and highlighted key virtues such as justice, integrity, compassion, and wisdom. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing the centrality of faith in God and reliance on His grace for true uprightness. Additionally, the student's mention of subjectivity in defining uprightness could be tempered with a clearer assertion of the objective moral standards set forth by God in the Bible. Encouraging a deeper theological reflection on the source and nature of true uprightness would enhance the response."
