  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of qualities that define an upright person in the biblical context, aligning well with the reference answer. However, there was a slight deviation in the discussion towards subjectivity and political engagement, which although valuable, was not directly addressing the biblical definition of uprightness. Focusing more on the core biblical aspects would have improved the grade."
