It minimizes the importance of understanding the distinct roles and authorities that existed within the priesthood, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the religious structure at that time. The response focuses more on inclusivity and unity rather than providing an accurate explanation based on the hierarchical structure as described in the Bible."
