  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-intentioned in promoting inclusivity and unity, misses the mark in addressing the specific concern about the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel. The reference answer clearly states that the chief priests held a higher rank and power than ordinary priests, with the high priest having the most authority. The student's response does not directly address this hierarchical structure and instead focuses on promoting inclusivity without providing a clear explanation of the relationship between chief priests and ordinary priests in terms of authority. A stronger emphasis on addressing the specific concern and the hierarchical structure within ancient Israel's religious leadership would have been more appropriate."
