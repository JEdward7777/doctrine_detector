  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern, examining the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel, by acknowledging the importance of recognizing diversity within the group of priests. The author also makes a valiant effort to clarify the concept of \"chief priests\" and \"ordinary priests,\" pointing out that creating hierarchies might not be entirely accurate.\n\nHowever, I deduct 10 points because the response does not directly address the provided answer (\"The chief priests held a higher rank and power than the ordinary priests, with the high priest holding the most authority.\") Instead, it offers an alternative perspective on the Jewish tradition of Kohanim. While this is a great effort to provide nuance and avoid creating divisions, it doesn't explicitly refute or challenge the given answer.\n\nOverall, the response shows a good understanding of the concern and attempts to address it in a respectful and inclusive manner."
