The student correctly acknowledges the existence of distinctions in rank and authority among priests, with chief priests having higher authority than ordinary priests. The response also addresses the concern by providing a nuanced perspective that upholds the diversity of perspectives and contributions within the religious leadership structure, emphasizing unity and respect. Overall, this response aligns well with a Christian view of promoting inclusivity and cooperation while respecting the historical context of religious leadership in ancient Israel."
