The answer acknowledges the distinctions within the hierarchy of priests without undermining the value of each individual's role. It promotes inclusivity and unity while respecting the diversity within the leadership structure. The response could have further emphasized the significance of the high priest's role in religious practices, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview."
