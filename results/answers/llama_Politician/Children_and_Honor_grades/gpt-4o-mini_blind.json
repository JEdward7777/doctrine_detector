  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student acknowledges the biblical instruction to \"honor your father and mother,\" the response lacks a clear foundation in Christian doctrine. The emphasis on societal inclusivity and diverse family structures detracts from the core biblical principle of honoring parents. To improve the grade, the student should focus on explaining and applying the biblical teachings on honoring parents within a Christian worldview."
