  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-intentioned, strays too far from the specific Biblical instructions regarding honoring parents. The Biblical expectation is for children to show respect and obedience to their parents, as it is aligned with God's commandments. The student's response, while advocating for inclusive and supportive family structures, fails to address the core Biblical guidance on honoring parents."
