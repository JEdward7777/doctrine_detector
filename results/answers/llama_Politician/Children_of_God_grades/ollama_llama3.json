While it does not directly address the concern about deepening one's faith and sense of belonging in the Christian community, it implicitly touches on these themes by describing the phrase as fostering a sense of belonging, unity, and community among believers.\n\nThe response is strong in its ability to develop ideas and provide supporting examples, but could be strengthened by more explicitly addressing the concern and highlighting specific ways in which being referred to as \"children of God\" can deepen one's faith and sense of belonging. Nevertheless, it demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and provides a thoughtful exploration of its implications."
