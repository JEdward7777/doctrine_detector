  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and thoughtful exploration of the evolution of the term \"Christ\" throughout the New Testament. They demonstrated a good understanding of the term's significance and its implications for understanding Jesus' identity and purpose. However, the student spent a significant portion of their answer discussing the importance of respecting different religious beliefs, which while valid, was not directly relevant to the question at hand. Streamlining the answer to focus more on the evolution of the term 'Christ' would have further enhanced their response."
