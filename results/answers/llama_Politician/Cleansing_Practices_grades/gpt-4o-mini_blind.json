  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has made an effort to connect modern practices with the concept of ritual cleanliness from the Old Testament, emphasizing inclusivity, empathy, and understanding. While the suggestions provided are well-intentioned and promote positive habits, the response falls short in directly addressing the specific rituals and laws outlined in the Old Testament regarding cleanliness. The focus on personal hygiene, mindful eating, community service, reflection, and inclusive language is relevant but lacks a strong tie to the Old Testament principles of ritual purity and holiness. The grade reflects the effort put into the response, even though it could have delved deeper into the biblical context of ritual cleanliness."
