The suggestions offered align well with the concern of incorporating ancient teachings into contemporary faith practice to enhance spiritual growth and accountability. The response could benefit from a more direct connection to the Christian worldview and specific references to biblical teachings on ritual cleanliness. Overall, a solid effort with room for further integration of Christian perspectives."
