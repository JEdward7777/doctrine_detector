The inclusion of views from various faiths, while important for inclusivity, dilutes the Christian-specific understanding of a clear conscience as rooted in biblical teachings. Encouraging mutual understanding and compassion is commendable, but a stronger emphasis on the distinctive Christian perspective on spiritual health and obedience to God would have been more appropriate in this context."
