However, the inclusion of the perspective that this concept is not exclusive to Christians and the emphasis on inclusivity and respect for all faiths may dilute the focus on the Christian-specific worldview. It would be stronger if it more explicitly tied the importance of a clear conscience to the unique relationship believers have with God through Christ."
