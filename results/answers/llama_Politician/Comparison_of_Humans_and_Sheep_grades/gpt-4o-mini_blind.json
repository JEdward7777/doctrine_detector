However, the answer does not delve deeply into the doctrinal implications of this metaphor within Christian theology. It is important to highlight that the relationship between humans and sheep in the Bible also signifies the need for guidance, protection, and redemption provided by Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd (John 10:11). The response could have further elaborated on this theological aspect to provide a more comprehensive understanding from a Christian worldview."
