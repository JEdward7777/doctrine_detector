  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response approaches the question with care and sensitivity, acknowledging the differing perspectives that may exist. It effectively connects the comparison between humans and sheep in biblical teaching to the concept of human vulnerability and the need for divine guidance. The reference to Psalm 23:1-4 provides a solid biblical foundation for the interpretation presented. The response rightly highlights the importance of approaching the topic with respect and creating an inclusive space for dialogue. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to provide a more explicit link between the specific concern raised and the interpretation of the comparison discussed in the response."
