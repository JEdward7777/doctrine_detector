## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful question! As someone who values inclusivity and respect for all, I'm delighted to share some inspiring examples of compassion from the Bible.

One notable example is found in Luke 7:11-17, where Jesus shows compassion to a widow whose only son has died. Despite being surrounded by chaos and noise, He takes the time to comfort her and bring her peace. This selfless act demonstrates His empathy and understanding towards those who are grieving or marginalized.

Another powerful example is Rahab's story in Joshua 2:1-21. As a Canaanite woman, she shows remarkable compassion towards the Israelites by hiding them from certain destruction and providing them with food and shelter. Her bravery and kindness ultimately lead to her inclusion among the people of God.

In John 4:46-54, we see Jesus demonstrate compassion towards the nobleman's son who is ill. Despite being a foreigner, Jesus travels great distances to heal the boy, exemplifying His love for all people, regardless of their background or social status.

Lastly, I'd like to highlight the story of Peter and Cornelius in Acts 10:1-48. Peter shows compassion by accepting and embracing Cornelius, a Gentile, as an equal before God. This encounter marks a significant turning point in the early Christian church, demonstrating that God's love knows no cultural or racial boundaries.

These examples illustrate the importance of compassion in our faith journey. As we strive to emulate these biblical figures, let us remember to extend kindness, empathy, and understanding towards all people, regardless of their background, race, religion, or social status.

May these stories inspire us to be like Christ â€“ full of love, mercy, and compassion for all humanity!
