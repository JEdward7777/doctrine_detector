However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the examples of compassion to the core Christian belief of following the example of Jesus Christ as the ultimate embodiment of compassion. Additionally, the language of inclusivity and respect could have been framed more within the context of biblical teachings rather than modern societal values. Integrating more directly Christian-centric language and theological reflections would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response."
