  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided well-detailed examples from the Bible where individuals demonstrated compassion, showcasing a good understanding of the concept. However, the student could have tied the examples more directly to real-life applications of compassion as modeled by biblical figures, as requested in the concern. Overall, a strong effort, but could benefit from more explicit connections to practical applications of compassion in everyday life."
