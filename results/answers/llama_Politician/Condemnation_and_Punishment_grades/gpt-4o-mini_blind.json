However, it lacks doctrinal clarity and fails to delve deep into the full theological implications of these verses. The response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the biblical concepts of justice, sin, and the atonement of Christ. Additionally, while advocating for rehabilitation and restoration is commendable, the answer could have integrated a more robust scriptural foundation on the nature of punishment and redemption within a Christian worldview."
