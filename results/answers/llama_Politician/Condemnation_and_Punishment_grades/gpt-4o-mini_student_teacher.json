  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a well-thought-out analysis of the biblical teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22, emphasizing the importance of understanding, compassion, forgiveness, and rehabilitation in the context of punishment. The response effectively integrates the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in punishment and acknowledges the value of respectful dialogue and differing interpretations. However, the student could have connected their analysis more directly to the reference answer provided by the teacher to demonstrate a deeper understanding of how these teachings shape our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation from a Christian worldview."
