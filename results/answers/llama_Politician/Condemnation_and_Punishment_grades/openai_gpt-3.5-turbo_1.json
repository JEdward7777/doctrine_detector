  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 regarding mercy, forgiveness, and the redemptive power of God. The student effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of balancing divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment. The response is well-structured, respectful of diverse perspectives, and offers a thoughtful analysis grounded in a Christian worldview. The only minor room for improvement could be to further elaborate on how divine justice and mercy work together in the context of punishment, but overall, this is an excellent response."
