The student effectively incorporates relevant verses from Matthew and Psalms to support their argument regarding the importance of showing mercy and forgiveness in punishment. The emphasis on rehabilitation and restoration aligns well with a Christian worldview that values redemption and transformation. The acknowledgment of the need for respectful dialogue and consideration of diverse perspectives also reflects a compassionate approach rooted in Christian principles. Overall, a strong and well-articulated response, with only minor room for improvement in further exploring the tension between divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment."
