  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-thought-out response demonstrating a good understanding of the complex relationship between confessing Jesus as Lord and being saved according to Paul's writings. They correctly highlight the personal and transformative aspect of this confession. However, the response could be improved by aligning more closely with the reference answer, which clearly states the direct connection between confessing Jesus as Lord and being saved without delving too deeply into other theological considerations. The student effectively addresses the concern about theological implications but could have emphasized the central role of confession and belief as outlined in the reference answer."
