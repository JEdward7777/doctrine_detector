The emphasis on inclusivity and general spiritual principles dilutes the specific Christian teaching of confession and reliance on God's strength to fight against sin. The response lacks a solid foundation in biblical doctrine and fails to highlight the unique grace and redemption offered through Christ. Further grounding in Christian theology and a more explicit connection between personal sin and God's forgiveness is needed for a stronger Christian worldview perspective."
