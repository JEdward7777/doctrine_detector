The focus on inclusivity and general reflections on values and principles, while important, dilute the Christian-specific perspective on the relationship between sin, repentance, and God's forgiveness. The response could have been strengthened by aligning more closely with the provided answer and addressing the concern more directly from a Christian worldview."
