The incorporation of Christian beliefs regarding conscience is well done, highlighting the role of conscience as the voice of God guiding individuals towards right action. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the specific understanding of sin and how conscience helps differentiate between right and wrong based on biblical teachings. The response could have been stronger by directly tying the concept of conscience to sin and the Christian worldview of morality."
