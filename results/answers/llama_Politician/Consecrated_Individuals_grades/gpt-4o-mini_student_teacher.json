  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that showcased knowledge of several key individuals consecrated to God in the Bible. However, the response focused more on the general significance and impact of these individuals rather than explicitly addressing the question. The student could have received a higher grade by directly mentioning the priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child as specifically highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, the response could have incorporated more scriptural references to support the examples given."
