  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response beautifully discusses individuals consecrated to serving God in the Bible, highlighting key figures such as Abraham, Moses, David, Peter, and Mary. It appropriately emphasizes the importance of faith, obedience, and trust in God's plan. However, the response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern about the significance of consecrated individuals in biblical history and by explicitly connecting the examples provided to the concept of consecration to God. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and offered insightful reflections."
