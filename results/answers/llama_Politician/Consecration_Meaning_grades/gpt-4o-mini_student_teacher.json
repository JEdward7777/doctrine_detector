  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation of consecration in the Christian context, demonstrating an understanding of setting apart for a higher purpose. However, there is a slight dilution of the Christian-specific perspective by emphasizing inclusivity with other faiths. While respect for other beliefs is commendable, the importance of consecration in serving God is not strongly emphasized in the response. This dilution lowers the grade slightly."
