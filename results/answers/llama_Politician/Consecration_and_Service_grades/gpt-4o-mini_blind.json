However, the mention of being inclusive and avoiding offense at the end detracts from a clear assertion of Christian beliefs as the absolute truth. Additionally, the analogy of 'divine real estate transaction' could potentially be misunderstood and may not align perfectly with Christian doctrine. It would be better to stick to more traditional theological explanations. Overall, a solid response but could benefit from stronger doctrinal emphasis and clarity."
