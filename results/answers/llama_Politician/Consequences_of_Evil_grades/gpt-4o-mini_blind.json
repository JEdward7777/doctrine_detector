However, there are significant theological inaccuracies and a lack of emphasis on the foundational Christian belief of sin, judgment, and the need for repentance and redemption through Christ. The analysis lacks a clear distinction between the consequences of evil in biblical narratives and the broader societal implications. The intersectional lens and social justice perspectives, while important in a secular context, should not overshadow the fundamental teachings of the Bible. There is a need for a stronger emphasis on the divine aspects of justice, mercy, and forgiveness central to Christian doctrine."
