  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the consequences of evil as illustrated in biblical references. They provide well-chosen examples from the text and skillfully connect them to broader societal and personal implications. The inclusion of an intersectional lens and awareness of historical context adds depth to their analysis. However, including a direct connection to the provided reference answer would have strengthened their overall response."
