  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated response citing relevant biblical passages about pride and humility. They demonstrate an understanding of the importance of humility and its positive implications. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern regarding the spiritual implications of pride versus humility, and by incorporating more specific references to God's role in humbling the proud and uplifting the humble as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, a strong effort with room for deeper theological reflection."
