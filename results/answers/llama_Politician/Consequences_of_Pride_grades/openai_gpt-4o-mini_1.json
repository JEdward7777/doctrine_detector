The inclusion of specific biblical references such as Proverbs 11:2 and 16:18, as well as Psalm 51:17, effectively supports the importance of humility and the consequences of pride. The response also emphasizes the need for empathy, compassion, and contextual understanding when discussing these concepts. Overall, the integration of biblical teachings with practical implications for leadership is well-executed. Great job!"
