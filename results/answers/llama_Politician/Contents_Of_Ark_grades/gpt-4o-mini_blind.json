However, it lacks doctrinal accuracy in some aspects. It correctly mentions the Tablets of the Covenant, the jar of manna, and Aaron's rod, but it could have elaborated more on their specific significance and roles within the Ark. The inclusion of sensitivity and respect for different perspectives is commendable, but in a Christian worldview context, it's essential to prioritize biblical accuracy and theological significance when discussing sacred objects such as the Ark of the Covenant."
