  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful and inclusive answer on identifying corrupt influences. The emphasis on reflection of personal values, seeking wisdom from trusted sources, engaging in dialogue, and cultivating empathy is commendable. However, the response lacks a clear distinction between identifying worldly influences based on biblical principles versus a more general altruistic approach. Encouraging Christians to discern between worldly values and God's truth could strengthen the answer. Additionally, referencing specific biblical principles or examples would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
