  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful response that emphasizes the importance of remaining vigilant in identifying corrupt influences. However, the student's answer lacks a specific focus on examining behaviors and attitudes that contradict biblical teachings, which is a central aspect of identifying corrupt influences from a Christian worldview. While the student's suggestions on reflection, seeking wisdom, dialogue, empathy, and awareness are valuable, they could have been strengthened by explicitly tying them back to biblical teachings and discernment."
