However, the emphasis on inclusivity and sensitivity may lead to a lack of clarity on the theological significance of these covenants. It is important to highlight the unconditional nature of God's promises in the context of His sovereignty and grace, rather than potentially minimizing the essential aspects of sin, repentance, and faith in understanding these covenants. More emphasis on the conditions and implications of these covenants in relation to faith and obedience would improve the theological depth of the response."
