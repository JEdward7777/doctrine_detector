  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-structured and detailed response to the question about conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible. They have correctly identified examples of both types of covenants and explained the dynamics of God's promises and expectations within these covenants. The only area for improvement is that the student could have connected the covenants more explicitly to the expectations of obedience and faithfulness to God, which are crucial aspects of understanding God's promises in covenants from a Christian worldview."
