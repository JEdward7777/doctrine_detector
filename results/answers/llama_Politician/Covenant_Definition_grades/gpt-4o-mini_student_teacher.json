  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student's response, while respectful and inclusive, lacks depth and specificity in addressing the concern of understanding the nature of biblical covenants. The student touched on some key elements of covenants but did not clearly define or explain them in relation to the biblical context. The response focused more on being politically correct and open to various interpretations rather than providing a clear biblical definition. Moving forward, the student should focus on incorporating a more detailed and accurate explanation of biblical concepts in their responses."
