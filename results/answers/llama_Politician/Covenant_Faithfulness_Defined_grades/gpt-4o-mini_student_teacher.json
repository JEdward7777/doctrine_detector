  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the general concept of covenant faithfulness in relationships, it lacks specificity in the context of biblical relationships. The answer did not adequately emphasize the importance of God's covenant with His people or the deeper spiritual implications of covenant faithfulness in biblical contexts. The student focused more on general principles of loyalty and trust, rather than tying these concepts back to the divine covenant relationship. There is room for improvement in connecting the concept to its foundational significance in the Bible."
