The focus on promoting unity and inclusivity, while important, should not overshadow the significance of God's covenant with the Israelites as central to their identity and relationship with Him in a Christian worldview. The response could have emphasized more on the divine significance and implications of the covenant rather than solely focusing on promoting tolerance and understanding."
