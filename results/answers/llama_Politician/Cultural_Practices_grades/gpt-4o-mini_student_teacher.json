  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful exploration of the Jewish view of Gentiles and its impact on early Christian practices. They demonstrated a clear understanding of the cultural practices and perceptions surrounding Gentiles in both the Jewish tradition and early Christian communities. The student effectively connected these cultural norms to faith-based practices and emphasized the importance of inclusivity and acceptance in navigating these complexities. The response could be improved by incorporating more specific examples or references to support their points and further strengthen the argument."
