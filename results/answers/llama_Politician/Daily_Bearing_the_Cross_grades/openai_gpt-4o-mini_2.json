It aligns well with the Christian worldview of discipleship and the personal cost of following Christ, while also emphasizing the importance of creating an environment of empathy and understanding. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the central role of Jesus Christ in the concept of taking up one's cross, which is foundational in Christian teachings."
