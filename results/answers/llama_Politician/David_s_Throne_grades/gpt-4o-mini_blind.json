  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: While the student shows enthusiasm and attempts to engage with the topic, there are several points of concern from a Christian theological perspective. The response lacks doctrinal precision and fails to emphasize key aspects of the promise of David's throne from a Christian viewpoint. The student's focus on diversity and sensitivity, while important in certain contexts, detracts from the central significance of God's eternal covenant and the role of Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic promise. Encouraging deeper exploration of biblical texts and theological foundations would improve the overall theological accuracy of the answer."
