However, the answer lacks focus and clarity, as it meanders into discussing the diversity of perspectives and experiences within the community without directly addressing the central concern of recognizing the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus. The response could have been more concise and directly tied back to the specific theological implications of this promise."
