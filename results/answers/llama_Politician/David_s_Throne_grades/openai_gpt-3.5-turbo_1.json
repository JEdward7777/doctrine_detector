The speaker effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the eternal covenant and sovereignty represented by this promise, ultimately linking it back to Jesus as the culmination of God's plan. The inclusion of a call for sensitivity and respect towards differing perspectives adds depth to the discussion, making it a well-rounded and insightful response from a Christian worldview perspective."
