  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while thoughtful and respectful, missed the essential Christian view regarding the 'day of the Lord.' The New Testament emphasizes the significance of Jesus' return for judgment, which was not clearly articulated in the student's response. Encouraging inclusivity and empathy is admirable, but in a Christian worldview, understanding the solemn implications of the 'day of the Lord' for believers is crucial. The student should have focused more on the biblical teachings and theological significance of this event."
