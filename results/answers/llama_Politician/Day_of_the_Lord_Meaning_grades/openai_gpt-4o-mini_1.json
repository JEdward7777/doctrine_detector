However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the Christian belief that this event represents the return of the Lord Jesus to judge the living and the dead. The response could have strengthened its Christian perspective by highlighting the importance of faith in Christ, repentance, and the need for believers to be prepared for this day. Further integration of Christian theology and scriptural references would have enhanced the response."
