  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student showed a basic understanding of the role of a deacon in the local church, mentioning serving as a servant-leader, providing spiritual guidance, and being a bridge between the church and community. However, the answer lacked doctrinal precision and clarity. The attempt at humor detracted from the seriousness of the topic and could be seen as disrespectful towards the sacred role of a deacon. Encouragement to focus on presenting the information with reverence and accuracy in the future."
