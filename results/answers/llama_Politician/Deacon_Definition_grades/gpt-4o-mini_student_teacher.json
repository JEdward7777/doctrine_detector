  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear understanding of the biblical role of servanthood in the church. While they mention the idea of serving and humility, their response is largely vague and lacks depth. The primary role of a deacon, as outlined in the reference answer, focuses on practical assistance to fellow believers with needs such as food or money, which the student failed to address adequately. The response also includes unnecessary filler and attempts at humor that detract from providing a coherent answer in line with the Christian worldview."
