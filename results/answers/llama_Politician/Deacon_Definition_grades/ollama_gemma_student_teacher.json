  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 50\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates some understanding of the role of deacons, but it lacks depth and fails to address the concern regarding biblical servanthood. The response relies on generic and superficial statements without offering any specific examples or textual references to support the claims made. The comedic elements and nervous tone further detract from the overall coherence and clarity of the answer."
