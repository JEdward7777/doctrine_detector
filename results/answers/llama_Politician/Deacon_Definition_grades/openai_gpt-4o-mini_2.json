  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the practical aspect of a deacon's role in serving fellow believers with practical needs, aligning with the biblical role of servanthood in the church. However, the response lacks depth in connecting this role to the broader spiritual responsibilities of a deacon as a servant-leader and bridge between the church and community. Encouraging further exploration and articulation of the spiritual significance of servanthood within the biblical context would strengthen the response."
