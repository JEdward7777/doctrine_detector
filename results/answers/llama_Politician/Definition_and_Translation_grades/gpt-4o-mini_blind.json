The focus on inclusivity and avoiding perceived insensitivity or exclusivity is commendable, but it should not compromise the theological accuracy of the translations. A Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of accurately conveying biblical concepts and principles, even if they may be challenging or uncomfortable to some. The response would benefit from a stronger emphasis on the scriptural meaning of \"intercede\" and its theological significance within Christianity."
