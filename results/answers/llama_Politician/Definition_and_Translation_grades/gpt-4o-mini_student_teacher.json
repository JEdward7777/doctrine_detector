  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful alternative translations for the term \"intercede\" and demonstrated sensitivity to inclusivity and cultural nuances. However, the student's answer included unnecessary emphasis on inclusivity and community diversity, which although important, detracted from the focus on the specific translations of the term. Some suggestions for improvement would be to streamline the response and focus more on the direct alternative translations provided."
