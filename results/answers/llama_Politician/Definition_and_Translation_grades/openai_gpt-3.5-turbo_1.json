The response does not directly address the concern of shedding light on the various nuances and implications of intercession within a Christian worldview. There is an attempt to broaden the discussion to embrace diversity and unity, which is commendable, but the theological depth and specificity related to intercessory prayer could have been more explicitly addressed."
