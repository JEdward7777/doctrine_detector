The explanation shows consideration for different contexts and a sensitivity towards inclusivity. However, it would have been beneficial to further delve into the theological implications and biblical examples of intercession within a Christian worldview. Overall, a strong effort in addressing the concern with a thoughtful and respectful approach."
