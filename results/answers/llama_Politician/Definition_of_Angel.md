## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
A wonderful question! *clears throat* I'm happy to provide an answer that's respectful, inclusive, and sensitive to all beliefs and faiths.

According to traditional Christian scripture and Jewish tradition, angels are often depicted as divine messengers or spiritual beings who serve as intermediaries between humans and the Divine. The biblical definition of an angel is not explicitly stated, but we can look at various passages for insights.

In the Hebrew Bible, angels are referred to as "messengers" (Hebrew: מלאך, mal'ach) or "spirits" (Hebrew: רוח, ruah). In the New Testament, Jesus is often called the "Angel of the Lord" (Matthew 2:13, Luke 2:9-12), highlighting his role as a divine messenger.

As for their primary role, angels are typically seen as:

1. Messengers: They convey messages from God to humans or other heavenly beings.
2. Servants: Angels serve God and carry out His will, often in the context of human affairs.
3. Protectors: Some angels are depicted as guardians or protectors of individuals, nations, or communities.

It's essential to note that these roles might not be exhaustive, and different faiths and traditions may have varying understandings of angelic functions.

Now, I'd like to emphasize that this answer is grounded in the biblical narrative and acknowledges the diversity of beliefs surrounding angels. I hope this response has been informative, respectful, and inclusive for all those with an interest in this topic!
