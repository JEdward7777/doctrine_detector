  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The answer provided a good overview of the biblical understanding of angels and their roles as messengers, servants, and protectors. However, the answer seemed to prioritize inclusivity and sensitivity over doctrinal correctness. The language used was more focused on being respectful to various beliefs and faiths, rather than clearly articulating the traditional Christian perspective. A more focused and doctrinally accurate explanation of angels based on Christian scripture would have improved the grade."
