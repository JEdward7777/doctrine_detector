The response could have incorporated more explicit references to biblical passages or theological teachings that highlight these aspects, which are crucial in a Christian worldview for believers seeking spiritual comfort and assurance. Additionally, while being respectful and inclusive is praised, presenting a clear Christian perspective rooted in biblical teachings is essential when addressing theological concepts."
