  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The response lacks doctrinal correctness as it fails to provide a clear, biblical definition of who is classified as a believer according to the Bible. While promoting inclusivity and respect is important, it should not come at the expense of watering down or avoiding biblical truths. The focus should have been on accurately representing the teachings of the Bible regarding what qualifies someone as a believer. Encouraging unity is commendable, but it should be rooted in biblical truth."
