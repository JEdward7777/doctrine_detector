It is commendable that the response promotes inclusivity and respect, but it should also emphasize the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as central to Christian beliefs and salvation. Further discussion on the unique relationship believers have with Christ and the implications of this belief on their lives would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview."
