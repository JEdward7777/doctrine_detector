The focus on promoting inclusivity and avoiding theological debates, while important in fostering unity, detracts from the opportunity to emphasize the foundational beliefs and teachings of Christianity regarding salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. More clarity and conviction in communicating the Christian perspective on the identity and significance of being a believer in Christ would have strengthened the response."
