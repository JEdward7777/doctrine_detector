However, there is a significant focus on inclusivity and potential concerns of patriarchy, which somewhat detracts from the specific concern regarding understanding the depth of God's love for Jesus and its relevance to believers. The response could have delved deeper into this theological aspect rather than primarily discussing potential social implications."
