The response also acknowledges the person's inherent value as a child of God. However, the answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the divine aspect of blessing and could have included more scriptural references to support the explanation. Additionally, while inclusivity is important, it is also essential to present Christian teachings with doctrinal correctness as a higher priority."
