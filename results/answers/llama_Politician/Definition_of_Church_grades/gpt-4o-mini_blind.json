  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: \n\nWhile the answer shows an attempt to approach the topic with sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs, it falls short in providing a clear and doctrinally accurate explanation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament. The answer lacks theological depth and fails to convey a solid understanding of the biblical concept of the church as taught in the New Testament. Furthermore, prioritizing inclusivity and diversity over doctrinal precision undermines the importance of conveying authentic Christian teachings. Moving forward, the student should focus on presenting biblical truths accurately and clearly without compromising foundational Christian doctrine."
