  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student made an effort to address the diversity of perspectives on the term \"church,\" they did not directly address the concern of the church's role as more than just a building. The reference answer specifies that 'church' in the New Testament refers to all people who believe in Jesus, often identified as a local assembly of believers meeting together. The student's response lacked a clear and direct explanation of this essential aspect, hence the lower grade. Encouragement to provide a more focused and specific response next time."
