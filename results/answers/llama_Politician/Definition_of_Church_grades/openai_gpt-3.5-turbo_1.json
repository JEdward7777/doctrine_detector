The response lacks a clear affirmation of the scriptural teaching that the church is composed of all believers in Jesus, rather than solely a physical gathering place. Additionally, there is a lack of emphasis on the biblical foundation of the church's identity and purpose beyond just being a community of like-minded individuals. More explicit integration of the biblical worldview regarding the church's spiritual significance would have strengthened the response."
