  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response, while well-intentioned, falls short in addressing the concern of understanding the church's role as more than just a building. The student briefly touches on different interpretations of the term \"church\" but does not clearly emphasize the biblical perspective of the church being the people who believe in Jesus Christ, not just a physical structure or gathering. There is also a lack of depth in discussing the significance of the church as a body of believers united in faith. Overall, the response lacks a strong Christian-specific worldview perspective on the role of the church according to the New Testament."
