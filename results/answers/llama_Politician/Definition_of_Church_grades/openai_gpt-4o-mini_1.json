However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about understanding the church's role as more than just a building. While the response acknowledges the diversity of interpretations, it does not clearly emphasize the broader significance of the church as a community of believers united in faith in Jesus Christ beyond physical structures. In future responses, it would be beneficial to directly tie in the biblical understanding of the church as a spiritual body rather than solely focusing on diverse interpretations."
