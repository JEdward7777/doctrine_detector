  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and respectful response exploring various metaphors and attributes of God as portrayed in the Bible. However, the answer lacks a clear and concise definition of God's nature as presented in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's emphasis on inclusivity and respect for diverse perspectives, while important in a broader context, detracts from specifically focusing on the Christian view of God's nature as defined in the Bible. A more direct and precise explanation aligning with the Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
