However, the concern expressed about understanding God's nature truthfully for proper worship and relationship was not directly addressed or emphasized. While the response was informative and upheld a respectful tone, it lacked a clear alignment with the importance of accurate understanding of God's nature for believers. A stronger connection to the essentiality of accurate theological understanding in the context of Christian worship and relationship would have further enhanced the response."
