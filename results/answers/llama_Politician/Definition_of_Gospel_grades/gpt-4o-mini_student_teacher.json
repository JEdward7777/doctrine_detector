  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a general overview of the term \"gospel\" and its significance in the Christian faith. However, there is a lack of depth and specific focus on the defined answer provided by the teacher. The student's approach, while positive and inclusive, deviates from the specific Christian understanding of the Gospel as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, the response contains unnecessary tangents and lacks precision in addressing the concern at hand. Moving forward, a more focused and direct approach aligning with the Christian perspective would improve the grade."
