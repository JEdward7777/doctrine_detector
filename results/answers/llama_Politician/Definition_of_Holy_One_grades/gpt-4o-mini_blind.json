The answer should have delved deeper into the biblical implications of the term, emphasizing the holiness, purity, and transcendence of God as the \"Holy One.\" Additionally, the response could have highlighted the unique concept of God's holiness within Christianity and its implications for believers. There is a need for improvement in presenting an accurate and scripturally grounded perspective on the term in question."
