  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks specificity and depth in addressing the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible from a Christian worldview. Instead of focusing on the holiness of God and His unique role in Scripture, the student provides a generic, broad response that emphasizes multicultural sensitivity and political considerations, which are not directly related to the core Christian understanding of the term. The answer should have delved more into the theological and spiritual implications of God's holiness and how it shapes the biblical narrative."
