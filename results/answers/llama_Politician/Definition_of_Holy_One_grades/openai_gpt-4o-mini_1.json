However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern of understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture. The emphasis on sensitivity to diverse perspectives, while important in a social context, detracts from a comprehensive Christian-specific worldview on the topic. The response could benefit from focusing more on the scriptural understanding of God's holiness and the role of the \"Holy One\" in illustrating this attribute."
