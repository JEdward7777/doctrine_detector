  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided a thoughtful and respectful exploration of the concept of the holy place in various cultural and faith contexts. While the focus was on inclusivity and diversity, it lacked a strong emphasis on the Christian-specific understanding of the holy place within the tabernacle or temple as the dwelling place of God. To improve the grade, the response could have more explicitly connected the concept of the holy place to its significance in Christian theology and the importance of God's presence in shaping the design and function of sacred spaces."
