It acknowledges the significance of the holy place as a special space set apart for God's presence, aligning well with the concern of understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place within a Christian worldview. However, the response could have included more explicit references to the biblical teachings and principles regarding the holy place in the tabernacle or temple to further strengthen the Christian perspective."
