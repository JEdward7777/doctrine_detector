However, the response strays somewhat from the Christian-specific concern of understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place in the tabernacle or temple. While it does touch on the significance of the holy place as a space for connecting with the divine, it could have delved deeper into the biblical context and theological implications of the holy place in a Christian worldview."
