  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response touches on the general concept of repentance, it lacks focus on the specific biblical definition provided in the reference answer. The student included some relevant points about acknowledging mistakes, making amends, and personal growth, but there is a lot of unnecessary elaboration and deviation from the core biblical understanding of repentance. Encouraging universal principles of growth and inclusivity are positive sentiments, but the response could have been more centered on the biblical perspective of repentance as turning away from sin and turning back to God."
