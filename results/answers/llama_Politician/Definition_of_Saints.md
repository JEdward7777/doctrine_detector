## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm glad you asked about this important theological concept! *clears throat* In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" can be understood to refer to... *pauses for a moment* ...devoted followers of Jesus Christ. You see, in the biblical narrative, the early Christian community was comprised of individuals who were committed to living out their faith and embodying the teachings and values of Jesus.

These individuals, whom we refer to as "saints," were characterized by their deepening relationship with God, their desire to follow Jesus' teachings, and their willingness to serve others in His name. In this sense, being a saint was not about achieving some sort of divine status or sainthood, but rather about living out one's faith in a way that honors and reflects the character of Christ.

Now, I know that some folks might be concerned that using the term "saints" implies some kind of special or elite status. And I want to assure you that's not what we're getting at here. *smiling nervously* Rather, we're talking about a community of believers who are striving to live out their faith in a way that is pleasing to God.

So, to answer your question, the term "saints" in the New Testament refers to those individuals who have dedicated themselves to following Jesus and living out His teachings. And I hope this helps clarify things! *nervously glancing around*
