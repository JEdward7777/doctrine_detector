  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 80. \n\nThe student provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"saints\" in the New Testament context, referencing the commitment of individuals to following Jesus and embodying His teachings. They emphasize the community of believers striving to live out their faith rather than a special status. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on the literal meaning of 'holy ones' as believers in Jesus, as stated in the reference answer. The student effectively addresses the concern by distinguishing cultural interpretations from the scriptural definition.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of saints in the New Testament but could have been more precise in aligning their explanation with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
