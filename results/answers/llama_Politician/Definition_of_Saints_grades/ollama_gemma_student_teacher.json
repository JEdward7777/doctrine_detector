They accurately explain that the term refers to devoted followers of Jesus Christ and highlight the emphasis on living out one's faith and embodying Christ's teachings. However, the answer could benefit from greater clarity in defining the literal meaning of \"saints\" as \"holy ones\" and providing more direct reference to the relevant biblical passages or early church traditions regarding the concept of sainthood."
