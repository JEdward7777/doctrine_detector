  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the term \"saints\" in the New Testament, highlighting the connection to believers in Jesus and the importance of living out one's faith. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical definition of saints and addresses the concern by emphasizing the distinction between cultural and scriptural interpretations. However, there is some nervousness evident in the presentation, which could be improved for a more confident delivery."
