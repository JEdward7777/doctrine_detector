The answer is overly focused on general spirituality and personal growth rather than on the biblical teachings of sanctification. There is a need for a deeper engagement with Biblical references and a more explicit connection to the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life. The tone and approach should align more closely with presenting the truth of sanctification as revealed in the Bible without diluting it for the sake of inclusivity."
