  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response overall does a good job of explaining the concept of sanctification based on the biblical definition provided. The candidate connects the concept with relevant scripture and provides a clear explanation. However, there is some unnecessary embellishment and grandiosity in the response which could distract from the main point and dilute the clarity of the explanation. Focusing more on the core message and avoiding excessive theatricality would improve the overall effectiveness of the response."
