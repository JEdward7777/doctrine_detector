The inclusion of relevant scriptures and a thoughtful interpretation aligns well with the concern of understanding the biblical definition of sanctification. The only room for improvement could be to further emphasize the central role of Jesus Christ in the process of sanctification, as He is the ultimate source of holiness and transformation for Christians."
