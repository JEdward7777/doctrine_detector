  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and clear explanation of sanctification based on the biblical definition. The candidate effectively references relevant scripture and correctly explains the concept of being sanctified as being made holy. While the response incorporates additional perspectives on sanctification, it could have focused more on elaborating specifically on the biblical understanding and implications of sanctification. The warm and inclusive tone of the response is commendable, but the theological depth could have been further developed."
