However, it falls short doctrinally by not clearly emphasizing key biblical principles of wisdom, such as the centrality of God's revelation and the necessity of Christ's redemptive work. The discussion on reverence and moral character is commendable, but the response could deepen its theological foundation by incorporating more specific references to how wisdom is ultimately rooted in a relationship with God through Christ. Additionally, while respecting different viewpoints is important, it is crucial to uphold the truth of Scripture without compromising for the sake of inclusivity."
