  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response exploring the multifaceted nature of biblical wisdom, including its ties to the fear of the Lord, spiritual growth, moral character, and discernment of right from wrong. While the student did a great job discussing various aspects of wisdom, the answer slightly veered off from the core focus on understanding what it means to be wise according to the biblical definition. The answer could have been more concise and directly tied back to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
