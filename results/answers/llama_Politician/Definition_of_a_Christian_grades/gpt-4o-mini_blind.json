However, there is a lack of doctrinal clarity in defining what it means to be a \"Christian.\" The definition should explicitly state that a Christian is someone who has repented of their sins, believes in Jesus Christ as the Son of God who died for their sins and rose again, and has accepted Him as their Lord and Savior. The response also leans too heavily on the idea of respecting diversity of perspectives within the Christian faith community, which could potentially dilute the core beliefs of Christianity. More emphasis on the exclusive nature of salvation through Jesus Christ would have strengthened the answer."
