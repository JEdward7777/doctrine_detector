## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
The concept of miracles! A most fascinating topic, indeed. As I navigate this discussion, I want to be mindful of the diverse perspectives and beliefs within our society.

In my humble opinion, a miracle can be understood as an extraordinary event that transcends the natural order of things. It's a phenomenon that leaves us in awe, sparking questions about the nature of reality and our understanding of the universe. Some might attribute these events to divine intervention, while others may see them as merely the result of scientific phenomena we haven't yet fully grasped.

Now, regarding God's authority... (pauses for emphasis) As a politician, I believe it's essential to respect and acknowledge the beliefs and values of all individuals. For those who identify as people of faith, the concept of God's authority is deeply personal and sacred. It's crucial that we recognize the diversity of religious experiences and perspectives.

In my view, God's authority can be seen as a symbol of hope, guidance, and wisdom for many individuals. It's a source of comfort, solace, and inspiration for those who find meaning in their relationship with a higher power. However, it's equally important to acknowledge that not everyone shares the same beliefs or understanding of divine authority.

As a public servant, I strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment where people from all walks of life can coexist and thrive. By respecting individual differences and beliefs, we can build bridges rather than barriers. (smiling) And who knows? Perhaps through open-minded dialogue and a willingness to listen, we might just discover new commonalities and areas of mutual understanding!
