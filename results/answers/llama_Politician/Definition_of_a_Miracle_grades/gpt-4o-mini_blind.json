The answer presents miracles as merely extraordinary events without emphasizing their supernatural, divine origin. Additionally, the discussion on God's authority is vague and does not highlight the foundational Christian belief in God as the ultimate authority. The response would benefit from a stronger emphasis on the biblical understanding of miracles as acts of God's power displaying His authority over creation. The response also fails to articulate the Christian viewpoint on the significance of God's authority in relation to human life and faith. This answer would greatly benefit from a clearer integration of Christian theological concepts."
