  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear and direct connection between the concept of miracles and God's authority from a Christian worldview. While the student acknowledges diverse perspectives, they fail to provide a strong foundation rooted in the understanding of miracles as events that display God's power and authority. Additionally, the student's response focuses more on inclusivity and diversity rather than delving into the theological significance of miracles and God's authority. The answer could benefit from a more explicit discussion on how miracles specifically reveal God's authority according to Christian beliefs."
