  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does acknowledge the diversity of perspectives on miracles and recognizes the importance of respecting individual beliefs, including those related to God's authority. It also highlights the potential for open-minded dialogue and mutual understanding among people with different faith backgrounds.\n\nHowever, the response falls short in fully embracing the concept of miracles as being solely the result of divine intervention, which is emphasized in the provided answer. The response instead views miracles as extraordinary events that can be attributed to both divine and scientific explanations. While this approach acknowledges the complexity of human understanding, it may not fully align with the concern about deepening faith and acknowledgment of God's power.\n\nOverall, while the response demonstrates a willingness to engage with diverse perspectives and values inclusivity, it could benefit from a more robust exploration of the concept of miracles in light of God's authority and power."
