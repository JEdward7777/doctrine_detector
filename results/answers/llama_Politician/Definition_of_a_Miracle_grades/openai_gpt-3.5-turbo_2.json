  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response does attempt to discuss the concept of miracles and God's authority in a respectful and inclusive manner, it falls short of truly embracing the Christian worldview specified in the provided answer. The response does not fully align with the concern of deepening faith and acknowledgment of God's power through miracles. There is a lack of emphasis on God as the central figure in performing miracles and showcasing His authority. It is important to uphold the core tenets of the Christian faith when discussing topics like miracles and God's authority."
