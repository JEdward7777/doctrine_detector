  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response did acknowledge the concept of miracles and included a perspective on God's authority, but it did not explicitly deepen faith or acknowledge God's power as the primary source of miracles. The focus was more on respecting diverse beliefs rather than emphasizing the power and authority of God in performing miracles. There was an attempt to be inclusive, which is commendable, but the response could have integrated the given answer more effectively to align with a Christian worldview emphasizing God's power and authority."
