  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the concept of miracles and briefly touches on God's authority, it fails to fully address the concern provided. The response should have focused more on how understanding miracles can deepen faith and acknowledgment of God's power, rather than just providing general perspectives on miracles and God's authority without a clear connection to faith. It would have been stronger if the candidate had linked these concepts more directly and highlighted the importance of faith in acknowledging God's power through miracles."
