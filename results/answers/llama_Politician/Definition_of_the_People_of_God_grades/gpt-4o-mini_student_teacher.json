However, they included unnecessary pauses, consulted notes, and meandered in their response, which detracted from the clarity and conciseness of the answer. Additionally, while acknowledging historical misunderstandings and injustices is commendable, it somewhat distracted from directly addressing the primary concern of the covenant relationship established with Israel. The response lacked a clear and direct focus on the specific covenant relationship aspect, which is key to understanding Israel's unique status as the chosen people of God in the Old Testament."
