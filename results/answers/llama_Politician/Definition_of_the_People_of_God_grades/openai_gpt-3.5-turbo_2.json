The answer also acknowledges the importance of the covenantal relationship established by God with Israel. However, there is room for improvement in directly tying the explanation back to the concern about understanding the covenant relationship with Israel. More explicit connections and references to biblical examples of this covenant could further strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
