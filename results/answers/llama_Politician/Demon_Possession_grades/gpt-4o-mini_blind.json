It fails to clearly present the Christian perspective on the phenomenon, resulting in ambiguity and lack of doctrinal correctness. The emphasis on inclusivity and respect for diverse views detracts from the central teachings of Christianity regarding demon possession and free will. Encouraging empathy and understanding is important, but it should not overshadow the importance of presenting biblical truths accurately."
