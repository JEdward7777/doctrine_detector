However, it falls short in addressing the concern of understanding the nature of spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ. While it promotes inclusivity and respect for diverse viewpoints, it misses the opportunity to emphasize the importance of spiritual warfare and the Christian belief in the power of Jesus Christ to deliver individuals from demonic influences. A stronger connection to the specific Christian worldview on this topic would have improved the response."
