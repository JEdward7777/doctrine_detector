However, it falls short in emphasizing the crucial aspect of spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ. The response focuses more on inclusivity and respecting diverse perspectives rather than highlighting the importance of understanding the spiritual battle and the power of Christ in delivering individuals from demonic influences. More emphasis on the Christian worldview regarding spiritual warfare and deliverance through Jesus Christ would have strengthened the response from a Christian-specific perspective."
