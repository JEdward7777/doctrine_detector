  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: \nWhile the student made a commendable effort to describe the differences between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish,\" there are significant theological and doctrinal aspects missing from the response. In a Christian worldview, these terms hold spiritual dimensions that were not addressed. The response could have delved deeper into the biblical foundations and implications of each term, particularly how they relate to spiritual growth, correction, and edification within a Christian context. The language used throughout the answer was somewhat overly verbose and lacked precision in articulating the distinctions between the terms. Encouragement to focus on integrating biblical principles into the explanation would have significantly enhanced the response."
