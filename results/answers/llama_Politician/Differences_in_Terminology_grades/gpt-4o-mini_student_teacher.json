  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear connection to scripture in defining the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish'. While the student provided some analysis on the nuances of each term, it did not align closely with the Christian perspective of using different forms of encouragement as outlined in scripture. The response could be improved by integrating biblical examples or principles to illustrate the appropriate use of these terms in a Christian context."
