The writer shows awareness of the importance of using language thoughtfully and considerately, aligning with Scriptural principles of speaking truth in love (Ephesians 4:15) and building others up (1 Thessalonians 5:11). The response could have further emphasized the biblical basis for using these forms of encouragement, referencing specific verses or principles from the Bible to strengthen the connection to a Christian worldview."
