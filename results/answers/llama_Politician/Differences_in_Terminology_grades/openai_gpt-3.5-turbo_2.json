The explanation aligns well with a Christian worldview, highlighting the importance of encouraging others towards what is right, inspiring and comforting them, and also gently correcting or warning about wrong behavior, all in line with biblical principles. The response could have further emphasized the scriptural basis for such forms of encouragement to strengthen the connection to a Christian perspective."
