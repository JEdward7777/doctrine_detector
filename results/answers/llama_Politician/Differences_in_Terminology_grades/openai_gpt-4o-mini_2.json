  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and well-articulated explanation of the differences between \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish,\" aligning with the provided answer. The inclusion of examples and considerations for inclusive language is commendable. However, to improve the grade, a stronger integration of scriptural references regarding encouragement could have been beneficial in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of encouragement rooted in love, truth, and edification per biblical teachings could further strengthen the response."
