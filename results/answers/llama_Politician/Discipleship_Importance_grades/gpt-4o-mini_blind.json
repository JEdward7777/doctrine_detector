The student correctly mentions some qualities that the apostles possessed, but fails to articulate the theological reasons behind why Jesus specifically selected these individuals. The response also somewhat minimizes the significance of Jesus' deliberate choice in selecting the apostles, which is a crucial aspect of Christian teaching. Additionally, the answer veers towards a more general moral lesson on inclusivity rather than focusing on the specific biblical context of Jesus' selection of the Twelve Apostles. Further emphasis on the divine purpose and significance behind Jesus' choice would have strengthened the overall theological accuracy of the response."
