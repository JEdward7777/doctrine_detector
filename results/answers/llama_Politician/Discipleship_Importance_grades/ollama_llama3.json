  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively answers the question about the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, providing specific examples and insights into their unique qualities and contributions. The writer also addresses potential concerns about Jesus' choice of apostles, offering a nuanced understanding of the historical context and emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and diversity within the early Christian movement.\n\nThe response does not fully align with the provided answer, as it goes beyond simply stating that the twelve were chosen by Jesus to be his closest disciples. Instead, the writer provides more detailed information about the apostles' roles and characteristics, which adds depth and richness to their understanding of the apostles' significance.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response could further emphasize the biblical accounts and provide even more specific examples from the Gospels or Acts to support its claims. However, overall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a thoughtful and informed approach to understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament."
