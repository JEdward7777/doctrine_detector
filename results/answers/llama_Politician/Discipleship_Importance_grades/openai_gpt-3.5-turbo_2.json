  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful reflection on the significance of the Twelve Apostles in the context of the New Testament, emphasizing their unique qualities and roles in spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church. The student effectively incorporates biblical accounts and historical context to support their points. However, there is a slight deviation from directly addressing the concern about the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament, as the response also touches on the diversity and contributions of the apostles. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding and application of a Christian worldview to the topic."
