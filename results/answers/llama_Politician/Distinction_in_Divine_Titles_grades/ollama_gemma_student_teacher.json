  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 95/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is an exceptional response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the significance of nuanced translation in religious contexts. The student clearly articulates the importance of respecting cultural and historical context, and avoids simplistic equivalences between religious concepts. The inclusion of references to the Tetragrammaton and the use of alternative titles adds depth and accuracy to the translation discussion."
