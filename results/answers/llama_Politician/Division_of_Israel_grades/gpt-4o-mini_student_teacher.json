  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the historical events following King Solomon's reign, including the division of Israel into two kingdoms. However, there was some unnecessary hesitation and nervousness in their response, which could have been improved upon. Additionally, while they mentioned the Babylonian exile, they did not directly connect it to the division of the Israelites as specifically requested in the concern. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in clarity and focus."
