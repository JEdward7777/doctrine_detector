  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides some accurate historical context regarding the division of Israel into two kingdoms after King Solomon's reign. However, the grade is lowered due to the excessive use of nervousness, awkwardness, and hesitation in the response, which detracts from the confidence and clarity needed when discussing spiritual and historical significance from a Christian worldview. The response could benefit from a more assertive and confident tone to effectively convey the understanding of the division of the Israelites."
