The writer acknowledges the responsibility given to humans by God to have dominion over the earth while emphasizing the importance of exercising this authority with stewardship and respect. The inclusion of scriptural references and a call for interfaith cooperation adds depth and richness to the discussion. A well-rounded and thoughtful perspective presented with clarity and sensitivity to the concern raised."
