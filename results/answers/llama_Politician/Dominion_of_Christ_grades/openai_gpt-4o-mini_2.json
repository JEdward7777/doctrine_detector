While the emphasis on love, compassion, and shared human values is commendable, the connection to the authority of Christ in all aspects of life, particularly within the realm of faith, could have been more explicit and central to the discussion. A clearer integration of how recognizing Christ's dominion impacts faith directly would have further strengthened the response."
