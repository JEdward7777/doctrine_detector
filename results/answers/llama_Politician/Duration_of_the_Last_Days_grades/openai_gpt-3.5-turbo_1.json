While it correctly acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the duration of the \"last days,\" it could have gone further in addressing how this uncertainty may impact Christians' faith and conduct in light of the anticipation of Christ's return. Overall, a solid effort in integrating Christian principles with a broader message of unity and compassion."
