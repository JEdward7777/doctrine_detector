While it promotes cooperation and mutual respect, it does not directly address how this uncertainty can impact how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. A stronger connection between addressing the concern and providing guidance on living out one's faith amidst this uncertainty would improve the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
