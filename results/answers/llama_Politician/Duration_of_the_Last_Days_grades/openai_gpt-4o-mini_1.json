It acknowledges that there are varying interpretations within Christianity regarding this timeframe. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern raised about the impact of uncertainty on how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. Encouraging unity, compassion, and cooperation is positive, but a more direct engagement with the concern would have strengthened the response."
