  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided relevant biblical references and explanations on how the Holy Spirit empowers Christians, there is a notable lack of emphasis on the core aspects of leading, teaching, comforting, and proclaiming the Gospel as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, the response did not directly address the concern about the importance of awareness of the Holy Spirit's empowerment for effective ministry and living out one's faith. There could have been a stronger connection made between the biblical references provided and how they align with the overarching role of the Holy Spirit in empowering Christians."
