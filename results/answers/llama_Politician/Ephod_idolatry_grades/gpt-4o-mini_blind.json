However, the answer fails to address the doctrinal significance of Gideon's creation of a gold ephod and the subsequent idolatry of the Israelites. It does not emphasize the biblical teaching against idolatry and the consequences of straying from true worship of God. A stronger focus on the theological implications of the story would have improved the overall analysis."
