The concern regarding the importance of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith is effectively addressed, conveying the significance of maintaining true worship. The integration of Christian principles such as humility, cultural sensitivity, and reliance on divine providence enhances the response and aligns well with a Christian worldview."
