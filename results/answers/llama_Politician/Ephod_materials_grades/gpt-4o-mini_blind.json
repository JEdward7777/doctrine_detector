  "grade": 55.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: While the response attempts to be inclusive and respectful, it falls short in providing a doctrinally accurate answer regarding the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod. The focus should have been on providing biblically accurate information rather than on emphasizing cultural sensitivity. The grade reflects the need for improvement in prioritizing doctrinal correctness in responses related to religious topics."
