  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed and thoughtful response, their answer did not accurately specify the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod as per the teacher's reference answer. The student focused more on the symbolic significance of the materials rather than directly answering the question. However, their response did demonstrate a commendable effort to be respectful and inclusive of various traditions and cultures."
