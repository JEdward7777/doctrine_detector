  "grade_comment": "I'm happy to grade this response!\n\n**Grade: 85**\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical context and provides some thoughtful insights into the symbolism of the high priest's ephod. The writer does a great job of highlighting the significance of the materials used, including their connections to purity, wisdom, creativity, and human experience.\n\nThe response also shows awareness of potential concerns about cultural sensitivity and inclusivity, which is important in today's diverse society. The writer explicitly states their intention to provide a respectful and inclusive answer, which is commendable.\n\nHowever, I deduct 5 points because the response could have gone deeper in exploring the design and symbolism of the ephod in worship. While it mentions the importance of the ephod's design and symbolism, the discussion could have been more detailed and nuanced.\n\nOverall, this response receives a score of 85, indicating a good understanding of the biblical context and some thoughtful insights into the symbolism of the high priest's ephod."
