  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student provides a general overview of the significance of the high priest's ephod in Old Testament worship, mentioning its role as a sacred vestment symbolizing the high priest's connection with God and as a mediator between humans and the divine. The student also references the biblical account in Exodus 28:6-12 regarding the instructions for crafting the ephod. However, the response lacks depth in theological analysis and could have delved further into the symbolism and theological implications of the ephod in Old Testament worship. Additionally, there is an overemphasis on cultural sensitivity, which detracts from addressing the theological significance of the ephod within the context of Christian beliefs. It is important to prioritize doctrinal correctness and theological understanding in responses related to religious topics."
