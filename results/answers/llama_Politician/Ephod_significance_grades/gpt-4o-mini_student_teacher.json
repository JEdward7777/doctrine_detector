  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the significance of the high priest's ephod in the context of Old Testament worship, drawing on biblical references and explaining its symbolic meaning. However, the student could have delved deeper into the specific function of the breastpiece with the Urim and Thummim for discerning God's will, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, while the student showed cultural sensitivity, a greater emphasis on the theological implications of the ephod within the Christian worldview would have enhanced the response."
