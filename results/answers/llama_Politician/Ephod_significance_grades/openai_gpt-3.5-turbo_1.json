It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding the ephod in comprehending Old Testament priesthood and worship practices. However, there is room for improvement in connecting this explanation to a broader Christian worldview perspective, such as emphasizing the symbolic and foreshadowing aspects of the ephod in relation to Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity."
