However, while the student displays sensitivity towards religious discussions and emphasizes the importance of cultural respect, there is a lack of depth in connecting the ephod to the broader context of Old Testament priesthood and worship practices. The response could have delved further into the implications of the ephod on the religious life of the Israelites to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its role in Old Testament worship."
