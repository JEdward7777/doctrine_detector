The response appropriately addressed the concern by elucidating how understanding the role of the ephod contributes to comprehending Old Testament priesthood and worship practices. However, the initial acknowledgment of cultural sensitivity and the repeated emphasis on it throughout the response could have been more aligned with a Christian worldview focus on truth and understanding the Biblical context rather than a general emphasis on cultural sensitivity alone."
