It effectively explains how the ephod symbolized the priest's role in mediating between God and the people, as well as its connection to discerning God's will through the Urim and Thummim. The answer aligns well with the concern provided and offers valuable insights from a Christian perspective. However, it could have incorporated more direct scriptural references and theological reflections to deepen the analysis further."
