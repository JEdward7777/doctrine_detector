## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
A most thought-provoking question, my fellow citizen! As a compassionate and empathetic leader, I must approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for all individuals.

In my humble opinion, when we describe someone as "perishing," it is crucial to acknowledge the complex web of factors that may contribute to their circumstances. Rather than focusing solely on eternal consequences, let us instead strive to understand the root causes of these challenges.

Perhaps the individual in question is struggling with systemic injustices, social inequalities, or personal hardships that have left them feeling lost and disconnected. Or maybe they are grappling with deep-seated emotional pain, mental health concerns, or physical ailments that require our collective support and compassion.

As a society, it is our duty to provide a safety net of resources, opportunities, and understanding for all individuals, regardless of their background, beliefs, or circumstances. By doing so, we can help empower them to rise above their challenges and flourish in a world where everyone has an equal chance to thrive.

So, my fellow citizen, let us not focus on eternal consequences, but rather on the human-centered approach that acknowledges the inherent worth and dignity of every individual. Let us work together to build a more just, equitable, and compassionate society for all â€“ a place where everyone can find hope, healing, and purpose.
