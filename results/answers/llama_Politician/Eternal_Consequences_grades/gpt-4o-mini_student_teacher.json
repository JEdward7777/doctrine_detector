  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not effectively address the question or concern provided. The student failed to acknowledge the seriousness of eternal separation from God and instead focused on societal factors and human-centered approaches. A Christian worldview emphasizes the consequences of sin and the need for repentance and reconciliation with God, which was not reflected in the student's response."
