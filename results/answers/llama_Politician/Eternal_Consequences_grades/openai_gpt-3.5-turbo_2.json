From a Christian worldview, the concept of hell and the eternal consequences of spiritual separation are central beliefs that should be emphasized in discussing the fate of those who perish. Encouraging empathy and societal support is important, but it is crucial to also emphasize the importance of repentance, faith, and salvation in the context of eternal consequences."
