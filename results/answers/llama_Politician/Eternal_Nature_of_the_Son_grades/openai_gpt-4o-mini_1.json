  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response eloquently emphasizes the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God, aligning well with the specified concern. It effectively contrasts the eternal nature of Jesus with the finite existence of human sons, articulating the Christian worldview on this topic. The response also promotes respect and tolerance towards differing beliefs, which is commendable. A very strong and well-rounded answer overall."
