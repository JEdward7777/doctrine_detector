  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of eternal punishment in hell within Christian theology. The student acknowledges the complexity of the topic and approaches it with sensitivity and compassion. They correctly emphasize the seriousness of sin and the redemptive power of Jesus Christ. While the student could have delved deeper into specific biblical references and theological arguments supporting God's justice through eternal punishment, overall, this response shows a solid grasp of the subject matter and presents it in a thoughtful and respectful manner."
