  "grade_comment": "Grade: 72\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful analysis of the significance of the encounter between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch in the context of the early church, focusing on inclusivity, missionary zeal, cultural sensitivity, and universalism. However, there is a lack of emphasis on key doctrinal aspects such as the central message of salvation through Christ alone and the Holy Spirit's role in the eunuch's conversion. Encouragement to incorporate more scriptural references and theological depth in future responses."
