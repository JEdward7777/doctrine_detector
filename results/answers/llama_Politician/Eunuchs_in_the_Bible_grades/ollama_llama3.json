The writer provides a nuanced explanation of Jesus' words, highlighting the importance of self-denial and dedication to God's will. They also recognize the complexity of interpreting ancient texts through modern lenses.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by exploring different reasons for living a celibate life, including choosing to renounce worldly attachments in order to focus on spiritual pursuits. The writer shows empathy towards individuals who may choose this path and emphasizes the importance of inclusivity, respect, and understanding.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more directly addressing the biblical perspective on celibacy, as stated in the answer. While the writer mentions self-denial and dedication, they could have further developed this idea and its implications for understanding different reasons for living a life without marriage. Additionally, some minor points of clarification or expansion on certain ideas could strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written, informative, and demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical passage and its relevance to contemporary issues."
