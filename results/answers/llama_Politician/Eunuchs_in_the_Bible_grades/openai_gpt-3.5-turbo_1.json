  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful interpretation of Matthew 19:12 within its cultural and biblical context. The candidate effectively explores the concept of celibacy and its relationship to living a life dedicated to God. The emphasis on approaching biblical passages with humility and respecting diverse experiences is commendable. However, there could be a clearer connection between the initial answer and the ultimate discussion on celibacy. Overall, the response demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the biblical perspective on celibacy."
