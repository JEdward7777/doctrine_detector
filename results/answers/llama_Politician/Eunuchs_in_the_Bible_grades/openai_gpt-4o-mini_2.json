  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and the reasons for living a life without marriage based on the given answer and concern. The student effectively connects the concept of celibacy to the passage in Matthew 19:12 and provides a thoughtful interpretation within the Christian worldview. The response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications of celibacy and its significance in the context of Christian teachings. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the scriptural foundation for celibacy and its relationship to discipleship would strengthen the argument from a Christian perspective."
