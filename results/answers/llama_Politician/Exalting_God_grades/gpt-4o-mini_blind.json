The emphasis on inclusivity and personal choice regarding how one exalts God may lead to a relativistic interpretation of faith. The focus on creating a tolerant environment, while important, should be secondary to proclaiming the truth of the Gospel. The response would benefit from a clearer articulation of the biblical teachings on exalting God and the exclusive nature of salvation through Jesus Christ."
