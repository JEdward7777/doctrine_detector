  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response, while well-intentioned and thoughtful, veers off from the specific Christian understanding of exalting God. The student does not clearly define or emphasize the importance of worship, prayer, and living according to God's will in exalting Him. While inclusivity and diversity are important values, the focus should have remained on the core aspects of exalting God from a Christian perspective."
