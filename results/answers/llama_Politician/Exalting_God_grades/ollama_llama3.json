  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a great job of emphasizing the importance of exalting God in daily life, and it provides several concrete examples of what that might look like (e.g., acts of worship, prayer, community service). The response also highlights the value of inclusivity and respect for those who may not share one's faith.\n\nThe only area where this response falls short is in its departure from the original definition provided. While the original definition emphasized \"worship, prayer, and living according to His will,\" this response expands that definition to include a broader range of activities (e.g., community service, treating others with kindness). While these activities may be important expressions of one's faith, they are not necessarily direct correlates of exalting God in the classical sense.\n\nOverall, however, this is a thoughtful and well-written response that does a good job of exploring the importance of exalting God in daily life."
