  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response beautifully emphasizes the importance of exalting God in daily life by acknowledging His presence in all aspects of existence, recognizing the diversity of ways in which individuals may express their faith, promoting an environment of religious freedom, and highlighting the values of gratitude, humility, and social responsibility. The concern regarding understanding the importance of exalting God above all else is addressed effectively throughout the response, although the initial answer could have been more explicitly tied back to this central theme for a more direct alignment. Overall, the response reflects a strong Christian worldview in advocating for the exaltation of God in daily life."
