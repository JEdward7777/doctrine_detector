The Christian worldview places a strong emphasis on prioritizing God above all things, and while respecting diversity and promoting religious freedom is important, the core message of exalting God as the highest priority could have been emphasized more clearly. The response also lacks a clear distinction between the uniqueness of Christian faith in exalting God and general spirituality."
