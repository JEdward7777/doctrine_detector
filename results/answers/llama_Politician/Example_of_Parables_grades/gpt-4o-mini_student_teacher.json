  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful analysis of the parable of the Prodigal Son, highlighting its message of love, mercy, and redemption. However, the student strayed from the reference answer, which focused on the Good Samaritan parable, in addressing the concern about recognizing the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables. The student's explanation was insightful and relevant to today's context, but could have been more directly aligned with the specified concern."
