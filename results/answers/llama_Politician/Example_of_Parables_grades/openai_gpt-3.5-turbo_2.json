  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively discusses the parable of the Prodigal Son and its message of love, mercy, and redemption, connecting it to themes of forgiveness and reconciliation. The student successfully addresses the concern by recognizing the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. The only area for improvement could be further exploration of the Christian theological implications or deeper engagement with scripture, but overall, this is a strong response from a Christian worldview perspective."
