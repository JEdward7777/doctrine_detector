  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith. They provided relevant examples from the Bible that illustrate instances of demon possession and approached the topic with sensitivity and respect. The incorporation of historical and cultural contexts adds depth to their analysis. However, the student could have enhanced their response by directly referencing the examples specified in the teacher's answer to align more closely with the given question."
