  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided well-known examples from the Bible illustrating guilt, such as Adam and Eve, King David, and Peter, but the examples did not directly address the concern of how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence or the need for divine judgment. The examples given by the student were relevant but did not fully align with the specific concern raised in the question. The student did a good job of explaining the stories and their implications for guilt, but the answer could have been stronger by directly addressing the concern provided in the prompt."
