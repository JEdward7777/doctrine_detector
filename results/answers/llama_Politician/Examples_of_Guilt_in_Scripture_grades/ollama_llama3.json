  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response provides some biblical examples of guilt, it does not directly address the concern about how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment. The provided answer only mentions Pilate declaring Jesus innocent and a robber acknowledging their own guilt compared to Jesus, which do not explicitly illustrate this concern. The response's focus on biblical accounts of Adam, David, Peter, and Zacchaeus, while relevant to understanding guilt, does not adequately address the specified concern. To improve the grade, the response should provide more direct examples that demonstrate how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, highlighting the need for divine judgment."
