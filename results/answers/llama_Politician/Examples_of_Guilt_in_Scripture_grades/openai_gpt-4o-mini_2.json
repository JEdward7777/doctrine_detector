  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a thoughtful exploration of the concept of guilt in the Bible through various examples, including Adam and Eve, King David, Peter, and Zacchaeus. The examples chosen effectively illustrated the different aspects of guilt as a theological theme. While the response did not directly address the concern about divine judgment, it did provide valuable insights into how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence within a biblical framework, earning a high grade for its depth and relevance."
