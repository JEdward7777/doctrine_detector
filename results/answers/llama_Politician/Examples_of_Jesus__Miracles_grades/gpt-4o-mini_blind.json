  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The answer attempts to approach the topic of Jesus' miracles with sensitivity and inclusivity, which is commendable. However, the response falls short doctrinally by not affirming the significance of Jesus' miracles from a Christian worldview. The focus on unity and inclusivity, while important, should not compromise the essential teachings of Christian faith. The answer should have emphasized the miracles as concrete demonstrations of Jesus' divinity, power, and compassion, as well as their role in revealing the Kingdom of God. The grade is lowered due to the lack of doctrinal correctness in presenting these pivotal events in Jesus' ministry."
