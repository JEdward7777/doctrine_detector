The response lacked a clear connection between the miracles and Jesus' divinity and God's kingdom, which are central to understanding Jesus' identity as the Son of God within a Christian worldview. The student did show respect for different beliefs and faiths, which is commendable, but the focus should have been more on the Christian perspective in this context. "
