The examples chosen align well with the concern provided. The response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern in more detail and emphasizing the importance of recognizing these miracles not only for belief in Jesus as the Son of God but also for understanding His redemptive work and the Kingdom of God. Additionally, framing the discussion within a Christian worldview and explicitly connecting the miracles to Christian faith would have strengthened the response."
