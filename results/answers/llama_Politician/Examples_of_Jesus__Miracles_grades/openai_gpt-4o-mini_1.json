However, the response lacks a direct connection to the concern highlighted. It could have incorporated more explicit references to Jesus' divinity and the role of these miracles in affirming His identity as the Son of God, according to Christian belief. Additionally, while promoting unity and inclusivity is important, from a Christian worldview, emphasizing the unique and foundational nature of Jesus' miracles in affirming His divinity and our faith in Him is crucial."
