  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of faith in receiving and trusting God's promises, similar to the given answer. However, the majority of the response focuses on being sensitive and respectful towards different beliefs and spiritual journeys, rather than directly addressing the specific concern provided. While promoting understanding and empathy is commendable, the response could have more directly tied these aspects to the encouragement of believers to trust in God's word in their personal lives. Therefore, the grade is slightly lower as the central concern was not fully addressed."
