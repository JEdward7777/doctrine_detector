The response lacks a clear connection to recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life, which is the specified concern. Additionally, the emphasis on individual interpretation and personal journeys without a distinct focus on biblical teachings could be seen as relativistic. Encouraging diversity in expressing faith is good, but without grounding in biblical truth, it can lead to a lack of accountability in aligning behaviors with Christian beliefs."
