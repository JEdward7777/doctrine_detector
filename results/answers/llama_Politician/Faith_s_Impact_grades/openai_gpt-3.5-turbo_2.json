However, it lacked a clear connection to the given answer that emphasizes the Holy Spirit's presence and the resulting good spiritual fruits or behaviors as evidence of genuine faith. While the response highlighted aspects of compassion, empathy, kindness, and serving others, it could have integrated more directly with the idea of the Holy Spirit's transformative work in shaping behavior and producing spiritual fruits in daily life. It is crucial from a Christian worldview to emphasize the impact of the Holy Spirit in manifesting genuine faith through visible spiritual fruits."
