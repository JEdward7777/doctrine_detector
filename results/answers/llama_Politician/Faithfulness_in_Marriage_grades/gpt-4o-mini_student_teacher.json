  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response contains some good points about striving for honesty and compassion in relationships, but it lacks depth in directly addressing the biblical teachings on faithfulness in marriage regarding adultery. The student could have referenced specific passages like the teacher's answer to provide a more focused and accurate response from a Christian perspective. The student's answer also veers off track by introducing political commentary and general relationship advice that is not directly related to the biblical teachings on faithfulness in marriage. To improve the grade, the student should provide a more direct and biblically grounded response to the question."
