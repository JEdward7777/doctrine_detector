They effectively cite relevant passages from Matthew and acknowledge the complexities of human relationships while upholding the sanctity of the covenant. Their emphasis on promoting healthy relationships, built on trust and open communication, is commendable. However, the response could benefit from a more direct connection to the specific concern of maintaining integrity and faithfulness in Christian marriages."
