  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response touches on various aspects of faithfulness to God and emphasizes respect for diverse perspectives, there is a lack of clarity and specificity in defining faithfulness according to the biblical definition. The answer would have been stronger if it focused more on living according to God's teachings, loyalty through obedience, and perseverance in doing His will, as outlined in the reference answer. The student's emphasis on inclusivity and diversity is commendable but may detract from the core Christian understanding of faithfulness."
