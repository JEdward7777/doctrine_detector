  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear understanding of the term \"favoritism\" and how it can impact relationships with others. The student effectively communicates the negative consequences of favoritism, such as exclusion, resentment, and mistrust, as well as the importance of approaching situations with inclusivity and respect for all individuals. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of aligning our actions with biblical principles of loving others as ourselves and treating all individuals as equals in the eyes of God. Additionally, incorporating specific scriptural references or examples could have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response."
