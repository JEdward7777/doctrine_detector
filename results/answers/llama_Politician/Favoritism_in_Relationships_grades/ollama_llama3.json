  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear definition of favoritism, acknowledges its potential negative consequences, and suggests ways to minimize it in relationships. The emphasis on treating everyone with respect, empathy, and understanding is also in line with Christian values. However, the response does not directly address the concern about avoiding favoritism and ensuring fair and loving treatment of all individuals. While the tone is inclusive and encouraging of unity, the connection to Christian principles could be more explicit.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response could provide more direct application to the biblical teachings on fairness, equality, and loving one's neighbor as oneself (e.g., Galatians 2:6-10; James 1:9-11). Additionally, it could offer more concrete examples or practical tips for avoiding favoritism in everyday life."
