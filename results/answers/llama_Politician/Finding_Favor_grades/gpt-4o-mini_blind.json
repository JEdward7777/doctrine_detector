The mention of divine approval and blessing is appropriate. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the sovereignty and grace of God in granting favor, as it is not solely dependent on human actions. Additionally, the use of \"nervous smile\" as a repeated phrase detracts from the professionalism of the answer. Overall, a solid explanation but with room for improvement in theological depth and presentation."
