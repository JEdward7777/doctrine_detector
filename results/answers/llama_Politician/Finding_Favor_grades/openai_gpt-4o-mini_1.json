The discussion of biblical examples such as Noah and Moses further enhances the understanding of this concept. Additionally, the clarification that divine approval is often involved highlights the significance of seeking approval in a Christian worldview. This response aligns well with the concern that Christians should cultivate relationships characterized by mutual approval and blessing."
