However, it lacks doctrinal specificity and clarity in explaining the biblical concept of \"finding grace in the eyes of God.\" The focus on subjective experiences and personal interpretations may lead to a dilution of the Christian understanding of grace as a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ. Furthermore, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical foundation of grace and the role of Christ as the ultimate expression of God's grace towards humanity."
