  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer does not clearly define or address the Christian-specific understanding of \"finding grace in the eyes of God\" in relation to seeking and recognizing God's favor in their life. While the student's response conveys a thoughtful reflection on the concept of grace in a more general sense, it lacks specificity and depth in terms of the Christian worldview. There is a need for a clearer connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher and a more focused exploration of how grace is understood within the Christian faith."
