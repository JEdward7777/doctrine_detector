  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response delves into a broad and inclusive exploration of finding grace in the eyes of God, emphasizing the universal themes of acceptance, forgiveness, and love. However, it falls short in directly addressing the specified concern of seeking and recognizing God's favor in one's life, as it remains more abstract and metaphorical in its approach. To improve the grade, a clearer connection between the defined meaning of finding grace in the eyes of God and practical steps or attitudes for seeking and recognizing God's favor in one's life could be provided."
