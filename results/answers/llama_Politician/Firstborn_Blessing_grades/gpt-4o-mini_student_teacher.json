  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75. \n\nWhile the student's response demonstrates a deep reflection on the concept of birthright in a Christian family context and provides thoughtful applications, the answer lacks a direct connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student focused more on broader themes and lessons from the story of Jacob and Esau without directly tying it back to the concept of leading one's family in faith and demonstrating stewardship and inheritance, as outlined in the reference answer. \n\nOverall, the student's insights are valuable and well-organized, but the answer could be strengthened by more explicitly addressing the specific concern raised in the reference answer."
