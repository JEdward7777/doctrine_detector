  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of both \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" in Christian teachings and attempts to differentiate between the two concepts. However, the student's answer lacks clarity and a clear stance on the relationship between the two terms, as well as a clear connection to the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the student's emphasis on inclusivity and avoiding controversy detracts from providing a focused and precise theological analysis from a Christian worldview. The response could benefit from a stronger alignment with the specific concern provided."
