The mention of inclusivity and diversity of spiritual beliefs may dilute the Christian-specific focus on the fruits of the Holy Spirit. Encouraging positive virtues is commendable, but a stronger emphasis on the unique significance of these fruits within a Christian worldview would further strengthen the response."
