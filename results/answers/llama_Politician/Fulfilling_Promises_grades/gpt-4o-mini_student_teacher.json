  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-researched answer, incorporating key Christian teachings on the importance of keeping promises before God. They demonstrated an understanding of the significance of this aspect in Christian faith. However, the answer could have been more focused on directly addressing the concern posed and providing a more concise and specific explanation within a Christian worldview. The inclusion of other religious perspectives, while important for a broader dialogue, slightly detracted from the depth of the Christian viewpoint on promise-keeping."
