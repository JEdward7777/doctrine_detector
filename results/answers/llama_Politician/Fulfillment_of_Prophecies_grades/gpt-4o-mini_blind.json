It is overly focused on inclusivity and diversity of beliefs, which dilutes the doctrinal clarity needed in explaining this theological topic from a Christian worldview. The answer could benefit from a more explicit reference to the authority of Scripture, the role of prophets, and the sovereignty of God in fulfilling prophecies."
