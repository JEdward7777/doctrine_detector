The inclusion of acknowledging diverse perspectives in society shows a respectful approach. However, the response could have further emphasized the direct causation by God in fulfilling prophecies to more closely align with the specified concern. Additionally, tying in specific examples of fulfilled prophecies from Scripture could have strengthened the response further. Overall, a well-rounded and respectful explanation from a Christian worldview perspective."
