  "grade": 72.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 72\n\nComments: The answer provides a thoughtful exploration of the figurative uses of the word \"soul\" in the Bible and its importance for understanding human identity. The student demonstrates an appreciation for the spiritual and relational aspects of the soul as depicted in biblical narratives. However, there is a lack of explicit reference to key Christian doctrinal beliefs about the soul, such as its immortality, creation by God, and its role in salvation. Additionally, while sensitivity and inclusivity are important, the focus should be on presenting biblical truths with doctrinal accuracy. Encouraging the student to deepen their analysis by incorporating specific biblical references and theological doctrines related to the soul would enhance the grade."
