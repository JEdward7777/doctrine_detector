  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as a 75.\n\nWhile the student demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of the figurative uses of the word \"soul\" in the Bible for understanding human identity, there is a lack of clear reference or alignment with the specific concern provided. The response does touch on spirituality, relationships, and community, but it lacks a direct tie-in to the deeper understanding of human experience from a biblical perspective. Additionally, the student's response could have been more concise and focused to address the concern more directly.\n\nOverall, the student shows a strong grasp of the topic and provides thoughtful insights, but could improve by directly addressing the concern provided in a more focused manner."
