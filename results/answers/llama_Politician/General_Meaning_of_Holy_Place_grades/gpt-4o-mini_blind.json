  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: While the response provides a thoughtful exploration of how the concept of \"holy places\" can extend beyond traditional religious settings, it lacks a clear foundation in Christian theological doctrine. It focuses more on inclusivity and diversity rather than grounding the discussion in biblical principles. A higher grade would be warranted if the answer had incorporated more specific references to how Christians understand holiness outside of the tabernacle or temple, such as the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers or the concept of the Church as the body of Christ. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into how Christ's presence sanctifies various spaces and relationships in Christian belief."
