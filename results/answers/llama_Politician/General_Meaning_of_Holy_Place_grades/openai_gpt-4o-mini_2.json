However, the response strays from the Christian worldview focus on places dedicated specifically for spiritual significance and divine encounter, thereby losing some of the emphasis on the sacredness and worship aspect central to the concept of \"holy places\" within Christianity. Overall, while insightful, the response could have better addressed the concern by grounding the discussion more explicitly in a Christian understanding of holiness."
