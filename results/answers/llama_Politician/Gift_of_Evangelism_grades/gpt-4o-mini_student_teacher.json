  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written and thoughtful response to the question, demonstrating an understanding of evangelism as sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ with passion. However, the student's answer does not explicitly address the concern regarding the spiritual gifts related to evangelism and their role in the church. The student's response leans more towards the broad concept of evangelism rather than diving into the specific spiritual gifts that set evangelists apart from other Christians. To improve the grade, the student should have incorporated more directly the spiritual gifts aspect within their explanation of evangelism."
