  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response on ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily lives. The suggestions offered align well with Christian principles of faith and obedience to God's Word. The emphasis on mindfulness, gratitude, Scripture study, generosity, relationships, using talents for God's glory, and being an ambassador of God's love are all commendable. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly mention the importance of acknowledging Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior in the process of glorifying God, as He is central to Christian faith. Overall, a strong and insightful answer."
