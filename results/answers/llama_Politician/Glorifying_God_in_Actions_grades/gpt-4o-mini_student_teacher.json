  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive list of practical ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily lives, emphasizing the importance of authenticity and integrity in living out one's faith. However, the student's answer lacks a specific focus on sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments as the primary means of glorifying God, as highlighted in the reference answer. This emphasis is important in truly reflecting God's glory to others. Further integration of this aspect would have strengthened the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
