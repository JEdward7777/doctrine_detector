  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and inclusive perspective on the statement made by Jesus, emphasizing the importance of striving towards goodness and compassion in our own lives. However, the student's answer lacked a clear connection to the Christian worldview and the specific concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. The student's response could have been improved by explicitly linking Jesus' statement to the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness, as highlighted in the reference answer."
