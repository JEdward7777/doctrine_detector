  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 80. \n\nThe student did a good job in acknowledging the concept of a remnant as an expression of God's selective grace towards His people. They also highlighted the biblical narrative of a faithful remnant being preserved during times of judgment. However, the student's response lacked a clear emphasis on the significance of being chosen by God, as specified in the concern. While they did touch upon the idea of God choosing to spare a portion of the nation, the focus on God's selective grace and the significance of being chosen could have been more prominent in their explanation.\n\nOverall, the student provided a well-thought-out response that demonstrated an understanding of the concept of a remnant from a biblical perspective, but could have aligned more closely with the specified concern."
