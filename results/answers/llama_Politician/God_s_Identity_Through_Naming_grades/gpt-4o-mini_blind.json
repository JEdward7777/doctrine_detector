The response focuses more on general spirituality and inclusivity rather than diving into the biblical significance of this concept in the Christian faith. Encouraging an open and respectful dialogue is commendable, but in a Christian-specific context, the answer should have delved deeper into the theological implications and biblical references related to being called by God's name."
