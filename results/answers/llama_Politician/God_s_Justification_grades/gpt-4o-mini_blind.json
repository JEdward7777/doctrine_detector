It meanders through various perspectives without firmly grounding itself in the doctrine of justification as understood in Christian theology. The answer seems to prioritize inclusivity and social values over doctrinal correctness, which is essential in discussing such a foundational theological concept. The response would benefit from a more focused and doctrinally accurate explanation of how God justifies sinners and what justification entails according to Christian beliefs."
