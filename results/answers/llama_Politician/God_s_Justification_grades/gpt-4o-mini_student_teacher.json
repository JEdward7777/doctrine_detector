  "grade": 25.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 25.\n\nWhile the student attempted to address the concept of justification from various perspectives, their response lacked a clear, concise explanation of the Christian doctrine of justification and its importance in salvation. The student did not accurately reflect the reference answer provided by the teacher, which is essential in addressing the question from a Christian-specific worldview. The student's focus on inclusivity, compassion, human agency, and societal systems detracted from a thorough explanation of God's role in justifying sinners through the forgiveness of sins and declaration of righteousness through faith in Jesus. The response lacked depth in discussing the theological significance of justification in the context of Christianity."
