The emphasis on fostering interfaith dialogue and cooperation is commendable from a perspective of inclusivity and respect for diversity. However, the response could have further highlighted the importance of understanding God's name in the context of deepening reverence and worship, aligning closely with the concern provided. Strengthening the connection between comprehending God's name and its impact on worship would have enhanced the overall theological depth of the response."
