However, it falls short of fully embracing the significance of God's name 'Yahweh' in deepening reverence and understanding in worship, which is a crucial aspect of Christian faith. It is important to strike a balance between inclusivity and honoring the unique attributes of God, such as His eternal existence and unchanging nature signified by the name 'Yahweh'. Encouraging empathy and tolerance should not come at the expense of neglecting the profound spiritual implications of God's name."
