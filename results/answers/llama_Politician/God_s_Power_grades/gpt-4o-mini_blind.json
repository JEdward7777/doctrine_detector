  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a somewhat vague and overly poetic response to the question. While they touch on some aspects of God's nature as Almighty, the language used is more focused on emotional appeal rather than doctrinal precision. The student correctly acknowledges God's power and authority but does not delve deeply into the biblical implications of God's almightiness, such as His sovereignty, omnipotence, and transcendence. The use of flowery language detracts from the clarity and depth of the answer, making it less effective in conveying the significance of God's nature as Almighty. A more direct and scripturally-grounded explanation would have improved the grade."
