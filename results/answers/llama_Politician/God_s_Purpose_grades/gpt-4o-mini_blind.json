  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer focuses more on personal reflection and general spirituality rather than providing a clear Christian perspective on discerning God's plan. While the emphasis on humility, compassion, and respecting others' beliefs is commendable, there is a lack of scriptural reference or guidance on seeking God's will. Encouraging personal growth and community involvement is positive, but the response misses the mark on addressing the question from a Christian worldview. The grade reflects the need for a more centered approach on seeking God's plan as it aligns with Christian teachings."
