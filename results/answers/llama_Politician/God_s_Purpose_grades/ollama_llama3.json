  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response acknowledges the concern about believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling, but it does not directly address God's plan in relation to the individual's life. While it touches on the importance of values, passions, and strengths, it does not provide a clear understanding of how one can discern God's will for their life.\n\nThe response also focuses more on cultivating a sense of community and social justice rather than providing specific guidance on how individuals can discover their purpose or calling. While this is an important aspect of Christian living, it may not directly address the concern of spiritual uncertainty that many believers face.\n\nA higher grade would require the response to explicitly address the concern about discerning God's plan and provide practical guidance for believers who are seeking to understand their purpose or calling in life."
