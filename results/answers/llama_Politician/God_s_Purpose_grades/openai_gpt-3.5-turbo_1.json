However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern raised about believers feeling lost or confused in their spiritual journey. While it encourages open-mindedness and exploration, it does not offer specific guidance on how to overcome spiritual uncertainty through prayer, seeking counsel, or relying on Scripture. Strengthening the connection between discerning God's plan and addressing believers' uncertainties would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
