The response should have highlighted the significance of God's name as revealed in Scripture and its importance in the Christian faith. There was an unnecessary emphasis on sensitivity towards the name \"Yahweh\" without focusing on the reverence and awe that should accompany its usage. The cultural and linguistic context could have been discussed within the framework of understanding God's character and identity."
