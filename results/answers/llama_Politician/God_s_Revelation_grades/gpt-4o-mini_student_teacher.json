  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated response discussing various names and aspects of how God introduces Himself in the Bible. However, the student's answer lacked a clear emphasis on the significance of God's revelation in understanding His character and relationship with His followers, as indicated in the concern. The student focused more on the cultural sensitivity and inclusivity aspects rather than diving into the depth of God's identity and covenant relationship with His people. Further exploration and integration of the teacher's specific reference answer would have improved the overall grade."
