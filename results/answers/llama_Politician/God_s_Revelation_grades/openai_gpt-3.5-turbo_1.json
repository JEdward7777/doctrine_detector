However, there was some unnecessary hesitation and sensitivity shown towards using the name 'Yahweh' directly, which seemed to prioritize cultural concerns over acknowledging God's specific revelation. While cultural contexts are important to consider, it is crucial to focus on God's self-revelation and His character, as this is fundamental to understanding His relationship with His followers."
