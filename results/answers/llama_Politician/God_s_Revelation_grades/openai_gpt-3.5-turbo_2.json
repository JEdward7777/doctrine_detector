However, there is a lack of direct engagement with the concern provided, which emphasized the importance of God's revelation in understanding His character and relationship with His followers. The response could have been strengthened by directly tying in the importance of God's self-revelation through His name to deepen the understanding of His character and relationship with His followers."
