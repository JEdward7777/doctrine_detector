However, it falls short in emphasizing the crucial point of God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation. The focus on inclusivity and diverse interpretations detracts from the core Christian belief that being \"born again\" is a work of God's grace. The response could have highlighted the importance of recognizing God's role as central in the process of spiritual rebirth."
