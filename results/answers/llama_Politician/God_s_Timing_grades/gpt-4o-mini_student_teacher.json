  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and respectful reflection on the concept of \"appointed time\" and its significance in fostering faith in God's plans. They emphasized humility, trust, and surrender in recognizing God's sovereignty. However, the response could have been more focused on directly addressing the relationship between God's timing and our expectations in life, as specified in the concern. Bringing in more direct biblical references or examples could have strengthened the Christian-specific worldview perspective."
