  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComments: The response lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to address the question directly. The student's emphasis on inclusivity and sensitivity veers away from the Christian-specific worldview needed to understand God's punishment during the 'day of Yahweh.' The answer should have focused on the biblical descriptions of God's punishment during this time rather than broad interfaith considerations. The student should strive to provide a more focused and doctrinally sound response in the future."
