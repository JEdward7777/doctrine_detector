  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear understanding of the nature of God's judgment and consequences for disbelief during the 'day of Yahweh.' The focus on inclusivity and sensitivity, while important, overshadows the biblical teachings on divine judgment and wrath. The student's answer falls short in addressing the Christian worldview concerning God's punishment as described in the reference answer."
