  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response strays significantly from the given answer and concern. While it attempts to approach the topic with sensitivity and inclusivity, it fails to address the nature of God's judgment on disbelief as described in the provided answer. Instead, it focuses more on promoting interfaith dialogue and general values of compassion and tolerance. The lack of engagement with the core theological concept of God's wrath as a consequence for disbelief impacts the relevance and depth of the response."
