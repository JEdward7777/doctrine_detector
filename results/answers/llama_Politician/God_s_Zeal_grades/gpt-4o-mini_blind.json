The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to emphasize the uniqueness of God's relationship with His chosen people, Israel, as depicted in the Bible. It also strays from the core theological understanding that God's zeal is tied to His righteous judgment and holiness. The emphasis on inclusivity, while important in its own right, should not compromise the foundational truths of Christianity. More focus on biblical references and the specific actions of God towards His people would have strengthened the response."
