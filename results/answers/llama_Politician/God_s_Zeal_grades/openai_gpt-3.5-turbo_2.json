The response does not explicitly emphasize how recognizing God's zeal can deepen believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being. It would have been stronger if it had connected the diverse perspectives discussed to the concern raised in the question, showing how understanding God's zeal can indeed strengthen believers' faith and trust in His care for them."
