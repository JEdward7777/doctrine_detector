The emphasis on seeking medical attention for mental health concerns is commendable. However, the answer could have been strengthened by highlighting the foundational role of Jesus' divinity and the spiritual warfare aspect of demonic possession. Additionally, connecting Jesus' actions to His identity as the Son of God and Savior would have further enriched the doctrinal perspective."
