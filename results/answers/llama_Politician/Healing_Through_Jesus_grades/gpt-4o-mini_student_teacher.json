  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful response exploring various aspects of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals. However, the answer did not directly address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. The reference answer succinctly captures the primary method Jesus used for healing demon-possessed individuals, which is essential in understanding His authority in the spiritual realm. The student's response, though insightful, lacked focus on this specific aspect, leading to a lower grade."
