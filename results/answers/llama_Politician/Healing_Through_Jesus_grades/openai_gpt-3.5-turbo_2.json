  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful exploration of how Jesus approached healing those possessed by demons, emphasizing His compassion, authority, and the importance of understanding cultural context. The student effectively addresses the concern by highlighting Jesus' authority over evil spirits and the role of prayer and faith in healing. The response is well-rounded, integrates biblical references, and maintains a Christian worldview perspective throughout. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to elaborate further on the specific spiritual implications of Jesus' actions in casting out demons."
