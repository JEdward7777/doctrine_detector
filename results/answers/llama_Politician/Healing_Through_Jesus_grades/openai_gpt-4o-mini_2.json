  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals, emphasizing His authority over evil spirits and the importance of prayer and faith in the healing process. The student effectively integrates biblical references and demonstrates an understanding of the Christian worldview in addressing the concern. The only minor critique is the lack of direct reference to the term 'casting out demons' as mentioned in the given answer, which could have further strengthened the alignment with the original statement. Overall, a strong response reflecting a Christian perspective on the topic."
