  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-articulated and respectful discussion on the topic of anointing in the New Testament, the response lacked a direct and clear connection to the role of anointing in spiritual and physical healing. The explanation focused more on the symbolic and cultural significance of anointing rather than addressing its specific relationship to healing as part of Christian practice. The response could have been strengthened by directly referencing the practice of anointing for seeking healing and God's intervention, as indicated in the reference answer."
