  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The response provides a general overview of who was permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant and under what circumstances. It correctly mentions the high priest Aaron and his descendants as the designated individuals, as well as the consequences faced by King Uzziah for his unauthorized approach. However, the response lacks depth in terms of biblical references and theological significance. Additionally, the student could have elaborated more on the spiritual implications of approaching such a sacred object without proper authorization. Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding but could benefit from more comprehensive biblical support and analysis."
