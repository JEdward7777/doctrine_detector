  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written and insightful response, acknowledging the significance of the high priest's role in approaching the Ark of the Covenant. They correctly mention the specific authority and purification required for approaching the Ark, as well as the consequences of unauthorized access. However, the answer strays off-topic at points and includes unnecessary details about Uzziah. Focusing more on the high priest's singular responsibility and annual access for the Day of Atonement would have strengthened the response."
