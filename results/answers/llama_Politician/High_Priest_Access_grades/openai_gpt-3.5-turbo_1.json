The mention of the Day of Atonement aligns well with the concern provided, emphasizing the significance of the high priest's annual approach to the ark. The response shows respect towards the biblical account and the importance of following religious customs. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a more explicit link between the high priest's role and the concept of atonement in the context of the covenant between God and the Israelites."
