  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student demonstrated an attempt to show cultural sensitivity and respect, their answer missed the crucial Christian worldview perspective of acknowledging God's role in instructing the Israelites to eat unleavened bread as part of their deliverance from Egypt. It is important for responses to recognize the significance of divine intervention in historical events, particularly in this context. The student's answer lacked this critical element, resulting in a lower grade."
