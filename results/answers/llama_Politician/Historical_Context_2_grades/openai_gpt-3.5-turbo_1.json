However, it falls short in fully recognizing the deep historical and religious significance of the event. The language used is somewhat dismissive of the symbolic and faith-based elements tied to the Israelites' consumption of unleavened bread. A stronger emphasis on the religious implications would have been more in line with a Christian worldview that values the spiritual aspects of historical events."
