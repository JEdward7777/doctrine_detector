The student correctly stated that God instructed the Israelites to eat unleavened bread as part of their deliverance from slavery in Egypt. However, the response also showed sensitivity towards cultural understanding, which is commendable. The only improvement could be to emphasize more strongly the religious significance and symbolism behind the practice of eating unleavened bread, to align more closely with a Christian worldview."
