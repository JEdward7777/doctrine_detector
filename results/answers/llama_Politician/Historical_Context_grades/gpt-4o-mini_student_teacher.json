  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of \"remnant\" in Isaiah and Amos, relating it to faithfulness amidst societal challenges and emphasizing the themes of hope, redemption, and individual accountability. The response could have been improved by focusing more directly on the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises, as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, while the student showed awareness of diverse perspectives, a stronger connection to a Christian-specific worldview in discussing the theological implications of the concept of remnant would have been beneficial."
