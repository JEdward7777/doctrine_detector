  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does address the concern by providing relevant biblical examples from Isaiah and Amos, which illustrates the concept of a remnant in relation to God's promises. The writer explains that these passages highlight the idea that even in times of great spiritual darkness, there is always hope for redemption and renewal. This demonstrates a good understanding of the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more explicit connections between the biblical examples and the concept of a remnant in relation to God's promises. The writer's tangential mention of \"pressing matters of state\" at the end also detracts from the overall coherence and relevance of the response.\n\nComment: While this response provides some relevant biblical examples, it could benefit from more explicit connections between these examples and the concept of a remnant in relation to God's promises. Additionally, the writer's sudden mention of \"pressing matters of state\" at the end feels out of place and detracts from the overall effectiveness of the response."
