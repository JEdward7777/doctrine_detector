  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the biblical concept of a remnant in relation to God's promises as highlighted in the narratives of Isaiah and Amos. The student effectively references specific passages and themes from the texts to support their explanation. There is a clear attempt to address the concern regarding the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises. The inclusion of additional examples and a call for sensitivity towards diverse perspectives enhances the overall depth of the response. However, a more direct connection to the stated concern and a stronger conclusion tying back to the initial answer could further strengthen the response."
