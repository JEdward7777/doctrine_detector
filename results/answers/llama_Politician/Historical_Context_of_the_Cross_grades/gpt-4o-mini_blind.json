However, the emphasis on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity detracts from the centrality of the Christian doctrine regarding the cross. The response could benefit from a stronger focus on the theological significance of the crucifixion and its transformation of the cross as a symbol of redemption and salvation. While acknowledging the importance of empathy and understanding, the response should prioritize presenting the Christian worldview with doctrinal accuracy and clarity."
