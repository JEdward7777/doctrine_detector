  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and thorough response, offering various examples of individuals from the Bible who built altars and discussing the significance of those acts. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the specific examples provided in the reference answer and by emphasizing the importance of faithfulness and commitment to God as demonstrated through building altars. Additionally, the response could have incorporated more direct references to the scriptural passages themselves to strengthen the biblical perspective. Overall, while the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic, there was room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with the Christian worldview."
