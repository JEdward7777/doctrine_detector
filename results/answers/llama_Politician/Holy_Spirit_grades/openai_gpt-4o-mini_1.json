While these suggestions promote understanding and dialogue, they could potentially dilute the core Christian belief in the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity. Ensuring a balance between sensitivity to others' beliefs and maintaining the clarity of Christian teachings is important in order to prevent misconceptions. More emphasis on the foundational Biblical teachings about the Holy Spirit and His role in the believer's life would strengthen the response in addressing the concern of preventing misunderstandings."
