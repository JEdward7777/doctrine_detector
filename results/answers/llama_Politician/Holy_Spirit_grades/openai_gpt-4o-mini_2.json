However, there is a lack of emphasis on clearly articulating the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity and explaining the essential role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life through sound teaching. While the response promotes respectful dialogue and openness, it could strengthen the clarity of teaching about the Holy Spirit's identity and work to prevent misconceptions."
