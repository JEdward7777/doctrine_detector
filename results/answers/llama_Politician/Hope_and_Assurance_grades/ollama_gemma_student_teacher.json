  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the significance of having no hope according to biblical references. The response acknowledges the complexity of the concept and provides insightful examples from various narratives. However, it would benefit from a more explicit connection to the teacher's reference answer, which explicitly highlights the contradiction between having no hope and the promises of God."
