  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as a 60.\n\nWhile the student correctly identifies the term \"hosts\" in scripture as related to God's angels or heavenly messengers, they fail to fully encompass the broader scope of the term. The reference answer correctly notes that it can also refer to armies of angels, the spirit world, and celestial bodies like stars and planets, based on the context. The student's answer also lacks depth and specific biblical references beyond Psalm 103:20-21.\n\nThe comment would be that the student showed some understanding of the term \"hosts\" but needs to delve deeper into the breadth of its meaning within scripture and provide more comprehensive and accurate biblical references. Further study and examination of scripture would enhance their understanding and ability to articulate the concept more effectively."
