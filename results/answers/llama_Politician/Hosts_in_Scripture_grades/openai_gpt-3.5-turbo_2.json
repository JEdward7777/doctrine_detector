However, the focus on God's omnipresence and power could have been more directly tied to the impact on prayer and spiritual battles, as per the concern provided. It is important for a Christian worldview to emphasize the significance of spiritual warfare and divine authority in shaping one's prayer life and approach to spiritual battles. The response could have delved deeper into how understanding the roles of angels and the spiritual realm influences a believer's perspective on prayer and engaging in spiritual warfare."
