  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the term \"hosts\" in scripture based on the given answer. However, the concern raised about the impact of understanding spiritual warfare and divine authority on prayer and spiritual battles is not directly addressed in the response. While the explanation of the concept is accurate, the lack of application to the believer's perspective and spiritual battles slightly lowers the grade in incorporating a Christian worldview."
