  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and comprehensive response to addressing jealousy in relationships. They emphasized the importance of empathy, communication, addressing underlying issues, fostering trust, and seeking professional help when needed. Their approach aligns well with Christian values of understanding, communication, forgiveness, and seeking guidance. However, the student could have explicitly mentioned the need to rely on God's grace and guidance in navigating and overcoming feelings of jealousy within relationships. Incorporating a Christian perspective would have enhanced the depth of their answer."
