  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-articulated explanation of how a person can be declared righteous according to Christian teachings. However, the student's emphasis on inclusivity and diversity in religious beliefs, though important in certain contexts, somewhat dilutes the clarity and specificity of the Christian perspective on righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. A more focused and explicitly Christian-centered explanation would enhance the overall response."
