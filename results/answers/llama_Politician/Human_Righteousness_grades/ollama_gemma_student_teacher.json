It also acknowledges the diversity of religious beliefs and promotes respect for different perspectives. \n\nWhile the answer is largely accurate, it could benefit from a more concise explanation of the process of justification or salvation in Christian theology. Additionally, the conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly stating that righteousness is a gift from God that is received through faith in Jesus Christ."
