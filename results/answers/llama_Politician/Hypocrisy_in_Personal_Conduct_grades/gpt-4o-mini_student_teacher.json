However, the answer does not explicitly mention seeking God's guidance through prayer or living authentically according to His Word, which are foundational aspects of ensuring alignment with beliefs from a Christian worldview. Encouraging the integration of these spiritual practices would enhance the student's response and better address the concern of avoiding hypocrisy within a Christian perspective."
