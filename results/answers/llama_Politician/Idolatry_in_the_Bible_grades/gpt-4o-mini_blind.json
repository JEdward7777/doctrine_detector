However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness and clarity in presenting the consequences of idolatry as illustrated in the Bible. The student should focus more on accurately conveying the biblical teachings on idolatry without diluting or avoiding critical aspects for the sake of inclusivity. It is crucial to prioritize delivering the scriptural message accurately over potential offense or misunderstandings."
