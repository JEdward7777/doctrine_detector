  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the historical context and religious perspectives surrounding Jesus' crucifixion. They effectively analyze the motivations of the Sadducees and Pharisees, considering their distinct interpretations of Jewish law and traditions. The student also acknowledges the complex interplay of political, religious, and social factors that led to Jesus' death. However, the grade could be improved by providing more explicit analysis of the selfishness and hypocrisy of the religious leaders, as suggested in the reference answer."
