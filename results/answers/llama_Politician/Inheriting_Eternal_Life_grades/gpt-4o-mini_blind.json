  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided is quite ambiguous and lacks doctrinal clarity. While the student touches on the importance of Jesus Christ as the central figure in the story of salvation, there is a significant amount of relativism and inclusivity presented that departs from a Christian worldview. The emphasis should have been on the exclusive nature of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, rather than downplaying the distinctiveness of Christian doctrine in relation to other religious traditions. The response would benefit from a clearer proclamation of the Gospel message according to biblical teachings."
