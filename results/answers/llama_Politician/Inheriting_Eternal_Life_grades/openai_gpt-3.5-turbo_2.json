However, it lacks clarity in presenting a definitive path to salvation as taught by Jesus. The inclusion of other religious traditions and spiritual paths without emphasizing the exclusive nature of Christ's teachings on eternal life may lead to confusion and dilution of Christian beliefs. More emphasis on the unique and exclusive role of Jesus Christ as the way to eternal life would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
