However, it lacks a clear emphasis on the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus Christ alone, as highlighted in John 14:6. While it acknowledges the diversity of spiritual paths, it falls short in clearly articulating the unique and central role of Jesus in salvation. Clarifying this aspect would strengthen the alignment with a Christian specific worldview."
