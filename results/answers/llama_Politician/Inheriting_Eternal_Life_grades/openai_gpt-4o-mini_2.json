The response presents a somewhat inclusive perspective by suggesting that different religious traditions and paths may lead to eternal life, which may lead to confusion or compromise of biblical teachings on salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone. Clarifying and emphasizing Jesus as the essential and exclusive way to eternal life would align more closely with a Christian worldview."
