  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response addressing various examples of injustice in the world today. They also outlined practical steps for Christians to respond to these injustices in a compassionate and respectful manner. However, the student's response lacks a clear emphasis on the biblical principles of justice, mercy, and righteousness as outlined in the reference answer. Encouraging a stronger alignment with these principles would strengthen the Christian-specific worldview perspective in their response."
