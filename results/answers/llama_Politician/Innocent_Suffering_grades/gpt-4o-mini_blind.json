  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provides a good overview of the concept of \"innocent blood\" in the Bible and its implications for the value of life. The student shows an attempt to be sensitive to diverse perspectives, which is commendable. However, the response lacks depth in exploring the theological significance of innocent blood and its connection to Christ's sacrifice and redemption. More scriptural references and theological insights could enhance the answer's doctrinal correctness."
