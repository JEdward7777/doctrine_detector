  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response to the question, addressing various aspects of how our responses to God can impact His will for our lives. The student effectively emphasizes the importance of aligning ourselves with God's will, trusting and surrendering to His sovereignty, and discerning His guidance. The inclusion of relevant analogies and practical examples adds depth to the answer. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in terms of simplicity and conciseness, which could have been improved. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response deserving of a high grade."
