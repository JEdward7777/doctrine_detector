However, the concern about understanding judgment as crucial for one's relationship with God and the urgency of faith was not directly addressed. While fostering understanding and respect among people with diverse beliefs is important, it is crucial in a Christian worldview to acknowledge and emphasize the significance of judgment in shaping one's relationship with God and the urgency of faith in light of \"the last day.\" Further integration of these Christian-specific perspectives would have strengthened the response."
