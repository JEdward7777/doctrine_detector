  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a commendable effort to approach the topic with sensitivity and inclusivity. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer falls short in providing a clear explanation of \"divine glory\" specifically within the context of worship. The response lacks a distinct biblical perspective on the concept and does not clearly articulate the Christian understanding of \"divine glory\" as the manifestation of God's presence, power, and perfection. Additionally, the answer seems to prioritize general spirituality and humanistic values over biblical truths. The student should strive to incorporate more Scriptural references and theological depth in future responses."
