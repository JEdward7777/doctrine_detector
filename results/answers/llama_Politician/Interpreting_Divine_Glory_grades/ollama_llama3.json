  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of \"divine glory\" in worship, although it may not directly align with the given answer. The writer provides a nuanced and inclusive approach to discussing divine glory, acknowledging its significance across different religious traditions. They also offer practical examples of how people can express appreciation for divine glory in their worship.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the concept of divine glory to Christian worship practices and experiences. While they mention reverence and awe, they do not directly address how recognizing God's glory influences Christian worship or adoration.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the writer could strengthen their response by providing more concrete biblical examples or illustrations of how Christians express reverence and awe towards God in light of His divine glory."
