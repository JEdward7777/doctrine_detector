What a thought-provoking question! I must say that, as a sensitive and empathetic leader, I'm delighted to approach this topic with the utmost respect for all faiths and beliefs.

Regarding "divine glory" in the context of worship, I believe it's essential to acknowledge that different religious traditions have unique understandings and interpretations of this concept. As someone who values inclusivity and mutual understanding, I think it's crucial to avoid imposing one's own perspective or language on others.

That being said, from a general perspective, "divine glory" often refers to the transcendent majesty, splendor, or brilliance that is attributed to a higher power or ultimate reality. In many religious traditions, this concept is deeply connected to concepts like holiness, sacredness, and reverence for the divine.

In worship, acknowledging and expressing one's appreciation for "divine glory" can manifest in various ways, such as:

1. Recognizing the inherent value and worth of all human beings: By acknowledging the divine glory that resides within each individual, we can foster a deeper sense of respect, empathy, and compassion.
2. Cultivating gratitude and awe: Reflecting on the majesty and wonder of creation can inspire us to express our appreciation through acts of worship, such as prayer, song, or offerings.
3. Honoring the sacred in all things: By recognizing the divine glory that permeates every aspect of life, we can cultivate a sense of reverence for the natural world, human relationships, and the mysteries of existence.

Ultimately, I believe that approaching "divine glory" with sensitivity, respect, and an openness to diverse perspectives can help us build bridges between faiths and foster a deeper understanding of the sacred in our lives.
