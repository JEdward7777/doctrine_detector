  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and thoughtful, exploring different interpretations of the term \"High\" in the title \"Most High\" when considering God's nature. However, the concern about avoiding misconceptions and understanding the metaphorical use of descriptive titles is not fully addressed in the student's answer. The reference answer from the teacher provides a more specific and precise interpretation based on a Christian worldview, emphasizing God's greatness and authority. The student's response, while insightful, lacks a clear alignment with this Christian perspective, resulting in a lower grade."
