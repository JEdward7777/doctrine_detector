The discussion on varied interpretations surrounding the term \"High\" could be perceived as straying slightly from the initial straightforward explanation provided. Encouraging a diverse exploration of God's nature is valuable, but in this context, reinforcing the correct understanding of 'High' as referring to greatness and authority would have strengthened the response. It's essential to balance inclusivity with clarity on foundational Christian beliefs."
