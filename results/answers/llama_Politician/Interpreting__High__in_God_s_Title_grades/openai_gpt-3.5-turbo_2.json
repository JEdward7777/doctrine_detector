However, while the response highlights the complexity of interpreting descriptive titles for God, it could have more directly addressed the concern about avoiding misconceptions by emphasizing the foundational understanding that \"'High' refers to greatness and authority, not to physical height, emphasizing God's supremacy over everything.\" Additionally, a clearer connection could have been made between the proposed approach of inclusivity and respect and the understanding of God's supremacy."
