It does a good job of exploring the significance of this moment in highlighting Jesus' humanity and the depth of his experience on the cross. However, while the response does touch on Jesus' suffering and mission, it could have delved even deeper into the theological implications of his refusal of the wine mixed with myrrh and how it relates to his sacrificial role."
