  "grade_comment": "Grade: 35/100\n\nComments: The answer provided lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to accurately reflect the Christian worldview. It downplays the unique and foundational Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the only source of resurrection and eternal life. The response also emphasizes inclusivity at the expense of acknowledging the exclusive claims of Jesus Christ as stated in the Bible. It is important to prioritize presenting Jesus' words in their intended theological context rather than diluting them to fit a politically correct narrative."
