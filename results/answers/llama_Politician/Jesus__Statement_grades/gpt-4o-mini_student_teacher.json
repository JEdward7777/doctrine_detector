  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the key Christian understanding of Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. The response lacks depth and accuracy in interpreting the statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life.\" It veers off into a politically correct and overly inclusive interpretation that dilutes the Christian significance of Jesus' words. To better align with the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection for faith and theological understanding, a more direct and scripturally grounded explanation is needed."
