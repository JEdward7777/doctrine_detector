  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe respondent does a good job of acknowledging the significance of Jesus' statement and attempting to provide some context for its meaning. They also try to emphasize the inclusive and universal themes that can be applied to people from different faiths and cultures. However, their interpretation of Jesus' words is not as deeply theological or Biblically grounded as it could be.\n\nThe main issue with this response is that it does not adequately address the concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. While they mention that Jesus might be emphasizing new life and renewal, they do not provide a clear explanation of how Jesus' statement relates to his divine nature and purpose. Additionally, their emphasis on building bridges between people from different backgrounds is admirable but does not necessarily address the concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection.\n\nOverall, while this response has some good elements, it could be improved by providing more theological depth and clarity on Jesus' statement."
