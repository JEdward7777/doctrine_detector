  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges Jesus' statement, it falls short in addressing the theological significance and importance of clarifying Jesus' identity as the source of resurrection. The interpretation provided lacks depth in understanding the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God and Savior. A more focused discussion on Jesus' divine nature and role in the resurrection would have better aligned with the concern raised."
