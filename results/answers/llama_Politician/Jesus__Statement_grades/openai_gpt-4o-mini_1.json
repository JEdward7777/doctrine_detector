It is important to prioritize clarity on Jesus' identity and role in salvation, especially when discussing faith matters from a Christian worldview. The response should focus more on the specific Christian teachings regarding Jesus as the source of resurrection and the significance of his statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life.\""
