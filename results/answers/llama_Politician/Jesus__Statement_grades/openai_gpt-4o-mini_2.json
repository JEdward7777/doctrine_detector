It dilutes the significance of Jesus' declaration by attempting to make it more inclusive and universal, which risks diminishing the unique Christian perspective on salvation through belief in Jesus as the source of resurrection and life. The interpretation veers more towards a secular or universalist viewpoint rather than emphasizing the Christian understanding of Jesus as the exclusive means of salvation."
