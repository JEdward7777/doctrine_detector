  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's answer shows an attempt to be inclusive and respectful of different beliefs, they failed to address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. Instead, the student focused on broader themes of love, compassion, and unity, which, while important, did not directly answer the question about Jesus using \"amen\" to emphasize His teachings. The student's response lacked depth and did not provide a clear connection between Jesus' use of \"amen\" and the authority of His teachings as described in the reference answer. The grade reflects the lack of alignment with the specified concern and the superficial treatment of the topic."
