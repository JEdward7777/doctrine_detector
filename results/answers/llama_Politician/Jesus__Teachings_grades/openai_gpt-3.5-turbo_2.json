The explanation focuses more on creating a sense of community and unity rather than acknowledging Jesus' divinity and the significance of His teachings as foundational truths. Encouraging respect for all faiths is important, but it should not dilute the distinctiveness of Jesus as the Son of God and the ultimate authority in Christian belief."
