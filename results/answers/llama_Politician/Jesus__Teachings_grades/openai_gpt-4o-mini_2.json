However, it falls short in fully recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. While the answer acknowledges the use of \"amen\" to emphasize truth, it lacks a strong emphasis on the divine authority behind Jesus' words as presented in Scripture. To align more closely with a Christian worldview, a stronger emphasis on the divine authority of Jesus' teachings as recorded in the Bible would be beneficial."
