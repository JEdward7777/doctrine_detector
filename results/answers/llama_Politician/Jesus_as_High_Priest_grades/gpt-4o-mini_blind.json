  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of Jesus' role as both priest and victim, underscoring the significance of His sacrifice on the cross. It correctly emphasizes the unique nature of Christ's priestly role and how human priests serve as mediators. The discussion could be strengthened by incorporating more specific scriptural references to support the points made and by delving deeper into the theological implications of Jesus' priesthood in relation to human priests. Additionally, while sensitivity and respect are important, the response could have been more direct and confident in presenting Christian doctrine."
