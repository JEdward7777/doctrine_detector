They appropriately address the impact of Jesus' unique priestly role on human priests and acknowledge the supremacy of Christ's sacrifice over human sacrifices. The response could be further enhanced by directly stating that Jesus is our 'great high priest' who intercedes for us and that His sacrifice renders human sacrifices unnecessary. Overall, the student's answer shows a deep understanding of the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood from a Christian worldview."
