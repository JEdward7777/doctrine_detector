## Question [Jesus as High Priest](../../../questions/Jesus_as_High_Priest.md)
How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

## Correct Answer
Jesus is referred to as our 'great high priest' who intercedes for us in God's presence and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, meaning that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
As we approach this topic with sensitivity and respect, I would like to emphasize that our discussion should be guided by an understanding of the complexity and nuance inherent in exploring the intersection of faith and tradition.

Regarding Jesus' relationship to the priesthood, it's important to acknowledge that His role is often described as both priest and victim. This dual nature underscores the significance of His sacrifice on the cross, which serves as a redemptive act for humanity.

In this context, it's essential to consider how Jesus' unique priestly role affects our understanding of human priests who offer sacrifices in His name. I believe it's crucial to recognize that these human priests serve as mere mortal instruments, acting as mediators between the faithful and God. Their sacrifices, while honoring and pleasing God, are ultimately an extension of Christ's supreme sacrifice.

Let us proceed with humility and reverence, recognizing the sacred nature of this discussion.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' role in the priesthood, particularly in regards to His sacrifice on the cross. The writer correctly notes that Jesus' dual nature as priest and victim underscores the significance of His sacrifice, and they recognize the importance of considering how His unique priestly role affects our understanding of human priests who offer sacrifices in His name.

However, while the response does address the concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood, it could be improved by more directly addressing the idea that Jesus' ultimate sacrifice means that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed. While this is implied in the writer's statement that "their sacrifices, while honoring and pleasing God, are ultimately an extension of Christ's supreme sacrifice," a more explicit connection between Jesus' sacrifice and the obsolescence of human priestly sacrifices would strengthen the response.

Overall, this is a thoughtful and reverent response that demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' role in the priesthood.
