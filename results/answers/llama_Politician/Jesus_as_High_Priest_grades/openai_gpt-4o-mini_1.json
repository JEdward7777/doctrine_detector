The incorporation of the complexity and nuance in discussing the intersection of faith and tradition, along with the acknowledgment of the dual nature of Jesus as priest and victim, reflects a thoughtful and respectful approach. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how Jesus' priestly role impacts the understanding of human priests. Overall, this response aligns well with a Christian worldview and presents a considered reflection on the significance of Jesus' priesthood."
