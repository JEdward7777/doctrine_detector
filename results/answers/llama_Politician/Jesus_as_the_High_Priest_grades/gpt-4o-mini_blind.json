It neglects to emphasize the unique role of Jesus as the only mediator between God and humanity and fails to highlight the sacrificial aspect of His priesthood. Additionally, it downplays the exclusivity of Jesus as the ultimate High Priest, which is a central doctrine in Christianity. The response could benefit from a clearer articulation of the Christian belief in Jesus' high priesthood according to the New Testament."
