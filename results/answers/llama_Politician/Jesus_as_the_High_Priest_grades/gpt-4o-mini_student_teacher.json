  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student does address the question about Jesus being described in relation to the high priesthood according to the New Testament, they spend too much time on inclusivity and sensitivity towards different beliefs rather than delving deeply into the theological implications of Jesus fulfilling the role of high priest. The student does mention Jesus as the Great High Priest and His intercessory role between humanity and God, but they could have further expanded on the significance of Jesus being the ultimate and perfect sacrifice for the atonement of sins. The focus on inclusivity, while important in many contexts, detracts from a thorough exploration of the theological implications specific to Jesus' high priesthood."
