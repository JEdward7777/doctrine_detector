  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: The student's response makes an effort to address the concern by attempting to frame the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" in a more inclusive and culturally sensitive manner. However, the student fails to clearly differentiate Jesus' divine lordship from earthly titles, which was the key focus of the concern. The student's suggestions may lead to diluting the distinctiveness and significance of the Christian message. The response lacks a direct explanation of the significance of 'Jesus is Lord' in a Christian context. Further clarity and emphasis on the central Christian belief of Jesus' supreme authority would improve the response."
