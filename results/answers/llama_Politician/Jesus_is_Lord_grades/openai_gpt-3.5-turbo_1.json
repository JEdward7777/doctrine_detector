The suggested approach of using inclusive language, focusing on the importance of faith, and highlighting the universal message of Christianity is a positive attempt to maintain clarity while being sensitive to cultural nuances. However, the response could further strengthen its Christian-specific worldview by explicitly stating the unique and supreme nature of Jesus' lordship in comparison to any human authority, emphasizing the foundational belief in Jesus as the Son of God."
