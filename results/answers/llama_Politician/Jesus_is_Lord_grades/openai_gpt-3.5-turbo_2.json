It encourages using inclusive language, emphasizing the importance of faith, and focusing on the universal message of Christianity. While these suggestions are helpful in promoting sensitivity towards diverse beliefs and cultures, the response could have more directly articulated the distinctiveness of Jesus' divine authority and supremacy over human rulers. There could have been a more explicit emphasis on the uniqueness of Jesus as Lord in a Christian worldview."
