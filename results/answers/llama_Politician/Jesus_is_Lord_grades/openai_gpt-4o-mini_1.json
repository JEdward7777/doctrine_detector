However, the suggested approach falls short of clearly differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. While the inclusive language and focus on the universal message are positive aspects, the response could have been strengthened by directly stating the unique and exclusive nature of Jesus as Lord in a more explicit manner."
