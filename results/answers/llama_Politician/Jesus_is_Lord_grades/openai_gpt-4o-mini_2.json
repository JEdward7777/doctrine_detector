However, it falls short in clearly articulating the distinctiveness of Jesus' divine lordship compared to earthly titles. The suggested approach dilutes the unique and foundational Christian belief that \"Jesus is Lord\" signifies His divine authority and supremacy over all creation. The response could have been stronger by directly emphasizing the distinctiveness of Jesus' lordship in a more explicit and unwavering manner."
