  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student showed sensitivity and respect towards the Muslim context, which is commendable. However, the provided translations significantly veered away from the original terminology of \"Jesus is the Son of God,\" instead opting for softer, more diluted phrases that may not fully communicate the core Christian belief. While it is important to be mindful of potential offense, the translations offered by the student did not adequately maintain the original terminology as advised in the reference answer. The student should aim to strike a balance between respect and accuracy in future translations."
