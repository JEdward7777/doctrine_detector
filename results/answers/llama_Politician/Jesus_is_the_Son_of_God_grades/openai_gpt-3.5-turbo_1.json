However, the translation provided does not maintain the original terminology as requested in the answer. It offers alternative phrases that convey respect for Islamic beliefs but may not accurately convey the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God. The response focuses more on accommodating Islamic sensitivities rather than prioritizing biblical accuracy and clear explanation of the Christian teaching. Balancing respect for others' beliefs with upholding the truth of one's own faith is important in interfaith dialogue."
