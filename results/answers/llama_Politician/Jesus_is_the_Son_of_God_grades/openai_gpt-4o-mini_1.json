However, the concern is not fully addressed as the suggested translations do not accurately convey the biblical understanding of Jesus' divine sonship. It is crucial to prioritize biblical accuracy while also being sensitive to other faith traditions. More emphasis on explaining the biblical significance of Jesus as the Son of God would have been beneficial."
