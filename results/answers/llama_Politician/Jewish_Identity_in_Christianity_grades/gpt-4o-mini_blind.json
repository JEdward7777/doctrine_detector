However, it falls short doctrinally by not clearly emphasizing Jesus' divinity as the Son of God and the central figure of Christianity. The focus on inclusivity and diversity, while important in certain contexts, should not overshadow the foundational Christian belief in Jesus as the Messiah and Savior. The response could have been strengthened by highlighting the theological implications of Jesus' Jewish identity in relation to Christian salvation and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies."
