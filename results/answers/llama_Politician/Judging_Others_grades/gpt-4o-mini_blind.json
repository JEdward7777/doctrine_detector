However, it falls short in highlighting the biblical exhortation for believers to exercise judgment within the Church community for the purpose of accountability and restoration, as outlined in passages like Matthew 18:15-17 and Galatians 6:1. It also misses the distinction between discernment and condemnation, wherein believers are called to discern right from wrong and correct each other in love rather than condemn. A stronger emphasis on the balance between grace and truth in the context of Christian judgment would have enhanced the theological depth and accuracy of the response."
