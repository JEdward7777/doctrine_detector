  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response, referencing relevant Bible passages and emphasizing the importance of approaching judgment with humility, compassion, and a focus on personal growth. They effectively addressed the concern about learning how to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner. However, the student included some personal interpretations and explanations that deviated slightly from the direct biblical instruction provided in the reference answer. Overall, a commendable and insightful answer."
