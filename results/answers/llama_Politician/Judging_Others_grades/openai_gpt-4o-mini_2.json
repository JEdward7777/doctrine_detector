  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a well-rounded understanding of how Christians should approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner. It effectively references biblical passages and principles that emphasize humility, compassion, empathy, and restoration over harsh judgment or condemnation. The response's incorporation of additional relevant verses, such as Matthew 7:1-5 and 1 Corinthians 4:3-5, further strengthens the argument and demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian teachings on this topic. However, it could have further expounded on practical ways to apply these principles in real-life community interactions."
