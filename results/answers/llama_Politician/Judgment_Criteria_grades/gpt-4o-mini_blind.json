  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The response lacks doctrinal correctness as it fails to clearly present the biblical perspective on how individuals will be judged on the Day of Judgment. It waters down the scriptural teaching by attempting to be inclusive of all beliefs and perspectives, which can lead to confusion and misrepresentation of Christian doctrine. The focus on promoting unity, tolerance, and empathy, while important in certain contexts, should not compromise the integrity of biblical teachings on judgment and righteousness. The response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the biblical principles of justice, repentance, and faith in Christ for salvation."
