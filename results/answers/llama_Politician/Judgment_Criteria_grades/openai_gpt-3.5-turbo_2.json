However, the emphasis on respecting diverse beliefs and promoting inclusivity may dilute the strong Christian message that individuals will be judged based on their alignment with the righteous character of Christ. It is important to maintain a clear and unwavering focus on the Christian perspective when discussing matters of judgment."
