The emphasis on respect for all beliefs, inclusivity, and unity, although positive values, detracts from the opportunity to delve deeper into the Christian perspective on judgment and alignment with Christ's righteousness. There is room for improvement in clearly articulating and emphasizing the Christian understanding of judgment and personal accountability in light of biblical teachings."
