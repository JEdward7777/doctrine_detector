However, there is a lack of direct correlation to the specific concerns outlined in the provided answer about judgment of sinners, resurrection, and the establishment of the Lord's rule. The response could have further focused on clarifying these key events in Christian eschatology to provide a more precise and in-depth explanation from a Christian worldview."
