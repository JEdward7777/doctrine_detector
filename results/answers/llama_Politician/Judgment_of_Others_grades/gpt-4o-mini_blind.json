However, it lacks specific references to Jesus' teachings on this matter, such as the log in our own eye before addressing the speck in another's eye (Matthew 7:3-5). The answer could benefit from a deeper exploration of biblical passages that directly address the question at hand. Additionally, it could be more explicit in emphasizing the importance of addressing sin in others with love, humility, and the intention of restoration, rather than solely focusing on personal improvement."
