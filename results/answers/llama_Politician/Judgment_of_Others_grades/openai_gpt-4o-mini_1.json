  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively integrates the Christian teaching of addressing one's own faults before criticizing others (Luke 6:41-42) and emphasizes the importance of humility and self-reflection. The candidate appropriately addresses the concern by advocating for self-reflection and personal growth rather than judgment and condemnation. The inclusion of biblical references and the encouragement to hold others accountable with empathy and understanding align with Christian values. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response that reflects a Christian worldview."
