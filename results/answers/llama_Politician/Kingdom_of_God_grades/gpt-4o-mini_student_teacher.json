  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the student demonstrates a thoughtful and inclusive perspective in considering the cultural context of translations, the concern raised by the teacher emphasizes the importance of retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' due to its spiritual and eschatological significance. The student's response does not address this concern directly and instead leans towards the idea of rephrasing for cultural sensitivity. \n\nOverall, the student's answer lacks alignment with the Christian-specific worldview and the emphasis on preserving the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God'. The response could be improved by incorporating more discussion on how to maintain the spiritual and theological richness of the term while still being culturally sensitive."
