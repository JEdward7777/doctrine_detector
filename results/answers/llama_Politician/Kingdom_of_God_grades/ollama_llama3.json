  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the concern about rephrasing potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term \"Kingdom of God\". While it doesn't explicitly support retaining the original phrase, it presents a thoughtful consideration for cultural nuances in translation. However, it could have more directly addressed the concern by providing concrete examples or biblical references that highlight the significance of the Kingdom of God.\n\nThe response earns points for its emphasis on inclusivity, respect, and meaningful dialogue with scholars and theologians. It also acknowledges the importance of avoiding imposition and biases, which is crucial in interfaith communication. Nevertheless, a more explicit defense of retaining the original phrase would have strengthened the response's alignment with the given answer."
