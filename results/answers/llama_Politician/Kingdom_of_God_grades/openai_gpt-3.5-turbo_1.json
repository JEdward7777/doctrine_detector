It acknowledges the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term and the importance of providing explanations to retain its meaning. However, there is an emphasis on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity which, while important, could potentially dilute the specific Christian message being conveyed. Strengthening the discussion on the theological implications of retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' and emphasizing the importance of preserving its biblical context would improve the response."
