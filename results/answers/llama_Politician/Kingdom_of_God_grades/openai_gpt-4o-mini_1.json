  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the concern about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term \"Kingdom of God\" through rephrasing. However, it does not fully align with the given answer, which suggests retaining the term and explaining its spiritual and eschatological significance. While the response emphasizes cultural sensitivity and dialogue, it does not explicitly advocate for keeping the term as advised in the given answer. There is room for improvement in ensuring consistency with the stated stance on retaining the original phrase."
