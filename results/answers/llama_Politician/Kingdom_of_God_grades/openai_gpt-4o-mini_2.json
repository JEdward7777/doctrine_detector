It emphasizes the importance of maintaining the spiritual and eschatological significance of the phrase, which aligns with a Christian worldview. However, the response also emphasizes the importance of cultural sensitivity and inclusivity, which could potentially detract from the central theological concept. A stronger alignment with the spiritual significance of the term and a clearer prioritization of upholding biblical truths over cultural considerations would have enhanced the response."
