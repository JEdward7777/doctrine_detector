  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response shows a good understanding of the unique terminology used in the gospels, particularly in Matthew's gospel, and acknowledges the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\". The writer provides a thoughtful consideration of multiple perspectives and historical context, which is reflective of the concern about understanding the intended messages of the biblical authors.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the response could be improved. For example, while the writer does acknowledge the theological implications of retaining the term \"heaven\", they do not explicitly connect these implications to the broader themes and messages of Matthew's gospel. Additionally, the response could benefit from more explicit engagement with the biblical text itself, rather than relying on personal opinions and perspectives.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the unique terminology used in the gospels, but could be even stronger with more explicit engagement with the biblical text and a clearer connection to the broader themes and messages of Matthew's gospel."
