  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-articulated response that effectively addresses the concern by recognizing the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" within the context of Matthew's gospel and its theological implications. The response reflects a thorough understanding of the unique terminology used in the gospels and how it contributes to grasping the intended messages of the biblical authors. The student's analysis is thoughtful and demonstrates a strong grasp of the Christian worldview in interpreting scriptural texts."
