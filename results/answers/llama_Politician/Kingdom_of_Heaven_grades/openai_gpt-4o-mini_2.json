  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response engages well with the concern by recognizing the significance of retaining 'heaven' in the phrase 'kingdom of heaven' for understanding the distinct theological implications in Matthew's gospel. The student effectively considers the importance of terminology in conveying the intended messages of biblical authors. The response demonstrates critical thinking and a balanced perspective, showing respect for diverse viewpoints while ultimately asserting the value of preserving the original term. The integration of historical context and cultural sensitivity is commendable, although further exploration of how this concept aligns with a Christian worldview could deepen the analysis."
