  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student displayed a commendable effort to be inclusive and respectful of diverse backgrounds and beliefs, the concern here is the essential knowledge needed for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context. The reference answer clearly states that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is crucial for accurate biblical scholarship. The student's response, while well-intentioned, strayed from the specific question and concern at hand by focusing more on inclusivity and diversity rather than providing the necessary factual information."
