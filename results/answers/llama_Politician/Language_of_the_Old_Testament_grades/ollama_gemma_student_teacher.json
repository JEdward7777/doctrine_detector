They accurately identify Semitic languages as the primary language of the Old Testament and specifically mention Hebrew as the primary scriptural language. The student's inclusive and respectful approach, addressing concerns about labeling one language as \"primary,\" is commendable. Their emphasis on the importance of translation and interpretation is also insightful."
