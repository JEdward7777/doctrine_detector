  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student provides accurate information about the language in which the Old Testament was written, acknowledging that it's not as simple as saying one language is primary over another. They also show sensitivity to linguistic diversity and cultural heritage, recognizing the importance of translation and interpretation in making the text accessible to people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because while they provide a clear answer, it's not entirely straightforward. The response could be more concise and direct, especially given the concern about understanding the original context. Additionally, while they mention Hebrew as the primary scriptural language, they don't explicitly state that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew.\n\nOverall, this is a good effort, but with some refinement, it could be even stronger!"
