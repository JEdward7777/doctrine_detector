However, it could have further emphasized the significance of Hebrew in shaping the theological and historical foundations of the Old Testament from a Christian worldview. Additionally, while the response showed sensitivity to cultural diversity, it could have incorporated more theological insights related to the Hebrew language's role in conveying God's message to humanity."
