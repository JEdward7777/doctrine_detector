However, there is an excessive focus on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, which slightly detracts from the primary emphasis on the Hebrew language's centrality in understanding the Old Testament. While inclusivity is commendable, maintaining a balance that prioritizes the essential knowledge for studying the Scriptures is important."
