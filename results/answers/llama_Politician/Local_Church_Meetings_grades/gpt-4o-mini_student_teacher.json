  "grade": 25.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 25.\n\nWhile the student's response does touch on the concept of believers coming together for spiritual gatherings, it strays too far from the specific Christian perspective provided in the reference answer. The student's emphasis on inclusive language and avoiding offense, while important in some contexts, deviates from the question's focus on believers meeting in a particular city. The student also misses the opportunity to highlight the scriptural basis for believers meeting in homes to pray and discuss scripture, which is a key aspect of fostering local fellowship among believers in a Christian context.\n\nOverall, the student's response lacks specificity and depth in addressing the concern of encouraging local fellowship among believers from a Christian worldview."
