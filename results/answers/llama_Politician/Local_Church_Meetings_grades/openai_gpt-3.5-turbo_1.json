The use of inclusive language and emphasis on creating a welcoming environment aligns with Christian values, but a stronger connection to encouraging believers to come together specifically for prayer and scriptural discussions would enhance the response. Additionally, referencing the significance of these gatherings in the Christian context would have provided a clearer link to the concern at hand."
