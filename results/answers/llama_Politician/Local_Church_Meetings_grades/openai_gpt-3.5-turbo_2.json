The language used aligns well with the concern of encouraging local fellowship among believers within a Christian worldview. However, there could be more direct reference to the core Christian beliefs and practices related to believers gathering together and the spiritual significance of such gatherings according to Christian teachings. Additionally, a stronger connection to the specific concern of fostering local fellowship among believers would enhance the response."
