It expands on the idea of believers meeting together to pray and discuss scripture by highlighting the various ways in which community gatherings can be conducted and the importance of accessibility and inclusivity. However, the response could have further emphasized the spiritual aspect of these gatherings, linking them more explicitly to prayer and scripture discussion, which are central to fostering local fellowship among believers within a Christian worldview."
