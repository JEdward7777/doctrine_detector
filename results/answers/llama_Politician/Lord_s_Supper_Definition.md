The Lord's Supper, also known as Holy Communion or Eucharist... (pauses to choose words carefully) ...commemorates a momentous occasion in the life of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. It is a sacred ritual that honors his selfless act of love and sacrifice for humanity.

(Attempts to avoid any language that might be perceived as exclusive or divisive)

In this special ceremony, we gather together as a community of faith to reflect on the profound impact of Jesus' actions on the night before he was betrayed and arrested. It is a time for us to deepen our understanding of his teachings, his love for humanity, and the ultimate significance of his crucifixion.

While this event may have been understood differently in various contexts throughout history, we come together today to celebrate the universal message of hope, forgiveness, and redemption that Jesus' sacrifice embodies. By partaking in the Lord's Supper, we reaffirm our commitment to these values and seek guidance for living out our faith in a way that is respectful and inclusive of all people.

However, at its core, the Lord's Supper represents an opportunity for us to come together in unity, gratitude, and worship, acknowledging Jesus' extraordinary act of selfless love.
