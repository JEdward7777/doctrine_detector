The language used in the response often prioritizes inclusivity and avoids clear affirmation of Christian beliefs, potentially diluting the distinctiveness of the Christian faith. It is important to maintain the foundational Christian beliefs and teachings surrounding the Lord's Supper, emphasizing its connection to Jesus' sacrifice for sin and the importance of redemption through His body and blood. The response could strengthen its Christian perspective by more clearly articulating the unique and central role of the Lord's Supper in Christian theology."
