However, the concern is that the response seemed to water down the exclusivity of Jesus as the Savior and the sacrificial nature of his death. The attempt to be inclusive and avoid potential offense may have diluted the core Christian beliefs surrounding the Lord's Supper. Overall, while the description was well-written, it could have been strengthened by presenting the Christian perspective more boldly and clearly."
