However, there is a concern with the level of ambiguity and inclusivity in the response provided, as it waters down the specific Christian theological understanding of the Lord's Supper. While the attempt to be respectful and inclusive is appreciated, it is important to maintain the core Christian beliefs and teachings without diluting them for the sake of being politically correct. Therefore, clarity and adherence to the foundational Christian doctrines could be improved in the response."
