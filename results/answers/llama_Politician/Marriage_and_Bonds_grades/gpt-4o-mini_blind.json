  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student's response provides a positive overview of marriage from a Christian perspective but falls short in doctrinal accuracy. The emphasis on inclusivity and diversity, while important in a societal context, detracts from presenting a purely Christian understanding of marriage. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into biblical teachings on marriage and the roles of husband and wife. Encouraging respect and acceptance for all individuals is commendable, but in the context of explaining the significance of marriage from a Christian viewpoint, the answer could have been more focused and scripturally grounded."
