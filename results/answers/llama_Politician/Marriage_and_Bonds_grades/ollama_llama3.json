  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response thoroughly addresses the concern to promote strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design for relationships. It accurately reflects Christian teachings on marriage as a sacred institution, emphasizing mutual love, respect, trust, and submission between spouses. The response also acknowledges the diversity of cultures and faith traditions, advocating for inclusivity and acceptance towards all individuals who choose to enter into this commitment.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response does not directly address the biblical principle that marriage should not be broken, which is highlighted in the given answer. While it mentions the importance of lifelong commitment and devotion, it could have further emphasized the gravity of marital vows and the need for couples to work towards a strong, Christ-centered marriage.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian teachings on marriage and a commitment to promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God's design."
