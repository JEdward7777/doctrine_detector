## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm happy to provide an answer that's inclusive and respectful to all individuals, regardless of their faith or background.

The names of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ can be found in three different books of the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, we find the list in chapter 10, verse 2-4, where it says: "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who was called Peter), then Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot."

Grade: 75

Comment: The response provides the correct information about where the names of the twelve disciples can be found in the Bible, referencing the Gospel of Matthew. However, the answer could have been improved by emphasizing the significance and role of the twelve disciples within the Christian faith, rather than focusing on inclusivity. A more doctrinally focused explanation would have enhanced the overall response.
