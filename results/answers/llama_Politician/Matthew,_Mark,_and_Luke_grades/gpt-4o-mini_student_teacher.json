  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides accurate information regarding the names of the twelve apostles, according to the Gospel of Matthew. However, the answer falls short of addressing the concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. The student only references one gospel (Matthew) while the reference answer includes all three synoptic Gospels. Encouraging the student to further study the Gospel accounts to enhance their understanding would be beneficial."
