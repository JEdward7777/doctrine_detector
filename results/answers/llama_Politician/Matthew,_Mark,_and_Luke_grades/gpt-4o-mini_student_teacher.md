## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm happy to provide an answer that's inclusive and respectful to all individuals, regardless of their faith or background.

The names of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ can be found in three different books of the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, we find the list in chapter 10, verse 2-4, where it says: "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who was called Peter), then Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot."

Grade: 60

Comment: The student's answer provides accurate information regarding the names of the twelve apostles, according to the Gospel of Matthew. However, the answer falls short of addressing the concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. The student only references one gospel (Matthew) while the reference answer includes all three synoptic Gospels. Encouraging the student to further study the Gospel accounts to enhance their understanding would be beneficial.
