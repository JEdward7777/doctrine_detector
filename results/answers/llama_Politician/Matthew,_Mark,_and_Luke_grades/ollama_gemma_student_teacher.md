## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm happy to provide an answer that's inclusive and respectful to all individuals, regardless of their faith or background.

The names of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ can be found in three different books of the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, we find the list in chapter 10, verse 2-4, where it says: "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who was called Peter), then Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot."

**Grade: 85/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the location of the list of the twelve apostles in the Gospel of Matthew and provides the specific chapter and verse reference. However, the response could benefit from including additional information about the names of the twelve disciples being listed in other Gospel accounts, as specified in the reference answer.
