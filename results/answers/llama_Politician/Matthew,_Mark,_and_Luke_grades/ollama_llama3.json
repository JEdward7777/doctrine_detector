  "grade_comment": "I'm happy to help! Based on the response and the concern, I would give this answer a score of 80.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe response provides some accurate information about the list of apostles being found in three different books of the Bible (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). However, it doesn't specifically mention which book contains the actual list. The concern is about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, so I would deduct points for not directly addressing this.\n\nThe response also doesn't provide any additional context or explanation about the significance of the apostles' names or their roles in the early Christian church. While it does mention Jesus Christ as the one who called the apostles, it could be more explicit in highlighting the importance of these individuals and their teachings.\n\nTo improve, I would suggest providing a clearer answer that specifically mentions which book contains the list (Matthew), and perhaps adding some additional context about the significance of the apostles or their roles in spreading the Gospel."
