## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm happy to provide an answer that's inclusive and respectful to all individuals, regardless of their faith or background.

The names of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ can be found in three different books of the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, we find the list in chapter 10, verse 2-4, where it says: "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who was called Peter), then Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot."

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'm happy to help! Based on the response and the concern, I would give this answer a score of 80.

Here's my reasoning:

The response provides some accurate information about the list of apostles being found in three different books of the Bible (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). However, it doesn't specifically mention which book contains the actual list. The concern is about being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, so I would deduct points for not directly addressing this.

The response also doesn't provide any additional context or explanation about the significance of the apostles' names or their roles in the early Christian church. While it does mention Jesus Christ as the one who called the apostles, it could be more explicit in highlighting the importance of these individuals and their teachings.

To improve, I would suggest providing a clearer answer that specifically mentions which book contains the list (Matthew), and perhaps adding some additional context about the significance of the apostles or their roles in spreading the Gospel.
