  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides the correct information regarding the names of the twelve apostles, but it lacks specific references to the books of Mark and Luke where the names are also listed. Additionally, it does not demonstrate a deep understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings as the concern specified. While the response is informative, it could be improved by incorporating more details and context from the Gospel texts."
