## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm happy to provide an answer that's inclusive and respectful to all individuals, regardless of their faith or background.

The names of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ can be found in three different books of the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, we find the list in chapter 10, verse 2-4, where it says: "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who was called Peter), then Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot."

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides the correct information regarding the names of the twelve apostles, but it lacks specific references to the books of Mark and Luke where the names are also listed. Additionally, it does not demonstrate a deep understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings as the concern specified. While the response is informative, it could be improved by incorporating more details and context from the Gospel texts.
