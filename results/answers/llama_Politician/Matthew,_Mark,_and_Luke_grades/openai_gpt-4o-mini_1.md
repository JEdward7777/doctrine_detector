## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm happy to provide an answer that's inclusive and respectful to all individuals, regardless of their faith or background.

The names of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ can be found in three different books of the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, we find the list in chapter 10, verse 2-4, where it says: "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who was called Peter), then Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot."

Grade: 70

Comment: While the response accurately provides the names of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ from the Gospel of Matthew, it falls short in addressing the concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. It lacks depth in explaining the significance or background of the apostles, which is important in understanding their roles and relationships with Jesus. Incorporating more contextual information related to the Gospel teachings would have strengthened the answer.
