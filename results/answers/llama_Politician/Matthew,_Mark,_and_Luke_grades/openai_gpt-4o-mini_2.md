## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm happy to provide an answer that's inclusive and respectful to all individuals, regardless of their faith or background.

The names of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ can be found in three different books of the Bible. In the Gospel of Matthew, we find the list in chapter 10, verse 2-4, where it says: "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon (who was called Peter), then Andrew, James the son of Zebedee, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot."

Grade: 70

Comment: The response accurately identifies where the names of the twelve apostles can be found in the Bible, but it could be improved by referencing the specific verse in the Gospel of Matthew. The concern about being familiar with Gospel teachings could have been addressed more explicitly by providing additional insight or explanation of the significance of the Twelve Apostles in Christian belief and teachings.
