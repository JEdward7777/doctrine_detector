However, the concern raised emphasizes the importance of recognizing Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of these prophecies to strengthen faith, and while the response briefly acknowledges this in passing, it could have been emphasized more prominently throughout the analysis. Furthermore, the response could have delved deeper into theological implications of these prophecies being fulfilled by Jesus from a Christian perspective."
