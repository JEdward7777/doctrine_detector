The concern specified the importance of clear teaching to differentiate Jesus from other religious savior figures while staying true to scripture, which was not fully addressed in the response. It is essential to uphold the significance of Jesus as the Messiah in Christianity and his fulfillment of biblical prophecies, which this response did not sufficiently emphasize."
