However, the answer could have been more focused and directly addressed the Christian-specific perspective on Jesus' messianic role without diluting the emphasis on universal inclusion and sensitivity towards diverse perspectives. Overall, a good effort in integrating different viewpoints, but could benefit from more clarity and emphasis on the central Christian belief regarding Jesus as the Messiah."
