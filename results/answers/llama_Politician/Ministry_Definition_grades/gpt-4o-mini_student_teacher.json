  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student's response does emphasize the importance of serving and supporting others with love and care, there are areas where the biblical specificity regarding ministry could be more clearly defined. The answer does not explicitly mention teaching about God or caring for spiritual and physical needs as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Encouraging the student to incorporate more direct biblical references and the spiritual aspect of ministering would strengthen their response. There is also a focus on general kindness and compassion, which, while important, does not fully capture the depth of ministry as understood in a Christian worldview."
