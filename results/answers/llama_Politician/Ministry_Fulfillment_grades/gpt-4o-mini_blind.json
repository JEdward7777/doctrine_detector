However, it lacks strong doctrinal grounding and biblical references to support the statements made. Additionally, there is a tendency towards a broad, generalized understanding of ministry without clearly defining the unique callings and roles within the body of Christ. Encouraging inclusivity and respect is commendable, but it should be balanced with the truth of Scripture and the uniqueness of Christian ministry as guided by biblical principles."
