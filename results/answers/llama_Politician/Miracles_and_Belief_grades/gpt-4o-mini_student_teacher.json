  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's response promotes inclusivity and respect for diverse perspectives, it lacks a clear assertion or elaboration on how miracles specifically function as signs leading to belief in God from a Christian worldview. The discussion on subjective interpretations and varying beliefs regarding miracles, while important, somewhat deviates from the main focus of the question. Encouraging diverse perspectives is commendable, but a clearer connection to the reference answer in terms of the role of miracles in affirming faith in God would have strengthened the response."
