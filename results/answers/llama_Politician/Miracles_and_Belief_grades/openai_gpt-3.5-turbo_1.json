  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response overall addresses the specified concern by acknowledging the role of miracles as indicators of God's power leading to belief. However, the answer provided in the response lacks depth and specificity in directly connecting miracles to the validation of prophets and apostles. While the response encourages respectful dialogue and diverse perspectives, it could have reinforced the Christian perspective more explicitly by emphasizing the unique and central role of miracles as manifestations of God's power in Christian belief."
