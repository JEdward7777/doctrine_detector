The reference to miracles as indicators of God's power aligns with the Christian worldview, emphasizing their role in prompting belief in Him and validating the ministry of prophets and apostles. The concern about understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith enhancing evangelism and personal faith is addressed effectively. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique significance of miracles in Christian theology and the transformative impact they have on individuals' faith journeys."
