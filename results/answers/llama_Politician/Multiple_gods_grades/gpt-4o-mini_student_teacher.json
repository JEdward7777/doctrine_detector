  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a direct and clear biblical explanation of the doctrine of the Trinity and God's singular nature, which is essential for addressing the misconception that Christians believe in multiple gods. While the answer provides some good general advice on approaching the topic with empathy and understanding, it does not sufficiently address the concern of correcting misunderstandings without compromising Christian doctrine. The response is also overly vague and lacks depth in its explanation."
