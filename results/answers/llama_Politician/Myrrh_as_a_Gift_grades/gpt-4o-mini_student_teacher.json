  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response presents some valid points about the historical and cultural significance of myrrh, but the primary concern of understanding the symbolism of the gifts given to Jesus at His birth is not adequately addressed. The student fails to directly connect myrrh to Jesus' future suffering and death, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, the response veers off into discussions about inclusivity and cultural heritage, which while important, do not directly address the question at hand. To deepen appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission, a stronger emphasis on the specific symbolism of myrrh in relation to His sacrificial role would have been more appropriate."
