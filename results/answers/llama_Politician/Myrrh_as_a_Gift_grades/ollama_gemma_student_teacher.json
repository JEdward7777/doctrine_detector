  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the symbolism of the gifts given to Jesus. The student provides a thoughtful analysis of the cultural context of the gift of myrrh and its connection to Jesus' eventual role as a sufferer and martyr. Additionally, the student offers a balanced perspective by acknowledging the broader cultural significance of the gifts while also addressing the concerns of those who emphasize the absence of women in the biblical account."
