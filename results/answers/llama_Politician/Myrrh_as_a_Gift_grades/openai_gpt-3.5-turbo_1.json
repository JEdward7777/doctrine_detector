However, there is a lack of direct engagement with this specific concern throughout the response. While the exploration of myrrh's cultural context and broader themes related to diversity and inclusivity within the Christian faith is valuable, a more direct and focused discussion on the deeper appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission through the symbolism of the gifts would have strengthened the response."
