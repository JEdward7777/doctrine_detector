However, it lacks a focused exploration of the specific concern provided, which is understanding the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus in relation to deepening appreciation of his purpose and mission. The response could have delved more directly into how the gift of myrrh specifically relates to Jesus' future suffering and death as the Messiah, in line with the concern provided."
