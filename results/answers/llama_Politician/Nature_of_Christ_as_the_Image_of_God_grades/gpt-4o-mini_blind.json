  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: This response provides a generally accurate explanation of Jesus as the image of God in Christian belief. The student appropriately references biblical passages and key theological concepts. However, the answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the unique and exclusive role of Jesus as the perfect representation of God, particularly in terms of His divinity and His sacrificial work for humanity. Additionally, the inclusive language and emphasis on respect for diverse perspectives, while commendable in some contexts, should not compromise the fundamental Christian belief in Jesus as the only way to God. Therefore, doctrinal clarity and specificity could be improved."
