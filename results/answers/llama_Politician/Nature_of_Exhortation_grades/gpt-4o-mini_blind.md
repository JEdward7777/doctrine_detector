## [Answer](../Nature_of_Exhortation.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful topic! *clears throat* As we explore the teachings of the New Testament regarding exhortation, I want to emphasize that we must prioritize sensitivity and compassion in our interactions with one another. After all, as Christians, we are called to be "ambassadors for Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:20).

In regards to exhortation specifically, the New Testament teaches us that it is a vital aspect of Christian community and growth. As Paul writes in Hebrews 3:13, "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 'Today,' so that none of you will be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."

Grade: 70

Comment: The answer provides a good start by emphasizing the importance of sensitivity and compassion in interactions, which aligns with the Christian value of love. However, it could have delved deeper into scriptural teachings on exhortation and provided more specific examples or instructions on how Christians should approach exhortation according to the New Testament. A greater incorporation of relevant Bible verses or teachings would have strengthened the answer.
