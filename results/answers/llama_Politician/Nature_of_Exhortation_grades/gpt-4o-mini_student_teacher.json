  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively highlights the importance of sensitivity and compassion in exhortation, aligning well with the concern of delivering encouragement in a loving and supportive manner. They referenced relevant Bible verses and emphasized the aspect of Christian community and growth in relation to exhortation. However, the teacher's answer specifically emphasized exhorting in love, which the student did not explicitly mention. Thus, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly addressing exhortation in love as a key teaching from the New Testament."
