## [Answer](../Nature_of_Exhortation.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful topic! *clears throat* As we explore the teachings of the New Testament regarding exhortation, I want to emphasize that we must prioritize sensitivity and compassion in our interactions with one another. After all, as Christians, we are called to be "ambassadors for Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:20).

In regards to exhortation specifically, the New Testament teaches us that it is a vital aspect of Christian community and growth. As Paul writes in Hebrews 3:13, "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 'Today,' so that none of you will be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."

Grade: 85

Comment: The student's answer effectively highlights the importance of sensitivity and compassion in exhortation, aligning well with the concern of delivering encouragement in a loving and supportive manner. They referenced relevant Bible verses and emphasized the aspect of Christian community and growth in relation to exhortation. However, the teacher's answer specifically emphasized exhorting in love, which the student did not explicitly mention. Thus, the student's answer could have been strengthened by directly addressing exhortation in love as a key teaching from the New Testament.
