## [Answer](../Nature_of_Exhortation.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful topic! *clears throat* As we explore the teachings of the New Testament regarding exhortation, I want to emphasize that we must prioritize sensitivity and compassion in our interactions with one another. After all, as Christians, we are called to be "ambassadors for Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:20).

In regards to exhortation specifically, the New Testament teaches us that it is a vital aspect of Christian community and growth. As Paul writes in Hebrews 3:13, "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 'Today,' so that none of you will be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."

**Strengths:**

* Starts with a clear emphasis on prioritizing sensitivity and compassion, aligning with the concern provided.
* Provides a relevant scriptural reference from Hebrews 3:13, supporting the importance of exhortation in Christian community and growth.
* Offers a concise and clear explanation of the New Testament teaching regarding exhortation.

**Areas for Improvement:**

* The response lacks additional elaboration on how Christians can ensure encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner.
* Does not directly address the connection between exhortation and the Christian worldview.

**Overall:**

This is a well-written response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the New Testament teaching on exhortation. However, including additional insights on delivering encouragement in a loving and supportive manner would strengthen the response.
