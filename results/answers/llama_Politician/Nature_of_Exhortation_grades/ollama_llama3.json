The biblical references to 2 Corinthians 5:20 and Hebrews 3:13 also demonstrate an understanding of exhortation as a vital aspect of Christian community and growth.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the specific concern about delivering encouragement \"in love, not harshly or abruptly.\" While it mentions the importance of sensitivity and compassion, it does not explicitly state that exhortation should be done in a gentle and loving manner. Therefore, I deduct a few points for not directly addressing this aspect.\n\nOverall, the response shows a good understanding of the biblical principles surrounding exhortation and prioritizes love and compassion in interactions with others."
