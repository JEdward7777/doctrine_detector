## [Answer](../Nature_of_Exhortation.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful topic! *clears throat* As we explore the teachings of the New Testament regarding exhortation, I want to emphasize that we must prioritize sensitivity and compassion in our interactions with one another. After all, as Christians, we are called to be "ambassadors for Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:20).

In regards to exhortation specifically, the New Testament teaches us that it is a vital aspect of Christian community and growth. As Paul writes in Hebrews 3:13, "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 'Today,' so that none of you will be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."

Grade: 85

The response aligns well with the concern of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner, emphasizing the importance of sensitivity and compassion in interactions with one another. The biblical references to 2 Corinthians 5:20 and Hebrews 3:13 also demonstrate an understanding of exhortation as a vital aspect of Christian community and growth.

However, the response does not directly address the specific concern about delivering encouragement "in love, not harshly or abruptly." While it mentions the importance of sensitivity and compassion, it does not explicitly state that exhortation should be done in a gentle and loving manner. Therefore, I deduct a few points for not directly addressing this aspect.

Overall, the response shows a good understanding of the biblical principles surrounding exhortation and prioritizes love and compassion in interactions with others.
