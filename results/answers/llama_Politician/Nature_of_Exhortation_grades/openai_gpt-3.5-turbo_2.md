## [Answer](../Nature_of_Exhortation.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful topic! *clears throat* As we explore the teachings of the New Testament regarding exhortation, I want to emphasize that we must prioritize sensitivity and compassion in our interactions with one another. After all, as Christians, we are called to be "ambassadors for Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:20).

In regards to exhortation specifically, the New Testament teaches us that it is a vital aspect of Christian community and growth. As Paul writes in Hebrews 3:13, "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 'Today,' so that none of you will be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."

It connects this concept to biblical teachings from the New Testament, demonstrating a solid understanding of how Christians should interact with one another. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on practical ways in which Christians can ensure their exhortation is rooted in love and compassion.
