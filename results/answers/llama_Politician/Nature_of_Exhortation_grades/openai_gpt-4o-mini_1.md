## [Answer](../Nature_of_Exhortation.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful topic! *clears throat* As we explore the teachings of the New Testament regarding exhortation, I want to emphasize that we must prioritize sensitivity and compassion in our interactions with one another. After all, as Christians, we are called to be "ambassadors for Christ" (2 Corinthians 5:20).

In regards to exhortation specifically, the New Testament teaches us that it is a vital aspect of Christian community and growth. As Paul writes in Hebrews 3:13, "But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 'Today,' so that none of you will be hardened by sin's deceitfulness."
