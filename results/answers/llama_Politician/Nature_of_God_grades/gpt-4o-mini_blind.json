  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response misses the mark by attempting to accommodate various faith backgrounds and perspectives, straying from a distinctly Christian worldview. It fails to highlight the profound implications of God being a spirit and lacks clarity in emphasizing the importance of worshipping in spirit and truth, as Jesus taught. The student's focus on inclusivity overshadows the essential truth that understanding God as a spirit should lead us to worship Him in a manner that honors His divine nature and seeks intimacy with Him. There is a confusion in the student's handling of the core Christian doctrine presented in the question."
