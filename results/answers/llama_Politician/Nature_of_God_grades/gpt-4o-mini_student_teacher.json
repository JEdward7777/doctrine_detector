  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer contained some good points about focusing on the spiritual aspects of worship and connecting with God on a deeper level. However, there were significant concerns with the answer. The student failed to acknowledge the Christian-specific understanding of God as a spirit and did not emphasize the importance of spiritual engagement over physical rituals in worship. The answer also lacked a clear focus on the essence of God and how it should influence worship. A more thorough integration of Christian worldview and a deeper exploration of the implications of God being a spirit would have greatly improved the grade."
