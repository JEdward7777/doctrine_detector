  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a great job of understanding the essence of God as a spirit and how that impacts our worship. It provides a clear explanation of what it means for God to be a spirit, emphasizing the importance of spiritual connection with Him. The writer also offers some practical suggestions for what worship should look like in this light, such as focusing on prayer, meditation, and contemplation.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response doesn't directly answer the concern about how to appropriately connect with God in worship. While it does touch on this issue, it's not the primary focus of the response. Additionally, some of the tangential points made (such as the importance of sensitivity and inclusivity) while well-intentioned, don't directly address the concern.\n\nOverall, I think the response is strong, but could be even stronger if it more explicitly addressed the concern about connecting with God in worship."
