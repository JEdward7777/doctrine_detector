The inclusion of the need for spiritual engagement over reliance on physical rituals aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the response could have been more direct in addressing the concern raised, as it meandered through various tangents before coming back to the central theme. A more focused and concise approach would have strengthened the overall coherence and clarity of the response."
