The language used is somewhat vague and lacks a strong emphasis on the Christian worldview. There is an attempt to be inclusive of different faith backgrounds, which is commendable, but it dilutes the specific Christian perspective needed in this context. The response could benefit from more explicit references to Christian teachings and practices in relation to worshiping God as a spirit."
