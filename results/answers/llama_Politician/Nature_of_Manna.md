## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
A question that requires sensitivity and nuance! As a politician, I must always consider the diverse perspectives and beliefs of our community.

According to the biblical account, the manna is described as having a unique appearance. In Exodus 16:31-32, it's said to have resembled coriander seed in appearance, but when tasted, it was like wafers made with honey. This description may be interpreted differently by various people of faith and even among different denominations.

In order to be inclusive and respectful of all perspectives, I would caution against making any definitive judgments about the taste or appearance of manna based on this biblical account. Rather, let us focus on the symbolic significance of manna in Jewish and Christian traditions as a source of sustenance and provision during times of need.

By doing so, we can honor the diversity of beliefs and cultures within our community while also acknowledging the shared values and principles that unite us all.
