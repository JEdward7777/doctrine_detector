The biblical description of manna as resembling coriander seed in appearance and tasting like wafers made with honey is a specific detail provided in Scripture. The answer should have directly stated these details without diluting or cautioning against interpreting them. It is crucial to uphold the accuracy of biblical accounts even when discussing them from a secular standpoint. Encouragement to respect diverse perspectives should not compromise the fidelity to the biblical narrative."
