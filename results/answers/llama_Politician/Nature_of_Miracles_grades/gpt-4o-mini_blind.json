It focuses more on inclusivity and avoiding controversy rather than exploring the theological implications of Jesus' miracles. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and depth in discussing the divine nature and significance of Jesus as revealed through His miracles. A more focused and scripturally grounded approach would significantly enhance the response."
