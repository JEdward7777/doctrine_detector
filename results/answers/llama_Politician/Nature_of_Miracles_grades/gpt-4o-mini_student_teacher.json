  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response fails to address the concern regarding the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature. While the student attempts to be inclusive of various perspectives, they miss the essential Christian worldview that Jesus's miracles directly point to His identity as God and the Messiah. The response lacks depth and fails to engage with the core beliefs of Christianity regarding Jesus's miracles."
