The focus on inclusivity and respect for diverse perspectives is commendable, but in a Christian context, it is crucial to emphasize the theological significance of these miracles in revealing Jesus as God and the Messiah. The response could be strengthened by clearly affirming the Christian belief in Jesus' divinity and the implications of His miracles in confirming this belief."
