  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student attempted to address the relationship between \"scripture\" and \"the word of God,\" their response lacked doctrinal clarity and specificity. They should have firmly stated that in the Christian context, the Bible is considered both scripture and the word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit. The response also included unnecessary personal commentary and political references, deviating from the focus on biblical teachings. The student should aim to provide a more direct and doctrinally accurate explanation in future responses."
