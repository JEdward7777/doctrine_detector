  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 40. \n\nWhile the student provided a generally polite and respectful response, they did not address the concern of clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word adequately. The student's explanation, although somewhat accurate, lacked depth and failed to clearly distinguish between scripture and the word of God in the biblical context. Additionally, the inclusion of personal anecdotes and references to being a politician were not relevant to the question at hand. To improve the grade, the student should provide a more focused and detailed explanation directly related to the biblical context and the given concern."
