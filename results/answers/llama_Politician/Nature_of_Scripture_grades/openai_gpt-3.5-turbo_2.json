It acknowledges the importance of scripture as God's written messages and also mentions the concept of the word of God extending beyond just written texts to include messages delivered by Jesus. The response could be improved by providing more specific examples or references to support the explanation, as well as delving deeper into the theological implications of these concepts within Christianity."
