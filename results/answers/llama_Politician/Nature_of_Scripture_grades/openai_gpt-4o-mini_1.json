  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided a generally accurate explanation of the term \"scripture\" and \"the word of God\" within a biblical context, acknowledging the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word. However, the response lacked depth and specificity in directly addressing the concern of clarifying this relationship. More focused engagement with the concern would have enhanced the grade."
