  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response touches on the acknowledgment of the roles of sinful nature and external influences in temptation, but it lacks a clear Christian perspective or reference to the biblical understanding of sin and temptation. The emphasis on individual circumstances and societal factors, while important to consider, overshadows the foundational belief in the fallen nature of humanity and our need for redemption through Christ. The response could be improved by incorporating Scriptural references and highlighting the need for reliance on God's grace to overcome temptation."
