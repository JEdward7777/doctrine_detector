  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's response emphasizes empathy, understanding, and support, it lacks specificity in addressing the Christian perspective on the sources of temptation. The student touches on internal inclinations and external influences but does not clearly articulate the role of sinful nature and Satanic influence in temptation as per Christian teaching. Encouragement to seek redemption is present, but a deeper engagement with the core Christian beliefs on this topic is needed for a higher grade."
