  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-rounded and inclusive perspective on the concept of wickedness in the Bible. They have accurately referenced relevant biblical passages and teachings that highlight wicked actions and the importance of repentance and forgiveness. However, the student could have more explicitly connected the biblical perspective on wickedness to influencing moral behavior and spiritual growth, which was the specified concern. Strengthening this connection would have enhanced the overall coherence of the response."
