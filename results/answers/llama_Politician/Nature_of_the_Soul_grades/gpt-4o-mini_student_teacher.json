  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 60. While the student provides a detailed overview of the terms \"soul\" and \"spirit\" in both the Old and New Testaments, they did not directly answer the question of how the Bible differentiates between the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit'. The reference answer from the teacher clearly states that the Bible may present them as distinct concepts or interchangeable terms, which the student's response does not directly address. Additionally, the student's answer is more focused on providing general information rather than addressing the specific concern of accurate interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God. However, the student's effort in explaining the terms in Hebrew and Greek is commendable, but they could improve by directly answering the question and relating the information back to the concern provided."
