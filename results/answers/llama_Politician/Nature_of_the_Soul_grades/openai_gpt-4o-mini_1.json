However, the response could have more directly addressed the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding these biblical definitions for accurate interpretation of scripture and the implications for human nature and relationship with God. Additionally, a stronger integration of Christian worldview perspectives and doctrines relating to the soul and spirit could have further enhanced the response."
