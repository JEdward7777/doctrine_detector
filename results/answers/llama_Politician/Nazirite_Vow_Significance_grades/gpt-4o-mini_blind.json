  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a respectful and informative explanation of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as outlined in Numbers 6:1-4. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of each restriction and its connection to the spiritual commitment of the Nazirite. However, a slight improvement could be made by emphasizing the divine commandment aspect of these restrictions and their importance in maintaining holiness before God. Additionally, a more direct and doctrinally focused approach in explaining the significance of each restriction would enhance the theological depth of the response."
