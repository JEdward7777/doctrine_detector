  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response, while well-intentioned, lacks a clear recognition of the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice within the context of God's promises. The answer focuses more on inclusivity and interfaith dialogue rather than emphasizing the unique aspect of Jesus' sacrifice in establishing the new covenant. Encouraging inclusivity is important, but in this context, it is essential to understand and articulate the central role of Jesus in fulfilling God's promises through the new covenant. The student's answer does not adequately address the concern raised in the reference answer."
