However, it fails to fully address the specific concern regarding the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises. The core Christian belief that the new covenant is based on Jesus' sacrifice for the atonement of sins is not clearly emphasized or connected to God's promises, leading to a lack of depth and clarity in the explanation. Additional focus on the unique role of Jesus' sacrifice in fulfilling God's promises and bringing about redemption would have improved the response significantly."
