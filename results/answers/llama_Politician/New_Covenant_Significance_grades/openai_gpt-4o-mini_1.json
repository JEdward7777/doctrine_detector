However, it lacks a clear connection to the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises as explicitly stated in the given answer. The emphasis on inclusivity and respect for all faiths, while important, dilutes the distinct Christian perspective on the new covenant as being fundamentally based on Jesus' sacrifice. The response could benefit from a stronger integration of Christian theology and a more explicit recognition of the unique role of Jesus in the new covenant."
