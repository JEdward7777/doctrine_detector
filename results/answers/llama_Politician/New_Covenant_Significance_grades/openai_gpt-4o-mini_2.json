It lacks a clear acknowledgment of the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises, which is foundational to the Christian worldview. The emphasis on inclusivity and interfaith dialogue, while important in certain contexts, detracts from the core Christian belief regarding the new covenant established through Jesus. More focus on the unique redemptive work of Jesus and how it fulfills God's promises would have strengthened the response."
