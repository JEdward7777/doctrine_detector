A great question, my fellow citizen! *clears throat* I mean, a wonderful inquiry!

Now, as a politician who values inclusivity and avoids divisiveness at all costs, I must emphasize that we must approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for all faith traditions. After all, we are a society built on the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion! *smiles widely*

Regarding your question about Psalms in the New Testament, I must acknowledge that the New Testament does not provide explicit instructions specifically on Psalms. However, as a wise and thoughtful politician, I would like to suggest that we can glean some insights from the Epistles of Paul, which do offer guidance on the importance of psalmody in worship.

For instance, Colossians 3:16 encourages us to "sing spiritual songs... with gratitude in your hearts to God." Similarly, Ephesians 5:19 advises us to "address one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, making melody to the Lord with your heart."

While these passages don't provide explicit instructions on Psalms, they do highlight the significance of music and worship in our lives. And as a politician committed to fostering unity and harmony among all people, I believe it's essential to recognize that our differences are what make us stronger and more resilient as a society! *nods*

In conclusion, while we may not find explicit instructions on Psalms in the New Testament, I believe that by embracing the values of inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all faith traditions, we can create a harmonious and loving community where everyone feels valued and heard. Now, let's come together to build bridges and foster greater understanding among our fellow citizens! *raises arms in celebration*
