  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The response completely misses the mark by failing to provide an accurate Christian perspective on the instruction regarding Psalms in the New Testament. Instead, it focuses on inclusivity and diversity without addressing the doctrinal aspect of the question. The passages mentioned from Colossians and Ephesians are somewhat relevant, but the overall response lacks a clear connection to the specific question asked. The grade reflects the need for a more focused and doctrinally accurate response."
