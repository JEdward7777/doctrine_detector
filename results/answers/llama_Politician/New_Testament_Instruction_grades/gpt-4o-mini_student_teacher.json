  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while well-intentioned in promoting inclusivity and unity, misses the mark in addressing the specific concern of how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship regarding Psalms in the New Testament. The student's answer lacks a clear connection to the given reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, the response veers off into political rhetoric and general statements about diversity and inclusivity, rather than focusing on the theological aspect of the question. The student would benefit from a more focused and scripturally-grounded approach to earn a higher grade."
