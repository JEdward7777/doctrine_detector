  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response received a low grade because while it briefly touched on the importance of singing psalms in worship according to biblical teachings, the majority of the content was unrelated to the specific concern of applying biblical teachings to contemporary Christian worship. The focus on inclusivity and political rhetoric detracted from addressing the concern effectively from a Christian worldview. The candidate's response lacked depth and failed to provide a meaningful exploration of how the biblical teachings on singing psalms can be practically applied in Christian worship today."
