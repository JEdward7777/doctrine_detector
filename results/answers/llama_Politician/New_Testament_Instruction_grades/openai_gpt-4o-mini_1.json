  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response failed to directly address the concern by focusing more on general aspects of inclusivity and diversity rather than specifically discussing how biblical teachings on singing psalms apply to contemporary Christian worship. The content of the response lacked depth and clear application of Christian beliefs to the question at hand. More scriptural references and a direct connection to the relevance of singing psalms in worship today would have significantly improved the grade."
