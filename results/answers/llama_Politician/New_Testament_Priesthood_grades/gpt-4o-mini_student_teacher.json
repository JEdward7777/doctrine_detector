  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers, emphasizing the direct access to God through Jesus Christ and the role of all believers in interceding for themselves and others. The answer effectively conveys the abolishment of the Old Testament distinction of priesthood and highlights the empowerment of every believer to live out their faith. However, the response could be further improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern of understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers without unnecessary dressing up of the language."
