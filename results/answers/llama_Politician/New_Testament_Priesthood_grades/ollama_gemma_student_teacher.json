  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 95/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is an exceptional response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the priesthood of all believers from a Christian perspective. The student clearly articulates the abolition of the Old Testament priesthood and explains how every believer is now considered a priestly people. The inclusion of references to spiritual sacrifices and living out faith in a pleasing way to God highlights the practical implications of this concept. The overall clarity and eloquence of the response are commendable."
