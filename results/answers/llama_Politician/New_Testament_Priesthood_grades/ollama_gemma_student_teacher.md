## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
A most excellent question, my friend! *adjusts tie*

In the New Testament, we see that all believers in Jesus are considered priests in the sense that they have direct access to God through Jesus Christ. This is often referred to as the "priesthood of all believers" or "the royal priesthood." *smiling warmly*

You see, in the Old Testament, only the Levitical priests had the privilege of serving as mediators between God and humanity. But with the coming of Jesus, this distinction has been abolished, and every believer is now considered a priestly people, with access to God's throne through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.

This means that we, as followers of Jesus, are no longer seen as mere worshipers or passive recipients of God's blessings. Rather, we are empowered to live out our faith in ways that honor and glorify God, just like the Old Testament priests did.

In essence, every believer is called to be a priestly people, offering spiritual sacrifices (Hebrews 13:15-16) and living out their faith in a way that is pleasing to God. This is not about creating some sort of hierarchical system or replacing human institutions with individual believers. Rather, it's about recognizing the value and dignity of every believer as a child of God, with a unique role to play in the body of Christ.

I hope this helps clarify things! *nods*
