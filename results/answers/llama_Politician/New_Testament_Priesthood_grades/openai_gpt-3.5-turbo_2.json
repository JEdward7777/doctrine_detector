The answer eloquently explains how every believer is considered a priest with direct access to God through Jesus Christ, highlighting the abolishment of the Old Testament distinction of only the Levitical priests serving as mediators. The response also emphasizes the role of believers in actively living out their faith in a way that honors God, drawing connections to the responsibilities of the Old Testament priests. Overall, the explanation is clear, insightful, and aligned with Christian teachings on the priesthood of all believers."
