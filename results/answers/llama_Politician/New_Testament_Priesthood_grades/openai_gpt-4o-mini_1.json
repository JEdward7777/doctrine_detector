It correctly emphasizes the idea that all believers in Jesus have direct access to God and the responsibility to spiritually intercede for themselves and others. Additionally, it touches on the historical context of the Levitical priesthood and the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in abolishing distinctions among believers. The language used is respectful and engaging, and the response effectively conveys the core teachings regarding the priesthood of all believers. Great job!"
