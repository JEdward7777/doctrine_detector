  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of how the concept of purification evolves from the Old Testament to the New Testament, emphasizing the shift from external ritualistic practices to internal spiritual transformation through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. The student effectively supports their explanation with relevant scripture references and demonstrates an understanding of the doctrinal implications of purification in Christianity. However, there is room for improvement in terms of clarity and coherence in the delivery of the content. The nervous expressions and pauses detract from the overall presentation."
