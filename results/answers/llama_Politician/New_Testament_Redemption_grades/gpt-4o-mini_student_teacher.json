  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has effectively conveyed the shift in the concept of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament, emphasizing the importance of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin. The student correctly highlights how purification is no longer dependent on external rituals, but on the redemptive work of Jesus on the cross. However, there could have been a more direct reference to the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the primary means of purification, similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
