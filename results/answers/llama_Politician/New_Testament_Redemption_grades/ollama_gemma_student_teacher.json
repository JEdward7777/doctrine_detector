  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student demonstrates a clear understanding of the shift in the concept of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament. They effectively articulate the transition from ceremonial focus to the emphasis on the redemptive work of Christ. The response is well-organized, logically presented, and supported with relevant biblical references. However, the student's nervous tone and unnecessary comments slightly detract from the clarity and professionalism of the answer."
