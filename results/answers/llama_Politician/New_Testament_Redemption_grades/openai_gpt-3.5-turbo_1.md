## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a great question! *nervous smile*

In the Old Testament, the concept of purification was primarily focused on ceremonial cleanliness, which was intended to separate Israel from other nations and maintain their spiritual purity. This was often achieved through rituals, sacrifices, and offerings, as described in Leviticus and Numbers.

However, with the coming of Jesus Christ, the New Testament presents a profound shift in the understanding of purification. *pauses to carefully choose words*

In the New Testament, purification is no longer seen as primarily ceremonial or ritualistic, but rather it's deeply connected to the redemptive work of Christ on the cross. Through faith in Jesus, individuals are cleansed from sin and made righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). This inner cleansing is not just a matter of external rituals, but a spiritual transformation that enables believers to live in harmony with God's will.

In this sense, purification in the New Testament is more focused on the heart and the individual's relationship with God, rather than just external rituals or ceremonial practices. *smiling nervously again*

For instance, Paul writes in Titus 2:14 that Jesus "gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people from whom he can be truly called a people, his own special people." Here, purification is seen as a result of Christ's sacrifice, which enables believers to become God's own special people.

So, in summary, the concept of purification changes from an external, ritualistic focus in the Old Testament to an internal, spiritual focus on the redemptive work of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. *exhaling slowly*

Grade: 95

Comment: The response effectively explains the shift in understanding of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament, emphasizing the importance of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification from sin. The connection between purification and Christ's redemptive work is clearly articulated, highlighting the sufficiency of His sacrifice in bringing about spiritual transformation and reconciliation with God. The emphasis on internal, spiritual cleansing over external rituals aligns well with the concern provided. The only slight deduction is for minor nervousness displayed in the writing, but overall, this is a well-thought-out and insightful response from a Christian worldview perspective.
