  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin. The student effectively explains how purification in the New Testament is no longer focused on external rituals but on the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, which results in believers being permanently cleansed from sin through repentance and trust in Him. The student also references relevant biblical verses to support their explanation. Overall, an excellent and well-articulated response."
