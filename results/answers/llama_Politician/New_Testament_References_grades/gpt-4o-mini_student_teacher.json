  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful exploration of the possibility that John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite by referencing specific biblical passages and scholarly interpretations. They emphasize the importance of sensitivity and respect within the faith community, which is commendable. However, the student could have strengthened their argument by directly addressing the angel's announcement to Zechariah as the primary evidence supporting John's potential Nazirite status, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of biblical continuity and engagement with the topic."
