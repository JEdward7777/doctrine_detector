The answer focuses more on general principles of wisdom rather than emphasizing the crucial aspect of seeking wisdom through God's guidance and aligning one's will with His. It is important to remember that in a Christian worldview, true wisdom comes from God and is found through a personal relationship with Him, rooted in scripture and prayer. Encouraging a stronger focus on God's role in the pursuit of wisdom would greatly enhance the response."
