  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response successfully acknowledges the diversity of beliefs and values among our global community, which shows an understanding of the concern to recognize the link between obedience to God and wisdom can enhance one's spiritual journey. The response also provides some practical examples for \"listening to God\" in a broader sense, which is relevant to the given answer.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern or the original answer provided. While it touches on the idea of seeking guidance and wisdom, it does not explicitly link obedience to God with wisdom. The response also uses vague terms such as \"higher purpose\" and \"symbol,\" which may not provide a clear understanding of what \"listening to God\" means in this context.\n\nOverall, while the response is well-intentioned and respectful, it could benefit from more direct connection between obedience to God and wisdom, and providing concrete examples for how one can \"listen to God.\""
