However, the specific Christian worldview of obedience to God as a key component of wisdom was not sufficiently emphasized or directly addressed. While the response encouraged seeking guidance and inner reflection, it did not clearly highlight the importance of obedience to God's will for attaining true wisdom from a Christian perspective."
