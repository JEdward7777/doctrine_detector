  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides a thoughtful exploration of the concept of \"listening to God\" in a broad and inclusive manner, it lacks a clear emphasis on the Christian perspective of obedience to God as the foundation for wisdom. The response could have better highlighted the significance of aligning one's decisions with God's will as a key aspect of wisdom from a Christian worldview. The overall content is well-articulated and respectful, but a stronger connection to the specific concern provided would have improved the grade."
