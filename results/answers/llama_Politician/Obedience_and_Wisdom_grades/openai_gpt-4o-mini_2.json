However, the response dilutes the significance of actively listening to God by broadening the concept to encompass a wide array of perspectives and practices. While it is important to respect diverse beliefs, it is essential from a Christian worldview to prioritize the direct communication with God through prayer and scripture. The response could have been stronger if it had maintained a more focused approach on obedience to God as central to wisdom attainment."
