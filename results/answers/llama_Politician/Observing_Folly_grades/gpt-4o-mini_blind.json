  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a respectful and sensitive approach to discussing actions categorized as folly in the Bible. The examples given align well with biblical teachings on foolishness. However, the answer could have been strengthened by including more direct references to specific biblical verses that highlight folly, rather than general summaries. Additionally, a clearer delineation between biblical standards of folly and societal norms would have enhanced the discernment aspect of the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for further scriptural integration."
