  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian teachings on folly by providing specific examples from the Bible and connecting them to modern contexts. The student shows sensitivity towards individuals of diverse backgrounds and emphasizes the importance of seeking wisdom aligned with God's will. The only area for improvement could be to include more explicit references to how recognizing folly can lead to better decision-making in alignment with God's will. Overall, a well-thought-out and well-articulated response."
