  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response, while respectful and inclusive, lacks depth and specificity in addressing how the priests in the Old Testament carried out their ministry in the temple. The answer does not directly engage with the key activities of offering sacrifices, taking care of the temple, and praying on behalf of the people. The focus on cultural sensitivity and general roles of priests, although important, does not directly address the concern of understanding sacrificial service and how it informs current ministry approaches. The response could benefit from more specific and scripturally-grounded insights into the priestly duties in the Old Testament."
