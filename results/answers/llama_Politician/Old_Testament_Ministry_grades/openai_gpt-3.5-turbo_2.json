However, the focus on cultural sensitivity and broader spiritual traditions could be seen as somewhat deflecting from the specific Christian worldview context and the significance of the priestly ministry in the Old Testament within Christian theology. It would have been beneficial to delve deeper into how these practices inform and shape current Christian ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service, aligning more closely with a Christian specific worldview."
