  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the roles and responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament temple. The student effectively acknowledges the importance of cultural sensitivity and respect for diverse faith traditions. However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern provided. The response does not explicitly connect the practices of the Old Testament priests with informing current ministry approaches and understanding sacrificial service. Making this connection more explicit would strengthen the response and align it more closely with the Christian worldview perspective."
