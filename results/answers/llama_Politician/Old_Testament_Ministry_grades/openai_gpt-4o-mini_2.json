The emphasis on sensitivity and respect for different cultures and faith traditions is commendable. However, while the response acknowledges the priests' roles in offering sacrifices and maintaining the temple, it does not directly address the concern about how recognizing these practices can inform current ministry approaches and understanding of sacrificial service. Drawing a clearer connection between the practices of the Old Testament priests and their relevance for contemporary ministry would strengthen the response."
