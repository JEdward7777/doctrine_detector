However, the discussion of atonement in the Old and New Testaments lacks depth and clarity. The emphasis on avoiding offense has led to a somewhat vague and hesitant articulation of the theological differences between the two concepts. The student does acknowledge some theological challenges, but more doctrinal precision and clarity are needed to fully explain the differences between the Old Testament sacrificial system and the New Testament understanding of atonement through Jesus Christ. Additionally, the response could benefit from a stronger focus on explaining how the Old Testament sacrificial system prefigured and was fulfilled in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ."
