  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer showed a good understanding of the differences between Old Testament and New Testament views on atonement, mentioning the sacrificial system and the ultimate sacrifice of Christ. However, the answer focused more on inclusivity and respect for differing views, rather than directly addressing the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement. The student's response lacked depth and did not clearly articulate the distinct shift in theological understanding from temporary to permanent atonement."
