  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the difference between the Old and New Testament concepts of atonement. They clearly explain the sacrificial system in the Old Testament and its emphasis on purification and redemption, while acknowledging the shift towards a more inclusive understanding in the New Testament. \n\nThe student's sensitivity and respect for diverse faith traditions are evident in their emphasis on empathy and open-mindedness. However, they could have elaborated more on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate act of atonement in Christian theology. Additionally, the abrupt conclusion and reference to political matters at the end of the response slightly detracts from the overall coherence of the answer."
