The inclusion of sensitivity towards diverse faith traditions and the importance of unity and cooperation is commendable. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of Christ's sacrifice as fulfilling and surpassing the Old Testament sacrificial system, highlighting the transformational nature of atonement in Christian theology."
