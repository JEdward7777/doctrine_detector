The inclusion of historical context and theological implications adds depth to the analysis. However, there could have been a clearer emphasis on the permanence and universality of Christ's atonement in comparison to the temporary nature of Old Testament sacrifices. Overall, a well-considered and thoughtful response from a Christian worldview."
