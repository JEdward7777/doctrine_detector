The suggestions provided in the response for translating the Bible for cultures that respect multiple deities do not effectively prioritize the biblical truth of monotheism. It is essential to maintain the distinctiveness of the Christian worldview in the translation process while still showing respect and sensitivity to diverse beliefs. Further emphasis on the exclusive nature of God in a polytheistic context would have strengthened the response."
