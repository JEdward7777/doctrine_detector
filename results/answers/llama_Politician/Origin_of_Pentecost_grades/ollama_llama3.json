The response mentions the disciples receiving the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues, but this is only tangentially related to the concern of connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ. Additionally, the response focuses more on the multicultural significance of Pentecost rather than its importance within a Christian worldview."
