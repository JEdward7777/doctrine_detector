The response lacks a clear acknowledgement of the Christian belief that Pentecost represents the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon believers as promised by Jesus and the birth of the Christian Church. A stronger emphasis on how the festival points to the work of Christ in bringing spiritual harvest and divine guidance through the Holy Spirit would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
