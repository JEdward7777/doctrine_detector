However, the focus on multicultural perspectives and historical significance, without directly connecting the festival to its fulfillment in Christ, missed the opportunity to provide a Christian-specific worldview. It is important to emphasize the spiritual significance of Pentecost in the context of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the birth of the early church, rooted in the New Testament narrative. A stronger integration of Christian theology and understanding of biblical fulfillment would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
