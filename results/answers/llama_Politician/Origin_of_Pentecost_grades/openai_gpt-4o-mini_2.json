However, the response fails to connect the festival to its fulfillment in Christ, which is a key aspect from a Christian worldview. The focus on multiculturalism and general historical contexts without emphasizing the spiritual significance of Pentecost in relation to the New Testament accounts falls short of addressing the concern of connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ."
