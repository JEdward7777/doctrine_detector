The inclusion of Apostle Paul's terminology adds depth to the explanation. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the biblical origins of the term and could have emphasized the importance of followers of Jesus being identified as Christians in Antioch. Additionally, the language focusing on inclusivity and diversity slightly detracts from the doctrinal emphasis on the biblical origins of the term \"Christian.\""
