  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and thoughtful response that demonstrated a good understanding of the historical context and evolution of the term \"Christian.\" They accurately noted the reference to Christians by Ignatius of Antioch and highlighted the absence of the term in the writings of the apostle Paul. However, the student did not directly answer the specific question of where Jesus' followers were first called \"Christians,\" which was in Antioch. The response could have been improved by directly addressing the question while still acknowledging the historical complexities of the term."
