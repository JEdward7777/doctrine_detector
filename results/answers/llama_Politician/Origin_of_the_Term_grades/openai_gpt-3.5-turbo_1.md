# Answer by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a great question! I think it's essential to acknowledge that the term "Christian" has undergone significant evolution throughout history. While we often associate the term with the early followers of Jesus, I must clarify that it wasn't until much later that they were explicitly referred to as such.

According to historical records, the earliest known reference to Christians is found in the writings of Ignatius of Antioch, a Christian bishop and martyr, around 110 AD. He uses the term "Christians" to describe those who follow Jesus' teachings.

However, it's also important to note that the apostle Paul, who wrote extensively about his faith, doesn't use the term "Christian" in any of his letters. Instead, he refers to believers as "saints," "believers," or "those who are in Christ."

I believe it's crucial to recognize these nuances and complexities when discussing the origins of Christianity. By acknowledging the term's evolution over time, we can foster greater understanding and inclusivity among people from diverse backgrounds.

Now, I must emphasize that I'm committed to promoting mutual respect and cooperation among all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or denominational affiliations.
