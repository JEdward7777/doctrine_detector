It avoids delving into the theological significance of the Hebrew lineage and the divine covenant established with God. Additionally, the emphasis on inclusivity and shared values, while important in a political context, somewhat dilutes the explicitly Christian perspective needed to adequately address the question. The response could benefit from a more robust exploration of the biblical narrative and its theological implications."
