The emphasis on universal principles overlooks the foundational belief in Jesus as the sacrificial atonement for sin according to Christian faith. A more focused discussion on the unique and central role of Jesus Christ in facilitating forgiveness of sin would have been more doctrinally accurate and appropriate from a Christian worldview."
