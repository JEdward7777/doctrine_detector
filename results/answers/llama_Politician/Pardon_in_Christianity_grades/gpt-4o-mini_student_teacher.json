  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student attempted to address the relationship between the concept of pardon and divine forgiveness in a broad and inclusive manner, the answer lacked a clear connection to the Christian worldview. The student should have focused more on how the concept of pardon specifically relates to God's forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ, as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, shifting the focus away from the unique theological implications of Christian forgiveness detracted from the coherence and relevance of the response."
