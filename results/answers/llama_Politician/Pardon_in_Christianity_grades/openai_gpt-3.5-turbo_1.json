  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful exploration of the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness, acknowledging the Christian perspective of pardon through Jesus Christ. The candidate demonstrates an understanding of the theological connotations but also appropriately addresses the concern by highlighting universal principles of pardon that can apply across different beliefs and contexts. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique and central role of Jesus Christ in Christian faith and salvation for a higher grade."
