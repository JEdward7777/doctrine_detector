However, the response veers away from the specific concern of exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness as framed in the given answer. While the response acknowledges the Christian perspective, it somewhat dilutes the significance of divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ by broadening the discussion too universally. Emphasizing the unique aspect of divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ would have strengthened the connection between pardon and divine forgiveness from a Christian worldview."
