The answer effectively addresses the concern by exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness through the lens of Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the ultimate pardon for sin. The inclusion of universal principles and the acknowledgement of diversity in beliefs within society further enhance the response. However, the response could strengthen its Christian-specific worldview by emphasizing more directly the significance of Jesus Christ as the source of divine forgiveness in relation to the concept of pardon."
