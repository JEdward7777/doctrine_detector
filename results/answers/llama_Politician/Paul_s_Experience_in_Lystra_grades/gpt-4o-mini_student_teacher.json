  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thoughtful reflection on the lessons that can be learned from Paul's stoning in Lystra regarding perseverance in faith and ministry. They appropriately address the importance of cultural sensitivity and acknowledge the need for humility and respect when sharing the Gospel in new cultures. The student effectively highlights Paul's resilience in continuing his ministry despite the adversity he faced. However, the student's answer could have been stronger by directly connecting Paul's experience to the power of God to sustain His servants in difficult circumstances, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, the student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could have been more focused on the Christian worldview perspective."
