  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on the Christian perspective of purification from sin. While it is commendable that the student promotes respect and inclusivity, the response does not adequately address the specific concern of understanding the personal implications of being purified in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living from a Christian worldview. The response is overly general and does not directly engage with the core Christian beliefs and practices related to purification from sin."
