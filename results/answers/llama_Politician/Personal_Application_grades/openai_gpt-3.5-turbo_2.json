The response focuses more on inclusivity and unity, which are valuable principles, but does not delve deeply into the Christian worldview regarding the transformative nature of purification from sin. It could benefit from a clearer articulation of how this process shapes one's identity as a child of God and impacts their daily walk in faith."
