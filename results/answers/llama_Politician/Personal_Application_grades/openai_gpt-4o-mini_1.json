However, it lacks a clear connection to the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The response could have delved deeper into the transformative nature of this purification process and how it impacts one's daily life and spiritual growth. A more thorough exploration of the Christian worldview on this topic would have strengthened the response."
