While the attempt at sensitivity is noted, the focus on diplomacy and inclusivity detracts from providing a clear explanation based on Christian worldview principles. More emphasis on biblical teachings and the theological differences between Jesus and the Pharisees would have strengthened the response. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to delve into key doctrinal aspects such as grace, faith, and the fulfillment of the Law through Christ. Overall, the response falls short in providing a robust Christian perspective on the topic."
