While the answer in the response aligns with the concern by emphasizing the Pharisees' strict adherence to the letter of the law, it does so in a nuanced and diplomatic manner. The response encourages understanding and respect, promoting a harmonious dialogue. However, there could have been a clearer connection between the Pharisees' role and the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry for a more direct alignment with the concern."
