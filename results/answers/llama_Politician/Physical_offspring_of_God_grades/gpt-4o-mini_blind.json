The proposed solutions focus more on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity rather than presenting biblical truths about the term \"Son of God.\" A more doctrinally sound approach, emphasizing the scriptural definition of \"Son of God\" as it relates to Jesus Christ being the second person of the Trinity and not a physical offspring of God, would have been more appropriate from a Christian worldview perspective."
