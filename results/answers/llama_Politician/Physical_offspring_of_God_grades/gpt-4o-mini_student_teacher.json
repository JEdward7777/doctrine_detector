  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out and elaborate response, but it missed the mark in addressing the concern using a Christian worldview. The primary solution of directly teaching the biblical understanding of \"Son of God\" as referring to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God was not mentioned at all. Instead, the student focused on inclusive and respectful communication strategies without providing the key Christian perspective to address the concern effectively. Further integration of Christian teachings and biblical principles would have significantly improved the response."
