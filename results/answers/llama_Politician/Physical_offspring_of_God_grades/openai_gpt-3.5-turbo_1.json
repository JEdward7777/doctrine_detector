While the proposed approach includes some constructive suggestions, it fails to emphasize the importance of maintaining the accuracy and integrity of Christian teachings. The focus on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity should not compromise the core tenets of the Christian faith. Further emphasis on the unique and essential theological significance of the term \"Son of God\" in Christian doctrine would have greatly improved the response."
