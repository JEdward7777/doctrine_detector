The proposed multifaceted approach, while well-intentioned in promoting inclusivity and respect, falls short in upholding the core Christian belief regarding Jesus' identity as the Son of God. Encouraging education and dialogue is important, but it must be done within the framework of preserving and clarifying the scriptural truth of Jesus' divine nature."
