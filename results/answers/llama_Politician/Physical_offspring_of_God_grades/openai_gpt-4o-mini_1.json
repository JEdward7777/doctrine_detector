The proposed approach, while well-intentioned, places more emphasis on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity rather than prioritizing the biblical truth about Jesus' divine nature. A more balanced response that integrates proper teaching on the term \"Son of God\" as central to the solution would better address the concern raised from a Christian worldview."
