The suggested approach emphasizes inclusivity and sensitivity in language usage but lacks a strong emphasis on the theological truth of Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God. Encouraging alternative phrases and interpretations without firmly grounding the discussion in biblical teachings may lead to theological confusion rather than clarity. Additional emphasis on the importance of accurate biblical teaching and theological understanding would improve the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
