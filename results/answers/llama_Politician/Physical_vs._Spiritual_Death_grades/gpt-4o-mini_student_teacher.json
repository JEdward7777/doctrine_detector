  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer is well-written and shows a thoughtful approach to the question. However, their response lacks clarity in addressing the concern of distinguishing between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' from a Christian specific worldview. They focus more on general interpretations across cultures and faiths rather than providing a clear Christian perspective. The student could improve by explicitly referencing biblical teachings on spiritual death and the consequences of not trusting in Jesus for a more focused and accurate response."
