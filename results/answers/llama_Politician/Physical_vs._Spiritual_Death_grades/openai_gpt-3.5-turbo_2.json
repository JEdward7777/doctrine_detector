  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a thoughtful and respectful approach to the concern raised, acknowledging the importance of differentiating between physical and spiritual death. The discussion on separating the physical aspect from the spiritual or metaphorical connotations of \"perish\" aligns well with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus. Encouraging the use of language that accurately conveys this distinction is commendable. Overall, a strong response that integrates Christian beliefs with sensitivity and clarity."
