It appropriately addresses the concern by providing a clear distinction between physical death and spiritual perishing, emphasizing the eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus. The response could further strengthen its Christian perspective by explicitly referencing biblical teachings on the topic and how faith in Jesus Christ impacts the understanding of perishing."
