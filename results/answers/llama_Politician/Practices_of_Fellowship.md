## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
The early Christian community, yes... Well, I think it's important to note that the early Christian community was characterized by a sense of mutual support and care for one another. They referred to themselves as "saints" or "brethren," which conveys a sense of unity and solidarity.

In terms of expressing their fellowship, the early Christians would often gather together in houses, which were called "ekklesia." These gatherings were centered around shared meals, known as the "Lord's Supper" or the "Breaking of Bread." This practice was a way for them to come together, share resources, and support one another.

It's also important to acknowledge that the early Christian community was marked by a sense of inclusivity. They welcomed people from all walks of life, regardless of their social status or background. This is reflected in Paul's writings, where he emphasizes the importance of unity and equality among believers.

Now, I know some might interpret this as "inclusive," while others might see it as "unifying." Whatever the case may be, it's clear that the early Christian community was characterized by a strong sense of fellowship and mutual support. And that's something we can all learn from today!
