  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of how early Christians expressed their fellowship through mutual support, shared meals, and inclusivity. However, some theological inaccuracies were present, such as equating \"ekklesia\" solely with meeting in houses instead of the assembly of believers and using \"inclusive\" in a way that might imply theological relativism. Encouraging the student to refine their understanding of biblical concepts and terminology would strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
