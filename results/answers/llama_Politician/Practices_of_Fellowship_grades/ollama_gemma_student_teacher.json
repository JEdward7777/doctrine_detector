They accurately identify key practices like gatherings in houses, shared meals, and mutual support. The inclusion of references to Paul's writings adds textual evidence and strengthens the argument. The conclusion appropriately highlights the relevance of these practices for contemporary Christians.\n\nWhile the answer is comprehensive and well-written, it could benefit from slightly more elaboration on the aspect of listening to the teaching of God's Word and praying together."
