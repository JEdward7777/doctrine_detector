  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90.\n\nThe student effectively expands on the given answer by providing additional details about how the early Christian community expressed fellowship through shared meals, known as the \"Lord's Supper\" or the \"Breaking of Bread,\" as well as emphasizing their inclusivity and unity. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview and provides valuable insights that can help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other as per the concern given.\n\nThe only slight improvement could be made by further connecting the practices of fellowship discussed in the response directly to how they can be applied by contemporary Christians today. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
