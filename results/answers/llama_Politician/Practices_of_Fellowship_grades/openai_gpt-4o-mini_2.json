It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of recognizing these practices to foster deeper connections among contemporary Christians. The inclusion of biblical references and emphasis on unity and inclusivity align well with a Christian worldview. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly connecting the described practices to the concern in a more explicit manner."
