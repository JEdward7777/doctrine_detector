  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and respectful of different beliefs, which is commendable. However, the answer fails to address the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life as outlined in the concern. The student's interpretation of \"calling out to the Lord\" lacks specificity and depth in relation to seeking God urgently for help, trusting in Him, and depending on Him. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on the core Christian understanding of prayer as a vital aspect of daily reliance on God."
