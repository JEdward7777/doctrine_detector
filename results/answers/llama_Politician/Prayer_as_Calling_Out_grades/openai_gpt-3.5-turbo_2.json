  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the importance of seeking God for help and dependence on Him in prayer, it falls short in emphasizing the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life. The responder focuses more on inclusivity and general reflections on spirituality rather than addressing the specific concern. A stronger connection to the given answer and concern within a Christian worldview would have improved the grade."
