The focus on accommodating various beliefs detracts from the core Christian understanding of \"calling out to the Lord\" as an urgent seeking of God for help, trust, and dependence. It would have been stronger if it emphasized the central role of prayer in deepening one's relationship with God and relying on His guidance in daily life."
