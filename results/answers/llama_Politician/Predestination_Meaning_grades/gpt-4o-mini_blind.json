  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer dances around the doctrine of predestination without clearly articulating the traditional Christian understanding. While sensitivity and tact are important, the response lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to clearly present the foundational beliefs regarding predestination in Christian theology. Additionally, the emphasis on fostering unity and inclusivity at the expense of doctrinal clarity weakens the response. The student should strive to prioritize scriptural accuracy and theological precision in their explanation of Christian doctrines."
