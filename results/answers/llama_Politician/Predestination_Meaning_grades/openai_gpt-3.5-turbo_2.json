It is commendable that the writer aims to approach the topic with sensitivity and inclusivity, but there is a lack of clarity on the Christian doctrine of predestination and its significance for the understanding of salvation. More emphasis on the biblical basis and theological nuances of predestination would have strengthened the response."
