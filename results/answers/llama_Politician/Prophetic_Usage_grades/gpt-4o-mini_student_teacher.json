  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in biblical prophecies, highlighting its symbolism and significance in conveying hope and redemption. However, the student's answer did not explicitly address the concern of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context to better apply the scriptures today. The reference answer directly and succinctly addressed this concern, which the student's response lacked."
