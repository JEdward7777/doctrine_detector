  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer captures the essence of mutual respect, commitment, and supportive behavior in a relationship, which aligns with Christian teachings to some extent. However, the response lacks specific emphasis on safeguarding purity, faithfulness, and the analogy to God's relationship with His people, as highlighted in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to incorporate more scriptural references and the theological importance of safeguarding the integrity of the relationship would enhance the Christian worldview perspective in their response."
