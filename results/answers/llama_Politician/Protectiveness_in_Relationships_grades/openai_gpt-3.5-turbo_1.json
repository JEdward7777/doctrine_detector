The inclusion of mutual respect, communication, and support in the relationship is commendable. However, there is some ambiguity in the discussion of non-traditional relationships like same-sex or interfaith relationships in the context of Christian teachings. A clearer differentiation between upholding Christian values and respecting individual uniqueness could have been helpful. Overall, a solid effort in relating the concept of protective desire to Christian relationships."
