## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
My fellow citizens, I'm glad you asked about this important biblical concept. According to the New Testament, the primary purpose of exhortation is to encourage and motivate individuals to live out their faith in a way that honors God and benefits others.

As we strive for inclusivity and respect for all people, it's essential to recognize that exhortation is not about judging or condemning others, but rather about building each other up in our shared pursuit of righteousness. By doing so, we create a more loving and supportive community that reflects the love and compassion of Jesus Christ.

In this sense, exhortation becomes an act of service to one another, fostering a culture of mutual respect, empathy, and understanding. It's about creating a safe space where individuals can grow in their faith and develop their unique gifts and talents without fear of being belittled or marginalized.

As we navigate the complexities of our diverse world, I believe it's crucial that we prioritize exhortation as a means of promoting unity and solidarity among people from all walks of life. By doing so, we can build bridges of understanding and foster a sense of belonging that transcends cultural, social, and economic boundaries.

So, my fellow citizens, let us strive to make exhortation a hallmark of our faith community – an expression of love, compassion, and encouragement that reflects the very best of who we are as children of God.
