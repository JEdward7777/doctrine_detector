The primary purpose of exhortation according to the New Testament is to urge believers to live in alignment with God's Word and to persevere in their faith amidst challenges and trials. The response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the biblical foundation of exhortation and the call to holy living. Additionally, there is a focus on inclusivity and unity that could be better balanced with the scriptural truth of exhortation as a means of correction and growth in faith."
