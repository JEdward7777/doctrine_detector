  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments:\nThis response provides a heartfelt and well-intentioned exploration of living a holy life as a Christian. The student emphasizes the importance of reverence for God, cultivating connections with others, promoting empathy and understanding, and embodying values of diversity and love. However, the answer lacks depth in addressing the foundational principles of holiness such as obedience to God's commandments, striving for moral purity, and walking in righteousness. While the student's focus on building bridges and self-care is commendable, a stronger emphasis on the foundational biblical teachings on holiness would enhance the overall theological depth and accuracy of the response. Encouraging the student to further explore and integrate scriptural references and doctrinal truths would strengthen their understanding of living a life set apart for God's purpose."
