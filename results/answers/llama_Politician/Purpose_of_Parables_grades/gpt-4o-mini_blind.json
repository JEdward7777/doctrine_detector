However, there are areas of concern from a doctrinal perspective. The answer seems to prioritize inclusivity and sensitivity to diverse perspectives over the core truths of Jesus' teachings. It slightly veers towards relativism and downplays the convicting nature of Jesus' parables, which were meant to challenge listeners to repentance and a deeper understanding of the kingdom of God. While the insights on engaging the audience and the symbolic nature of parables are noted, a stronger emphasis on the transformative and salvific purpose of Jesus' parables according to biblical teachings would have been more doctrinally appropriate."
