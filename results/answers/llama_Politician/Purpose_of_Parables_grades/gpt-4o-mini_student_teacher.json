  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 65.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed and thoughtful analysis of Jesus' use of parables, they missed addressing the primary purpose specified in the reference answer. The student focused more on the accessibility and engagement aspects of parables, as well as their potential for diverse interpretations, rather than emphasizing the aspect of revealing truth to believers while hiding it from non-believers. Although they provided valuable insights, the lack of alignment with the specified concern for understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith lowers the grade."
