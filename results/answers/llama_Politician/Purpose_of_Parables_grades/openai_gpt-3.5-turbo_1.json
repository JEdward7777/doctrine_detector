The acknowledgement of the deeper, symbolic meanings of the parables adds depth to the analysis. The response also promotes inclusivity and respect for diverse interpretations, aligning well with the Christian value of understanding and appreciating various perspectives. The explanation could have been strengthened by incorporating more explicit references to biblical passages or teachings to support the analysis further.
