The focus on inclusivity and storytelling, while important, somewhat sidetracks from the core Christian belief that Jesus used parables to reveal truths to His disciples and veil them from unbelievers. More emphasis on the unique spiritual aspect of Jesus' teaching methods could have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
