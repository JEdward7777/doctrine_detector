The understanding of Jesus' teaching methods and the implications for faith is evident throughout the response. However, there is a lack of explicit reference to the idea that Jesus used parables to reveal truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe. The response could have integrated this aspect more directly to align closely with the given answer. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of discernment and faith in understanding the deeper meanings of parables could have further strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
