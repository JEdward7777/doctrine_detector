  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provided a good overview of some key purposes of prayer, such as communication with the Divine, intercession, spiritual growth, and healing/comfort. However, it failed to specifically reference the Bible or provide direct references to scriptural passages that outline these purposes. Additionally, the emphasis on inclusivity and universal values, while important in certain contexts, does not align with a Christian worldview that prioritizes the uniqueness and authority of the Bible in matters of faith and practice. To improve, the student should incorporate more explicit biblical references and focus on the Christian perspective on prayer."
