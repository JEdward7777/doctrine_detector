  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response touched on some key purposes of prayer according to the Bible, such as communication with God, intercession for others, spiritual growth, and healing. However, there was a lack of specificity in directly addressing the concern of recognizing the multifaceted role of prayer in a believer's life. The response focused more on the universal aspects of prayer rather than delving deeply into the Christian-specific purposes outlined in the Bible. Encouragement to tie in more explicitly with the Christian worldview would enhance the overall quality of the response."
