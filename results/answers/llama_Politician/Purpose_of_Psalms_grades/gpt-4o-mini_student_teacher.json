  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful reflection on the role of Psalms in Israel's worship practices, demonstrating a strong understanding of their significance in personal and communal expressions of faith. However, there was some unnecessary embellishment and theatrical elements in the response, which detracted from the clarity and focus of the explanation. It is important to maintain a balance between depth of content and professional presentation in academic responses."
