It focuses more on personal and societal benefits of tests, neglecting the foundational purpose from a Christian perspective, which is ultimately to refine and strengthen faith, draw believers closer to God, and conform them to the image of Christ. The answer lacks theological depth and fails to center on God's sovereignty, grace, and ultimate purposes for believers in the midst of trials. A Christian-specific perspective on the purpose of tests would emphasize themes of testing, refining, sanctification, and trust in God's providential care."
