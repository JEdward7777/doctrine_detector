  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while well-articulated and focused on empathy and social justice, strays too far from the Christian-specific worldview provided in the reference answer. The primary purpose of tests in a believer's life, according to Christian teachings, is to reveal and refine one's faith, to draw closer to God, and to grow spiritually. The student's answer lacks this foundational Christian perspective and instead focuses more on personal growth and community building. While dialogue and understanding are important, the response does not adequately address the Christian understanding of tests as a means for believers to deepen their relationship with God. Further integration of Christian teachings and values would have significantly strengthened the response."
