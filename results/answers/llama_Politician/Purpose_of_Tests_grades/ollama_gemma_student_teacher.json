  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the complex nature of tests and challenges in a believer's life. The response acknowledges the diversity of perspectives and values among believers, while offering a compassionate and inclusive approach to the topic. The student's insights on resilience, spiritual growth, and personal transformation are well-articulated and supported by relevant examples. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian perspective on tests as revealed in scripture, specifically referencing verses or passages that support the idea that tests are intended to expose sin and draw believers closer to God."
