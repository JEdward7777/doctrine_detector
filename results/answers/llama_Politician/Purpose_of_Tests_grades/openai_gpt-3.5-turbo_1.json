However, the response did not explicitly emphasize the foundational Christian perspective that tests are allowed by God to reveal sin, prompt repentance, and deepen one's relationship with Him. While promoting inclusivity and respect for different beliefs is commendable, it is important to clearly anchor the discussion in the Christian worldview when addressing the nature and purpose of tests in a believer's life. Strengthening the Christian perspective and its implications on a believer's response to difficult circumstances would enhance the response."
