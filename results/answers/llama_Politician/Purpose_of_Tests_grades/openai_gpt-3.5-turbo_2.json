However, the concern of how understanding the nature of tests can affect a believer's response to difficult circumstances is not directly addressed. The response could have emphasized more the importance of recognizing tests as opportunities for spiritual growth and drawing closer to God in times of adversity, which would have strengthened the alignment with a Christian perspective."
