The response's focus on inclusivity and diversity, while important in the political realm, somewhat dilutes the Christian worldview on the purpose of tests. Encouraging dialogue and understanding is good, but in a Christian context, the ultimate focus should be on aligning one's response to tests with God's purposes for spiritual growth and sanctification."
