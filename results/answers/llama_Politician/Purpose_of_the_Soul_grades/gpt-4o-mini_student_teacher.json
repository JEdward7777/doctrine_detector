  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful analysis of how the soul relates to a person's relationship with God as described in Scripture. They demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and incorporated relevant scriptural references to support their points. However, the student could have focused more on the specific ways in which the soul influences a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions, as the concern highlighted. Additionally, while it's commendable that the student acknowledged differing beliefs and experiences, a stronger emphasis on the Christian perspective and its implications for spiritual and moral aspects could have been beneficial. Overall, a well-written response deserving of a high grade."
