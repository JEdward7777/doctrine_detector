  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the relationship between the soul and a person's relationship with God as described in scripture. The response clearly explains the traditional Christian view of the soul as the non-physical part of a person that connects them to the divine. Additionally, the student provides relevant scriptural references to support their claims. \n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples or applications of how the soul relates to a person's spiritual life and moral decisions. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian perspective on the soul."
