However, it lacks doctrinal depth and clarity regarding the Christian perspective on the term \"rabbi.\" The response could have emphasized the distinction between Jewish and Christian religious leadership roles and the unique authority given to Jesus as the ultimate teacher and Messiah in Christianity. Additionally, the use of levity (\"not exactly kosher\") may come across as trivializing a serious theological discussion. More scriptural support and theological explanation would have strengthened the answer."
