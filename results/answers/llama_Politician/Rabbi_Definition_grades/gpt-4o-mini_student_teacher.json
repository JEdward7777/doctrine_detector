  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 60. The student provided some general information about the term \"rabbi\" in the context of Jewish leadership and teaching, which is good. However, the response failed to directly address the concern of understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. Additionally, while emphasizing respect and sensitivity towards different faith traditions is commendable, the answer lacked depth in relating specifically to Christian teaching regarding rabbinic influence in the New Testament. The student's response would benefit from more specific references to how rabbinic teaching intersects with Christian beliefs and the significance of this intersection in the New Testament."
