  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the term \"rabbi\" in its Jewish context, as well as an attempt to bridge the cultural and theological gap between Christianity and Judaism. The writer acknowledges the significance of Jewish traditions and leaders within their own faith community, which shows sensitivity to the concern about understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. For example, while the writer mentions Jesus as a Jewish teacher and leader, they don't explicitly explore how his rabbinic teachings relate to the Christian faith. Additionally, some of the phrases used (such as \"not exactly kosher\") may be seen as flippant or tone-deaf by some readers.\n\nOverall, though, this response shows a thoughtful and respectful approach to the topic, and it provides a good foundation for further exploration and understanding."
