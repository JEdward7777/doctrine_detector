It also emphasizes the importance of understanding and respecting Jewish traditions and leaders within their own faith community. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament and promoting harmony and mutual respect between Christians and Jews. A strong Christian worldview is evident in the emphasis on respecting others and seeking common ground."
