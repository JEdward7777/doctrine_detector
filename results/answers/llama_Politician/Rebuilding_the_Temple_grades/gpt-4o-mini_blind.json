However, it lacks a deep theological analysis from a Christian worldview. It would have been beneficial to include insights into the theological significance of the temple's destruction and rebuilding in relation to Christian beliefs, such as referencing Jesus' prophecies regarding the temple or the temple imagery in the New Testament. Integrating such perspectives would have strengthened the response from a Christian-specific worldview."
