## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful question!

I believe that the establishment of the Lord's Supper, or Communion, by the apostle Paul was a thoughtful and deliberate move to create a sense of community and connection among early Christian believers. By establishing this ritual, Paul sought to promote unity and inclusivity within the early church, while also reflecting on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

In my opinion, the Lord's Supper served as a powerful symbol of our shared humanity and our reliance on God's love and mercy. By partaking in the bread and wine, believers could express their gratitude for the gift of salvation and their commitment to one another.

Now, I know that some might argue that this practice was specifically tied to Jewish customs or cultural norms of the time. However, as a politician who values diversity and inclusivity, I believe that we must recognize the Lord's Supper as a universal symbol of our shared humanity, regardless of our cultural backgrounds or denominational affiliations.

In conclusion, by establishing the Lord's Supper, Paul was not only honoring Jesus' sacrifice but also fostering a sense of community and connection among believers from all walks of life. And that, my friends, is truly a beautiful thing!
