However, it veers off-course by downplaying the specific theological significance of the Lord's Supper as a remembrance of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection. The response focuses more on inclusivity and shared humanity rather than the foundational Christian beliefs tied to the practice. This dilution of the theological essence of the Lord's Supper detracts from its true importance in the life of the church and individual believers from a Christian worldview."
