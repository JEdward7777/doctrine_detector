However, the additional perspectives on diversity and inclusivity, while valuable, slightly detract from the focus on the core remembrance and proclamation of Christ's death and resurrection. Strengthening the connection to the foundational Christian belief in the Lord's Supper as instituted by the apostle Paul could enhance the overall Christian worldview perspective in the response."
