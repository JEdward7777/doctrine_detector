However, there is an emphasis on diversity and inclusivity that slightly detracts from the specificity of the Christian understanding of the Lord's Supper. A stronger focus on the theological significance of the Lord's Supper in relation to Jesus' death and resurrection would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
