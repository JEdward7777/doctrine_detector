The emphasis on interfaith understanding and dialogue is commendable. However, the response lacks a solid recognition of the Christian perspective that the rejection of Jesus by the Jewish religious leaders relates to questions of authority, faith, and the recognition of the Messiah. The focus on shared values and commonalities between faiths somewhat detracts from the specific Christian worldview concerning this issue."
