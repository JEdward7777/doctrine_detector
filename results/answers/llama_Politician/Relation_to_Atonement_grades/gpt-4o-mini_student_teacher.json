  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the terms \"propitiation\" and \"atonement,\" showing an understanding of their significance in religious contexts. However, the response lacked clarity in directly addressing the concern of clarifying the differences and similarities between the two terms. The student's answer was informative but did not directly compare and contrast propitiation and atonement as requested."
