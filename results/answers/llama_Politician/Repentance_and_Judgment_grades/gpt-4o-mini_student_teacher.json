  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student touched on the concepts of repentance and the wrath of God, their answer lacked a clear alignment with the Christian perspective provided in the reference answer. The response seemed to downplay the seriousness of God's wrath and did not emphasize repentance as the key to avoiding judgment and receiving mercy. There was also a lack of in-depth biblical references to support the claims made. The focus on positive aspects and inclusivity, while important, should not overshadow the biblical truth about the consequences of sin and the need for repentance."
