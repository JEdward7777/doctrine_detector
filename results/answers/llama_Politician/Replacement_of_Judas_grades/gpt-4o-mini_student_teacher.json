  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response, while well-intentioned in emphasizing sensitivity and inclusivity, unnecessarily veered off topic and did not directly address the question with the necessary biblical context. The student correctly identified Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas Iscariot but should have focused more on clarifying the biblical account for a better understanding of apostolic leadership continuity."
