While the response does acknowledge the importance of context and inclusivity, it fails to provide a clear and concise explanation of how Matthias' selection fits into the larger narrative of apostolic succession. The response also prioritizes being respectful and inclusive over providing straightforward information, which is not entirely relevant to the original concern."
