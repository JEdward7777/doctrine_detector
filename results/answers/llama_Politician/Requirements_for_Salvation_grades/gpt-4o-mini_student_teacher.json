  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the mark by not directly mentioning the crucial aspects of repentance and belief in Jesus Christ as the foundation for salvation according to the Bible. While the student's response touches on some relevant points, the key biblical teachings on salvation are not explicitly addressed with clarity. A stronger emphasis on biblical teachings and doctrines would have improved the grade for this response."
