## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I think it's essential to approach this topic with sensitivity and tact, considering the complexities of historical narratives and the potential for misunderstanding or offense.

Rather than placing direct blame on the crowd, I would suggest that we focus on the broader societal context and the historical circumstances surrounding Jesus' crucifixion. We could explore how the events unfolded through a lens of cultural, religious, and political dynamics of the time.

Perhaps we could frame our discussion around the concept of collective responsibility versus individual agency. By acknowledging the complexities of human decision-making and the role of social pressure in shaping actions, we can create a safe space for introspection and self-reflection.

Let's aim to craft a message that is both honest about the past while also promoting empathy, understanding, and reconciliation. By doing so, we can work towards building bridges between communities and fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect.
