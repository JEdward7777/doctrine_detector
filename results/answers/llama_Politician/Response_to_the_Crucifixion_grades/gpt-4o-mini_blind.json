However, it lacks doctrinal correctness in addressing Peter's specific message to the crowd. From a Christian worldview, it is important to acknowledge the biblical account where Peter directly accuses the crowd of crucifying Jesus and calls them to repentance (Acts 2:36-38). The response could have included a recognition of the biblical narrative and Peter's emphasis on individual accountability and repentance rather than diluting the message in a broader societal context."
