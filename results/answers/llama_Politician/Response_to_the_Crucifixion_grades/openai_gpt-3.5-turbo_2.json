It encourages self-reflection and introspection while promoting empathy and reconciliation, all of which are important aspects of responding to the gospel message. However, it could have more directly emphasized the importance of repentance and faith in responding to the gospel message as Peter did in the Bible passage provided. Strengthening this connection would have enhanced the alignment with a Christian worldview."
