While the response does address the importance of sensitivity and exploring historical context, it deviates from the central emphasis on repentance, faith, and the resurrection of Jesus as key components of responding to the gospel message. To align more closely with a Christian worldview, the response should seek to integrate these core theological aspects more prominently into the discussion of collective responsibility and societal dynamics."
