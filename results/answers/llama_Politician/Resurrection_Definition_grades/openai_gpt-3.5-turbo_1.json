It is important to emphasize the foundational Christian belief in the literal resurrection of Jesus for understanding the core teachings and beliefs of Christianity regarding life after death. The response could have maintained a stronger emphasis on the Christian perspective while still acknowledging diversity of beliefs in a respectful manner."
