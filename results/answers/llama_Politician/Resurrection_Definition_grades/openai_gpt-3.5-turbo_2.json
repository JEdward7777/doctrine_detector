The response emphasizes the symbolism and metaphorical aspects of resurrection without delving deeply into the core Christian belief in the literal resurrection of Jesus and its implications for the Christian faith. Encouraging respectful dialogue and inclusivity is commendable, but a more explicit connection to the central Christian doctrine of resurrection would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
