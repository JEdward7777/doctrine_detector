However, the response also includes a broader interpretation of resurrection as a metaphor for personal transformation and spiritual awakening, which may dilute the focus on the Christian perspective specifically. While it is important to respect diverse beliefs, emphasizing the core Christian understanding of resurrection would have strengthened the response further in addressing the concern effectively."
