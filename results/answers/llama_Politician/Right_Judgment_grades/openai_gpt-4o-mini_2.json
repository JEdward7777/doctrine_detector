  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does a commendable job of addressing the concern of promoting a spirit of grace rather than judgment within Christian communities. It emphasizes the importance of showing understanding, compassion, and forgiveness, which align with Christian principles of love and mercy. The candidate effectively connects the biblical passage to the need for a non-judgmental attitude and fostering inclusivity. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the importance of holding individuals accountable while still extending grace, as Christian teaching also advocates for upholding moral standards. Overall, a well-rounded and thoughtful response."
