However, it falls short in clearly affirming the foundational Christian doctrine that God's wrath is a just response to sin and disobedience, while His love and mercy are expressions of His character. The answer could be improved by emphasizing the importance of Christ's atoning sacrifice in reconciling God's justice and mercy, as well as by referencing key biblical passages that address the relationship between God's wrath and His love."
