  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful exploration of the topic and attempts to reconcile God's wrath with His loving and merciful nature from a nuanced perspective. The student acknowledges the complexities of the issue and provides different viewpoints to consider. However, the answer could have been more grounded in biblical teaching and emphasized the importance of God's justice and holiness in conjunction with His love and mercy. There is room for improvement in connecting the concept of God's wrath to the biblical narrative and the offer of salvation through repentance and belief in Him."
