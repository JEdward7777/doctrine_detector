  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and respectful overview of the roles of angels according to biblical references. They accurately mentioned key functions such as messengers, protectors, and agents of God's will. However, there was a slight deviation in emphasizing differing interpretations and perspectives, which, while important in some contexts, could have been more directly linked to the impact on Christians' perception of divine intervention. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic was demonstrated."
