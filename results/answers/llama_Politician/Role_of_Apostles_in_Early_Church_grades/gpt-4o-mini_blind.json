  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful analysis of the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers. They highlighted important aspects such as diversity, love, communication, and servant leadership. However, the response lacked scriptural references and failed to emphasize the centrality of Jesus Christ in forming and sustaining Christian community. Additionally, the focus on building bridges and inclusivity, while important, should have been framed within the context of biblical principles and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Overall, while the student showcased a good understanding, there is room for improvement in grounding the analysis more firmly in Christian doctrine and scripture."
