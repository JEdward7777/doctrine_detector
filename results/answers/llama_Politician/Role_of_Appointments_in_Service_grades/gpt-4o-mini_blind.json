However, the response lacks specificity in terms of the biblical basis for these roles and the importance of aligning them with God's will. It also focuses more on inclusivity and diversity rather than highlighting the biblical principles guiding the roles within the Church. More emphasis on the uniqueness of each believer's spiritual gifts and the importance of serving according to God's design would have strengthened the answer."
