  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer is well-written and inclusive, emphasizing the importance of diverse roles within the Church. However, the response lacks specificity in addressing the responsibility of believers in their appointed tasks within the body of Christ, which was the key concern. The reference answer provided a clear and concise statement on fulfilling roles within the Church, which the student's response did not directly address. The student could improve by focusing more on the specific actions and attitudes that Christians are called to exhibit in fulfilling their appointed roles within the Church."
