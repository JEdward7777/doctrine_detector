  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student's answer lacks a clear understanding of the significance of blood in the Passover event from a biblical perspective. The attempt to generalize the interpretation of blood sacrifices and to downplay the specific theological and ritual importance regarding the Passover event detracts from the doctrinal correctness required in answering this question. The response also lacks depth and fails to provide a coherent explanation rooted in Christian worldview principles. Further development and alignment with biblical teachings would greatly improve the grade."
