  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear understanding of the Christian perspective on sacrifice and atonement. They touch on some general themes of sacrifice and redemption but fail to connect it to the Christian faith. Additionally, their avoidance of specific theological or ritual significance undermines the depth and spiritual significance of the Passover event as understood in Christianity. The response lacks coherence and depth, missing the opportunity to explore the sacred and profound nature of sacrifice within the context of Christian theology."
