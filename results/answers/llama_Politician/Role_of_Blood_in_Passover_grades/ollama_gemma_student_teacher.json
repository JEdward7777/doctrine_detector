  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the symbolic significance of the blood in the Passover event from a Christian perspective. However, the response lacks precision and clarity in its explanation of the theological significance of the blood. The student's attempt to draw parallels between the Passover event and modern-day social issues is somewhat forced and does not significantly enhance the understanding of the biblical event."
