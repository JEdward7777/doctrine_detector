The response lacked a clear acknowledgment of Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrificial lamb whose blood provides atonement for sin. Additionally, the response minimized the theological significance of blood in Passover by avoiding specific religious implications and focusing more on general themes. There was also a lack of clarity and coherence in presenting a Christian worldview perspective on the topic."
