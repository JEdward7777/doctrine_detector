  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: The response lacks a clear understanding of the importance of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian faith. The student attempted to discuss the significance of blood in the Passover event but failed to connect it to the broader Christian understanding of sacrifice and atonement. Additionally, the response seemed hesitant and somewhat dismissive of the theological implications of blood symbolism in Passover. It is important to approach biblical topics with reverence and a desire to understand and respect the religious beliefs associated with them."
