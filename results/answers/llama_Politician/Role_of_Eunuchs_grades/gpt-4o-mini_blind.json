However, the answer falls short in addressing how the role of eunuchs in ancient times reflects God's plan for different individuals in society from a Christian worldview. It focuses more on inclusivity and empathy without delving into the theological aspect of God's sovereign plan. The response could be improved by connecting the historical role of eunuchs to biblical principles and discussing how God's overarching plan for individuals encompasses diverse gifts and callings within society."
