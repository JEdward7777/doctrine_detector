However, while it acknowledges the significance of Jesus as the Messiah, the response could further highlight the unique and central role of Jesus in God's plan for humanity as the Son of God who fulfills prophecies and rules over God's kingdom with righteousness forever. A stronger connection between Jesus' role and God's plan for humanity would enhance the depth of the analysis."
