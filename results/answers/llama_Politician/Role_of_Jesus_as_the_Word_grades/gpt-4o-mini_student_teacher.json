  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid explanation of the title 'the Word of God' ascribed to Jesus, emphasizing his divine nature and role in conveying God's message. However, the answer lacks a direct acknowledgment of Jesus' divinity or the significance of his role in revealing God, which is the main concern highlighted. Additionally, while the student addresses the concerns of inclusivity and respect towards other beliefs, more focus on the specific Christian understanding of Jesus as the embodiment of God's message would have strengthened the response."
