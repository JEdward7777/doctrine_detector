However, there are moments where the language seems cautious and overly inclusive, lacking a firm assertion of the unique role of Jesus Christ as the only way to salvation according to Christian belief. Encouraging more direct and confident language in affirming Jesus' exclusive role in salvation would strengthen the Christian worldview perspective presented."
