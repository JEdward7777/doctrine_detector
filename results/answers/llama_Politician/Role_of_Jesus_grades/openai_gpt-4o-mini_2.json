While the response does acknowledge differing perspectives and seeks to avoid controversy, it could have delved deeper into the significance of Jesus as the Savior and the unique aspect of His role in Christianity. However, overall, the response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' central role in salvation."
