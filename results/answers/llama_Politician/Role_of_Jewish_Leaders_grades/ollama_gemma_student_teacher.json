  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the historical and theological complexities surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus. The student avoids making simplistic generalizations or assigning collective guilt, while still acknowledging the role of the Jewish religious leaders in the events leading up to Jesus' death. The inclusion of a political perspective and emphasis on interfaith dialogue adds depth and nuance to the response."
