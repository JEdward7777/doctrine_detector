  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's response touches on the use of parables by Prophet Nathan in confronting King David, the answer is overly focused on sensitivity and inclusivity rather than the actual biblical narrative and the significance of the parable itself. The explanation lacks depth and does not clearly convey how the parable was used for correction and revelation. The student missed the opportunity to explore the spiritual implications and lessons inherent in the biblical account. A more direct and focused engagement with the biblical text and its Christian worldview implications would have improved the response significantly."
