  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 92.\n\nThis response demonstrates a thorough understanding of Prophet Nathan's use of parables in confronting King David, as described in 2 Samuel 12:1-14. The writer provides a clear and detailed explanation of the encounter, highlighting Nathan's wisdom and diplomacy in approaching the sensitive topic. The response also shows an appreciation for the cultural sensitivity and inclusivity required when discussing biblical narratives.\n\nThe only area where the response falls short is in its lack of explicit connection to the concern about understanding the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. While the response does discuss Nathan's use of parables, it could have more explicitly explored how this method of storytelling served as a means of correction and revelation for King David.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a strong understanding of Prophet Nathan's approach to correcting King David through the use of a parable. The writer's sensitivity to cultural differences and their ability to present the material in a clear and respectful manner are also notable strengths."
