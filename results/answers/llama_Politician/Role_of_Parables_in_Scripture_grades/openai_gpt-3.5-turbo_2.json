  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives, specifically in the context of Prophet Nathan confronting King David. The answer provided a clear explanation of how Nathan used a parable to reveal David's sin, leading to acknowledgment and repentance. The student also acknowledged the importance of sensitivity and respect in handling biblical topics, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the response could have included more direct references to Scripture and theological implications to strengthen the analysis further."
