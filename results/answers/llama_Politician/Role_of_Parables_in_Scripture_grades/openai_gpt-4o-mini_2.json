The response would have been stronger if it directly referenced biblical teachings on repentance, sin, and the role of prophets in guiding individuals back to God's path through conviction and repentance. Additionally, a more explicit connection to Christian theology and teachings on moral accountability and redemption could have strengthened the response."
