  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament according to the Bible. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and included relevant biblical references to support their points. However, the student's response could have been more focused on the specific responsibilities outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher, rather than delving into historical and cultural nuances. While inclusivity is important, the primary concern was understanding the biblical role of priests, which could have been addressed more directly."
