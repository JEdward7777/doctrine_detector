  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, covering various aspects such as intercession, rituals, guidance, and interpretation. The writer also shows an effort to acknowledge the historical context and cultural nuances that shaped the roles of priests.\n\nWhile the response is generally accurate, it could be improved by providing more specific biblical references for each point, especially when discussing the responsibilities of priests. Additionally, the transition from describing priestly responsibilities to highlighting the importance of inclusivity and diversity feels a bit abrupt and could be better integrated into the main discussion. Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the role of priests in the Old Testament and is deserving of an 85% grade."
