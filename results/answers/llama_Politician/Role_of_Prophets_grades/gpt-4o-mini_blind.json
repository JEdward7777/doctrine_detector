  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 85.\n\nThe student correctly identifies the primary role of a prophet as being a messenger for God, delivering His messages to His people. The answer also highlights the aspects of warning, guidance, comfort, and encouragement that prophets provided in the Bible, showing a good understanding of the prophetic role.\n\nHowever, the response could have been strengthened by including specific references to biblical prophets and examples of their actions to support the points made. Additionally, the closing remarks about respecting diverse interpretations, while well-intentioned, could potentially dilute the importance of holding to sound doctrine and the authority of Scripture in interpreting the role of a prophet. Ultimately, it is important to emphasize conveying the biblical perspective accurately while recognizing the broader perspectives within the faith."
