  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 70.\n\nWhile the student accurately touched on the main aspects of a prophet's role, such as serving as a messenger for God, delivering His messages, warning of judgment, and providing guidance and comfort, there was a lack of specificity in connecting these points directly to the student's understanding of the biblical role of prophets. The response could have been improved by highlighting scriptural references and emphasizing the centrality of calling the people to repentance.\n\nAdditionally, the closing statements about diverse interpretations and traditions, while appreciative, could be perceived as somewhat vague and may detract from providing a focused Christian perspective on the topic. Encouraging reverence for God's Word is commendable, but it's important to ground the answer more firmly in biblical context and teachings."
