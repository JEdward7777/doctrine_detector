  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical role of prophets, highlighting their role as messengers of God's word and warnings to humanity. The response also acknowledges the importance of faithfulness, courage, and humility in this role.\n\nThe main areas where the response falls short are:\n\n1. Lack of specificity: While the response mentions that prophets often warned people of impending judgment or disaster, it does not provide specific examples from Scripture.\n2. Limited scope: The response primarily focuses on the negative aspects of prophetic ministry (warning and judgment) without mentioning other important roles, such as guidance, comfort, and hope.\n\nOverall, this is a solid effort that demonstrates a good grasp of the biblical concept of prophets. With some additional depth and nuance, it could be even stronger.\n\nComment: This response shows promise, but could benefit from more specificity and attention to the broader scope of prophetic ministry."
