  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful response to the question, demonstrating a good understanding of the historical context of the Sadducees within the Jewish temple system. They accurately described the role and responsibilities of the Sadducees, highlighting their involvement in maintaining traditional practices and the temple's rituals. The student also acknowledged the complexity and diversity within Judaism during that time. However, there was some unnecessary repetition and a slight departure from the specific focus on the Sadducees' main responsibilities within the temple system. Overall, a strong effort with room for a bit more conciseness and directness in addressing the question directly."
