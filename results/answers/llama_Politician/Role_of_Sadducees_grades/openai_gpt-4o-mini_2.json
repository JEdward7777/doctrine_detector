It also contextualizes their responsibilities within the broader historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus by mentioning other Jewish groups like the Pharisees and the Essenes. The response could have further emphasized the religious significance and spiritual beliefs of the Sadducees from a Christian worldview perspective to enhance the understanding of their role in relation to Jesus and the early Christian movement."
