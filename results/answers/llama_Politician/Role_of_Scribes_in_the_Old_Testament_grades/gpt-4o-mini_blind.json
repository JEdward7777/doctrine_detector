However, it could have been improved by including more specific references to the religious significance of the Scriptures and the divine inspiration behind their preservation. Additionally, the focus on cultural and linguistic adaptation could be balanced with a stronger emphasis on the divine guidance and authority that guided the scribes in their work. Overall, a solid effort but with room for deeper theological reflection."
