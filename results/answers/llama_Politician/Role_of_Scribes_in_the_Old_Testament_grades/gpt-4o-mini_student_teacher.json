  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of the responsibilities of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures, including aspects such as copying, translating, maintaining accuracy, interpreting, and developing scriptural traditions. However, there is a significant amount of unnecessary preamble and emphasis on sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives, which detracts from focusing directly on the scribes' role in preserving the scriptures. While the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and provides valuable insights, the excessive introduction and lack of conciseness impact the overall clarity and precision of the response."
