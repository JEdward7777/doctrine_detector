  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and detailed explanation of the significance of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures, going beyond the initial answer to cover various aspects of their roles and contributions. The explanation is well-supported and reflects a deep understanding of the topic from a biblical perspective. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly tie the role of scribes to the broader context of biblical history and the divine providence in preserving Scripture."
