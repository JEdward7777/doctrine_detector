The student not only accurately identifies the primary responsibility of scribes but also provides additional depth by discussing the translation, interpretation, and development of scriptural traditions carried out by scribes. The response is well-structured, detailed, and showcases a clear understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
