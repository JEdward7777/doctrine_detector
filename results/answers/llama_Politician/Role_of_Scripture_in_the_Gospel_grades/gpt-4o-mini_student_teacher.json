However, the answer could be improved by focusing more directly on specific biblical examples, like the ones provided in the reference answer, to illustrate the integration of Scripture in the communication of the Gospel. Encouraging the student to anchor their insights in concrete biblical references would strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
