  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and well-structured overview of the role witnesses played in the New Testament regarding the life and resurrection of Jesus. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the perspectives offered by the four Gospel writers and the significance of eyewitness testimony in shaping Christian beliefs. However, the emphasis on inclusivity and respect for all faiths may dilute the distinct Christian perspective required for this question. To improve, the student could strengthen the Christian-specific worldview by emphasizing the unique divinity of Jesus Christ and the central role of faith in salvation as taught in Christian doctrine."
