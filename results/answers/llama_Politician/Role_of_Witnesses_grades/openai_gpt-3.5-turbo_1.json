  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the witnesses in the New Testament and their roles in testifying about Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. The inclusion of specific Gospel writers and their perspectives adds depth to the discussion. However, the response does not explicitly connect the importance of witnessing in the New Testament to the call for Christians to share personal experiences of God's work in their lives. More emphasis on the significance of personal testimony in evangelism from a Christian perspective would have strengthened the alignment with the provided concern."
