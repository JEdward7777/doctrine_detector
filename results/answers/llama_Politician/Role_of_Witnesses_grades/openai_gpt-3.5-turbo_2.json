However, the response falls short of emphasizing the call for Christians to actively witness their faith and share personal experiences of God's work in their lives, which is a crucial aspect of Christian faith. It would have been stronger if the importance of personal testimony and evangelism was highlighted more explicitly in relation to the witness accounts in the New Testament."
