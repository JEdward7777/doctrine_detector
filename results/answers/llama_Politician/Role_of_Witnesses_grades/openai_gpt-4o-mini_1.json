  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and well-structured discussion on the pivotal role witnesses played in the New Testament regarding Jesus' life and resurrection, drawing from the Gospels and other writings. However, the response lacks a direct emphasis on the call for Christians to personally witness their faith and share their experiences of God's work in their lives. While the content is commendable, it falls short of directly addressing the specified concern."
