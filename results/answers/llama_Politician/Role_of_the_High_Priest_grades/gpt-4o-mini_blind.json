  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written and thoughtful response regarding the unique responsibilities of the high priest compared to other priests in Israel. However, the answer lacks specificity in terms of referencing biblical sources or theological explanations. To improve, the student could have included Scripture references such as Leviticus 16 for the duties of the high priest on Yom Kippur or Numbers 27:21 for his role as an advisor. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the priestly role of Christ as the ultimate High Priest in Christian theology could have been beneficial for a deeper understanding."
