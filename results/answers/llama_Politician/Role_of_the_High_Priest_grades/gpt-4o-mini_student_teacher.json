However, the response could have been more focused on the specific uniqueness of the high priest compared to other priests, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the spiritual significance of the high priest's role in mediating between God and the people. Overall, a solid effort but could benefit from more precision and depth."
