  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The answer did not provide a clear, doctrinally sound explanation of how the Holy Spirit empowers a believer after they are born again. It lacked specificity and failed to emphasize the biblical teachings on the topic. While it promoted unity and inclusivity, it sacrificed doctrinal correctness and depth of explanation. This response would benefit from a more focused and scripturally based discussion on the empowering work of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life."
