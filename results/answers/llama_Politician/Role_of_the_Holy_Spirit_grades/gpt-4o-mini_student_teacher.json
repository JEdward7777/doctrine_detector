  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response briefly touches on the Holy Spirit's role in empowering believers, it lacks depth and clarity. The student's focus on promoting unity and inclusivity, while noble, detracts from providing a clear understanding of the Holy Spirit's empowering work in a believer's life. The student should have incorporated more specific biblical references and theological insights to strengthen their response within a Christian worldview."
