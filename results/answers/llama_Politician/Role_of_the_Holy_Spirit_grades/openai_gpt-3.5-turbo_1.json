However, the answer lacks in-depth theological reflection on the specific ways the Holy Spirit works in a believer's life to produce good spiritual fruit, which is crucial for spiritual growth and guidance in Christian living. While the response promotes unity and inclusivity, it could have provided clearer theological insights grounded in a Christian worldview."
