However, there is a lack of specificity in directly referencing the Holy Spirit's role in producing good spiritual fruit, which was the main focus of the given answer. Additionally, while promoting unity and inclusivity is commendable, it is important to also uphold the truth of Christian teachings when discussing theological matters. Encouraging dialogue and respecting diversity should not come at the expense of clarity on foundational beliefs."
