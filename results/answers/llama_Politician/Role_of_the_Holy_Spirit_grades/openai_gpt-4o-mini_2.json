While the answer provided in the beginning is somewhat addressed, the focus deviates towards emphasizing diversity of beliefs and promoting unity, which is commendable but dilutes the depth of the topic. The response could have delved more into the specific workings of the Holy Spirit in producing spiritual fruit and the transformative impact on a believer's life, aligning more closely with the concern provided."
