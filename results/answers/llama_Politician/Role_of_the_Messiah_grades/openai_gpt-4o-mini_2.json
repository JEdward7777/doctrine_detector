It aligns well with the given answer about the Messiah being a prophet, a priest, and a king, and starting the New Covenant. The response could have been strengthened by directly referencing the specific roles of prophet, priest, and king in the context of Jesus' mission and authority, providing a more direct link between the given answer and the concern raised. Overall, a thoughtful and insightful exploration from a Christian worldview perspective."
