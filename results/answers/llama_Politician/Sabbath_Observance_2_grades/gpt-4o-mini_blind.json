However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness in emphasizing the importance of different interpretations and diversity of beliefs. A more focused and doctrinally accurate explanation would have been more appropriate in addressing the question from a traditional Christian perspective. In a Christian-specific worldview, highlighting the true meaning and significance of God's instructions to the Israelites should take precedence over promoting inclusivity and tolerance towards differing interpretations."
