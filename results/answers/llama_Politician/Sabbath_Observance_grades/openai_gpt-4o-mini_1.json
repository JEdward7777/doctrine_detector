It could have delved deeper into explaining how keeping the Sabbath impacts daily living as a Christian, including the spiritual significance and the opportunity for reflection and communion with God. The response acknowledges the diversity of practices, but it could have highlighted the unique Christian perspective on the Sabbath more clearly."
