The mention of respect for all cultures and faiths is commendable, however, in a context where doctrinal correctness is prioritized, the focus on inclusivity and welcoming all faiths may dilute the emphasis on the specifically Jewish perspective on the Sabbath. It's important to uphold the doctrinal accuracy of the Jewish tradition when addressing questions related to it."
