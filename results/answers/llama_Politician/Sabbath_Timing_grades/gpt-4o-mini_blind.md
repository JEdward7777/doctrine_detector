## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm glad you asked that question, and I want to approach it with sensitivity and respect for all cultures and faiths.

According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath, also known as Shabbat or Yom HaShabbat, typically begins on Friday evening at sundown and ends on Saturday evening at sundown. This timing is based on the biblical commandment to observe the Sabbath from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday, which is outlined in Exodus 20:8-11.

However, I want to emphasize that people of all faiths and backgrounds should feel welcome and respected in our society, regardless of their religious observances or traditions.

Comment: The response provides a correct answer regarding the timing of the Sabbath according to Jewish tradition, citing the biblical basis as well. The mention of respect for all cultures and faiths is commendable, however, in a context where doctrinal correctness is prioritized, the focus on inclusivity and welcoming all faiths may dilute the emphasis on the specifically Jewish perspective on the Sabbath. It's important to uphold the doctrinal accuracy of the Jewish tradition when addressing questions related to it.
