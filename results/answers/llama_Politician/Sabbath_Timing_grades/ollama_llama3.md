## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm glad you asked that question, and I want to approach it with sensitivity and respect for all cultures and faiths.

According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath, also known as Shabbat or Yom HaShabbat, typically begins on Friday evening at sundown and ends on Saturday evening at sundown. This timing is based on the biblical commandment to observe the Sabbath from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday, which is outlined in Exodus 20:8-11.

However, I want to emphasize that people of all faiths and backgrounds should feel welcome and respected in our society, regardless of their religious observances or traditions.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response accurately answers the question about when the Sabbath begins and ends, citing the biblical commandment in Exodus 20:8-11 as the basis for its timing. This shows an effort to recognize the specific timeframe for the observance of the Sabbath in accordance with Biblical teaching, which is the primary concern.

However, I would deduct points because the response does not explicitly state that the Sabbath begins on Friday at sundown and lasts until Saturday at sundown, but rather mentions it as part of a broader statement about Jewish tradition. While this information is accurate, it does not directly answer the question in the same way as the provided example.

Overall, the response demonstrates an understanding of the biblical teaching regarding the Sabbath, but could be more explicit in its answer to the question.
