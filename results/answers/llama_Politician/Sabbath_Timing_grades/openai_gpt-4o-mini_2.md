## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I'm glad you asked that question, and I want to approach it with sensitivity and respect for all cultures and faiths.

According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath, also known as Shabbat or Yom HaShabbat, typically begins on Friday evening at sundown and ends on Saturday evening at sundown. This timing is based on the biblical commandment to observe the Sabbath from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday, which is outlined in Exodus 20:8-11.

However, I want to emphasize that people of all faiths and backgrounds should feel welcome and respected in our society, regardless of their religious observances or traditions.

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate statement about the timing of the Sabbath based on the biblical teaching, meeting the concern raised. The mention of sensitivity and respect for all cultures and faiths enhances the response and reflects a commendable attitude towards inclusivity. However, the connection to a Christian-specific worldview could have been strengthened by referencing the significance of the Sabbath in relation to Christian beliefs and practices.
