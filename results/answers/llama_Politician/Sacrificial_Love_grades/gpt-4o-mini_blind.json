However, it falls short in clarity and depth concerning the sacrificial nature of Jesus' love, the atonement, and the biblical basis for sacrificial love. It also lacks a definitive connection to the Christian worldview and diminishes the uniqueness of Christian teachings on sacrificial love. The response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the doctrinal aspects of sacrificial love as exemplified by Jesus."
