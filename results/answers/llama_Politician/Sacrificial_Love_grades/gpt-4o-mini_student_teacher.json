  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-intentioned and inclusive, veers away from the essence of God's love as demonstrated by Jesus. They do not directly address the sacrificial aspect of Jesus' love and focus more on a general sense of empathy and compassion. The student's response lacks depth in connecting the concept of sacrificial love to Jesus' ultimate sacrifice on the cross. A stronger emphasis on the core Christian principle of selfless love, demonstrated through Christ's sacrifice, would have been beneficial."
