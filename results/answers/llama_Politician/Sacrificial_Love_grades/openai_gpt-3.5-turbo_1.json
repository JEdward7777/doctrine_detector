However, there was a lack of direct connection to the essence of God's love and how it should reflect in personal relationships based on a Christian specific worldview. The response was well-articulated and inclusive of diverse beliefs, but could be strengthened by more explicitly tying the concept back to the sacrificial love exemplified by Jesus and the implications of that in personal relationships."
