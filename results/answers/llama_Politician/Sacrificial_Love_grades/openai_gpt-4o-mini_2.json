The focus on promoting understanding and unity, while valuable, somewhat diluted the depth of the Christian worldview in this context. Although the response attempted to approach the topic with sensitivity, it could have delved deeper into the theological significance of sacrificial love in personal relationships based on the essence of God's love."
