  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed and respectful comparison between the beliefs of the Sadducees and Christian teachings regarding resurrection. They accurately describe the Sadducees' disbelief in resurrection and contrast it with the Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus and the promise of resurrection for believers. However, the response is overly verbose and lacks precision in directly addressing the question. The student could have focused more on the specific beliefs and implications for faith, rather than veering into political language and general statements on inclusivity."
