  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the difference between Sadducean and Christian teachings on the resurrection. The student clearly articulates the Sadducees' disbelief in the resurrection and contrasts it with Christian belief in Jesus' resurrection and eternal life. The inclusion of relevant biblical passages and a focus on inclusivity and respect adds depth and nuance to the response."
