However, the response lacked focus on the specific concern of exploring the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. The student's answer would have been stronger if it had delved deeper into how Samson's adherence to the Nazirite vow reflected his personal commitment to God's divine purpose in his life."
