The answer incorporates relevant verses and emphasizes the ongoing nature of sanctification. However, there are areas for improvement. The response could benefit from more precise theological language and deeper exploration of specific doctrinal nuances related to sanctification. Additionally, the inclusion of more references to key New Testament passages on sanctification would further enrich the answer. Overall, a solid foundation is present but further depth and specificity would enhance the response."
