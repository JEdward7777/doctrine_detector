  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of the sanctification process according to the New Testament, they do not emphasize the central role of faith in the process. The reference answer from the teacher specifically highlights that sanctification is for those who believe in Jesus, indicating the importance of faith. The student's response focuses more on the actions and transformations involved in sanctification rather than faith being the foundation of the process. Additionally, the student's answer could benefit from more direct references to verses that highlight the relationship between faith and sanctification in the New Testament."
