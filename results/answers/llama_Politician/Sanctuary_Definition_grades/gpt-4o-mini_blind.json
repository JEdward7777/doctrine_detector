The response should have focused more on the scriptural definition of sanctuary as a holy place set apart for worship and God's presence, rather than emphasizing a broader, inclusive understanding that could dilute the biblical significance. There is room for improvement in grounding the answer in biblical truth and highlighting the central role of sanctuaries in biblical worship and theology."
