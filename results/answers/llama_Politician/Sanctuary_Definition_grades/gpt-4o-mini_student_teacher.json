  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated and respectful answer that demonstrates an understanding of the concept of sanctuary within the Biblical context. While the response delves into the broader implications of sanctuary in modern times and emphasizes inclusivity, it slightly strays from the specific Biblical definition provided by the teacher. Encouraging dialogue and respect for differing views is commendable, but the focus should have been on explicating the traditional understanding of sanctuary in the Bible."
