The response also effectively incorporates additional insights regarding the cultural and historical context of sanctuaries and their modern implications. The only minor area for improvement would be to emphasize the Christian perspective more explicitly, perhaps by referencing specific Bible verses or theological teachings related to sanctuaries."
