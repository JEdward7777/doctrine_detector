  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament. The referencing of specific biblical verses adds credibility to the explanation. However, the student could strengthen the answer by further emphasizing the holiness and purity required within the sanctuary, as well as the significance of sacrifices and atonement for sin in maintaining the relationship between God and His people. Additionally, the inclusivity statement at the beginning, while commendable, may undermine the doctrinal focus of the response. Encouraging the student to prioritize doctrinal accuracy and depth in their future answers will enhance the overall quality of their theological discussions."
