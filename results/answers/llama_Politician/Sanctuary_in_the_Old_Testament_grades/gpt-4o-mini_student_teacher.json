  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed and thoughtful explanation of how God described the sanctuary in the Old Testament, they focused more on the symbolic and emotional aspects of the sanctuary rather than specifically addressing its role as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people. The student did mention God's instruction to Moses to build a sanctuary where He could dwell among His people, but the emphasis on inclusivity and respect for all beliefs somewhat detracts from the specific concern of the question. The student's response could have been stronger if they had directly tied God's description of the sanctuary to its role as a dwelling place and source of safety for His people, as outlined in the reference answer."
