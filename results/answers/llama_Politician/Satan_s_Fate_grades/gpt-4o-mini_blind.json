  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response fails to address the question directly and lacks doctrinal correctness. It prioritizes promoting unity and understanding among diverse backgrounds over presenting a Christian perspective on the fate of Satan and his followers in hell. A stronger emphasis should have been placed on Biblical teachings and the theology surrounding this topic. The student's response lacks substantive content in relation to the question asked."
