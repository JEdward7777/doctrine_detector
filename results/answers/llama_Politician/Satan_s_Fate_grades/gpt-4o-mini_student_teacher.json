  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely misses the Christian-specific aspect of the concern. The student's emphasis on tolerance and unity is positive, but it does not address the Christian belief regarding the fate of Satan and his followers in hell. The student needs to connect their response to the Christian worldview and theological beliefs to receive a higher grade."
