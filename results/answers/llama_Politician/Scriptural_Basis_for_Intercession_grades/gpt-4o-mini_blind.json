  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: The response demonstrates an attempt to discuss biblical passages related to intercession, but it lacks doctrinal accuracy and depth in addressing the concept from a Christian worldview. The interpretation and application of the selected passages are somewhat vague and disconnected from the core teachings of interceding for others. Additionally, there is a lack of clear emphasis on the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate intercessor between God and humanity. In future responses, the student should focus on providing more precise explanations grounded in sound Christian doctrine."
