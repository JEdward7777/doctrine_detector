The incorporation of additional verses from Hebrews, Isaiah, and Jeremiah as suggested in the provided answer shows a commendable effort to further align with Scripture. The response effectively encourages believers to delve deeper into the Bible for guidance on prayer and intercession, which aligns well with the concern expressed. However, some verses mentioned could have been linked more directly to the concept of intercession. Overall, a solid and insightful response."
