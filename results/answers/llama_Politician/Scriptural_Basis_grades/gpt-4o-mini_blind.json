The inclusion of Romans 3:25-26 and Hebrews 2:17 was appropriate, but the explanation could have been more centered on the Christian understanding of propitiation as a core doctrine of atonement rather than diluting it with considerations for other faiths. The focus should have been on providing a solid foundation from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death in reconciling humanity with God according to Christian teachings."
