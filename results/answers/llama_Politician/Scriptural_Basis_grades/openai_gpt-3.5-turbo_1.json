  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively ties the theological concept of propitiation to biblical references, specifically mentioning key verses such as 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26. However, the response could have provided a more direct and cohesive explanation of how these verses relate to propitiation to deepen understanding further. Integrating a more explicit analysis of the verses in relation to the concept of propitiation would have strengthened the response."
