## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful question! As we explore this topic, I want to make sure that we approach it with sensitivity and respect for all faiths and perspectives.

Regarding your inquiry about biblical passages addressing the concept of the "world" in relation to believers, let me provide some enlightening examples. In John 3:16-17, Jesus says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Here, Jesus is speaking about his love for all people, regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs.

In 1 John 5:19, we read, "We know that we are children of God, which gives us confidence and will keep on doing what is right." This passage emphasizes the connection between believers and the divine. It encourages us to live in accordance with our faith and to prioritize doing good works.

The book of James also sheds light on this concept. In James 1:27, it says, "Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world." Here, we see that believers are encouraged to engage with the world around them while still maintaining a commitment to their faith.

These passages demonstrate how the concept of the "world" relates to believers. I hope this answer has been helpful in addressing your question!

Comment: The student's answer provides relevant biblical passages that address the concept of the "world" in relation to believers. However, the response lacks depth and does not directly address the concern of navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the practical applications of these passages in navigating challenges posed by ungodly values would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
