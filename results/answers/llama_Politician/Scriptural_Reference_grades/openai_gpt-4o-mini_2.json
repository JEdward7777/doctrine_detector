The inclusion of relevant scripture references and explanations highlights the importance of maintaining faith while engaging with the world. The response effectively addresses the concern with a Christian worldview perspective. However, a more in-depth analysis of how believers can practically apply these passages in navigating everyday challenges in a secular world could further enhance the response."
