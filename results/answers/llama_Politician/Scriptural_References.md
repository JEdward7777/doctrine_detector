I'm happy to help you with that! *clears throat* According to my understanding, the reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham can be found in... *pauses to choose words carefully* ...the book of Genesis. Specifically, it's in chapter 17, where we read about the covenant between God and Abraham. *smiles warmly*

May I just take a moment to acknowledge that this is a significant passage in the biblical narrative, and one that has had a profound impact on people's understanding of their relationship with God across cultures and traditions? *pauses for a respectful beat*

Now, if you'll permit me, I'd like to add that this passage also speaks to the importance of faithfulness, trust, and commitment in our relationships â€“ whether it be between individuals, communities, or even nations. *nods thoughtfully*

May we all strive to embody these values as we navigate the complexities of our world today! *offers a warm smile*
