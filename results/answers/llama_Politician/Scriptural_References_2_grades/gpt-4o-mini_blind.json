  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and respectful answer that acknowledges the diversity of interpretations surrounding the concept of the day of judgment in Christian theology. The response highlights relevant biblical passages and encourages open dialogue and understanding. However, the answer falls short of doctrinal correctness by not clearly emphasizing the foundational Christian belief in the literal and imminent day of judgment as described in the Bible. The focus on inclusivity and diversity, while important in some contexts, should not overshadow the foundational doctrinal truths of the faith."
