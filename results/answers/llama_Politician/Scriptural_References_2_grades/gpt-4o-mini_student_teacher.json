  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: While the student provided a thoughtful and respectful response to the question about biblical passages supporting the concept of the day of judgment, the answer lacked direct references to specific passages as requested. The student did engage in a meaningful discussion about interpretation and diverse perspectives, which is commendable. However, a stronger answer would have included specific references like the ones provided in the teacher's reference answer."
