  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the biblical passages related to the day of judgment. They acknowledge the diversity of interpretations and perspectives within Christianity and promote respectful dialogue. Their inclusion of passages from both Matthew and Revelation is appropriate, and they provide a brief explanation of their significance. However, the response would be more comprehensive if the student had included additional specific references from the suggested key passages provided by the teacher."
