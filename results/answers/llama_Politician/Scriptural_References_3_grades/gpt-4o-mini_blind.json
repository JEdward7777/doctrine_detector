The focus should have been on the hypocrisy and inward corruption portrayed by Jesus in those verses. The response would have benefited from a deeper exploration of the Biblical text and theological implications rather than a generalized call to social justice. There is room for improvement in grounding the discussion more firmly in Christian doctrinal teachings on sin and repentance."
