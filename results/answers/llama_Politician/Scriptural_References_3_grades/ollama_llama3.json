  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThe LLM response effectively uses the biblical passage from Matthew 23:27-28 to discuss iniquity, highlighting both individual and systemic injustices. It also emphasizes the importance of creating a more just society and working towards dismantling structures that perpetuate harm and inequality. The language is clear and concise, making it easy for readers to follow along.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because while the response touches on some key themes related to genuine holiness, such as sensitivity, respect, and an open heart, it does not explicitly focus on pursuing internal righteousness versus external compliance. While the passage from Matthew 23:25 is referenced, it is not used as a primary example of this concept.\n\nOverall, I would say that the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical passage but could be improved by more directly addressing the concern about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards."
