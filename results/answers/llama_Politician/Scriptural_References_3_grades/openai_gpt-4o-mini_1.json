  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the given Bible passage and effectively connects it to the concern raised regarding the pursuit of genuine holiness over external compliance. The candidate effectively incorporates Christian values of empathy, compassion, and inclusivity in addressing systemic injustice, aligning with a Christian worldview. The response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the need for personal introspection and repentance in light of the passage, but overall, it effectively conveys a Christian perspective on iniquity and leadership."
