  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the significance of birthright in Biblical teachings by referencing key passages. The student effectively explains the cultural context and spiritual implications associated with the concept of birthright. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the overarching theme of divine election and God's sovereignty in determining inheritance. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the doctrinal implications of Hebrews 12:14-17 in relation to birthright and the Christian faith. Overall, a solid response with room for more precise theological exploration."
