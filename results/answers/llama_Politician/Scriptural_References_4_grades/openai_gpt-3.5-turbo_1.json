  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive exploration of the references to birthright in the Bible, tying them back to the value of birthright in God's plan, holiness, and consequences of neglecting one's spiritual inheritance. The analysis is well-supported by scriptural references and demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. The content is presented with sensitivity and nuance, respecting different perspectives. However, the response could have further connected the interpretation of birthright to contemporary Christian life by providing practical application or relevance for believers today."
