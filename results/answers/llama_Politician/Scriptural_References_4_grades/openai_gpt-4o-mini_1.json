The connection to holiness and the consequences of neglecting one's spiritual heritage is well-explained. However, the response could have further integrated the theme of scripture interpretation and its application to contemporary Christian life for a more comprehensive analysis. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Biblical concept of birthright within a Christian worldview."
