However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the specific verses that directly address the shift in understanding, such as Luke 16:23 as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, while the student emphasizes respect for all beliefs, they could have delved deeper into the implications for Christian eschatology based on the scriptural evidence presented. Overall, a solid effort but could benefit from more specificity and depth in addressing the concern."
