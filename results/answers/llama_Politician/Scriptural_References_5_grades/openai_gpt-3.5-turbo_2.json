  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-informed and respectful exploration of scriptural evidence regarding the nature of Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology. The student effectively references specific Biblical passages such as Luke 16:19-31 and 1 Peter 3:18-20 to support their points. The inclusion of appropriate verses and thoughtful analysis demonstrates a solid understanding of Christian beliefs on the topic. The response could be further enhanced by deepening the theological analysis and providing additional scriptural references to support the argument."
