  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student effectively elaborated on how 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11 illustrate the concept of exaltation through Jesus' example of humility and ultimate glorification. However, the excessive focus on addressing potential interpretations from diverse perspectives slightly detracted from directly addressing the concern. The student could have provided a more concise and focused response directly addressing the connection between humility and exaltation in the life of believers, as highlighted in the reference answer."
