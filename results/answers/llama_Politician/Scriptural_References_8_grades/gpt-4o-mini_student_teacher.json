  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and reflective response on the concept of being blameless, incorporating relevant biblical passages and personal insights. However, the student focused more on general themes of striving for excellence and grace, rather than directly addressing the specified concern of how scripture can guide a Christian's life in maintaining blamelessness. Encouraging the student to directly connect the scriptural references to practical guidance for living a blameless life would strengthen their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
