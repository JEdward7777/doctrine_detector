  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out response with appropriate Bible verses highlighting the theme of restoration. They emphasized God's desire to revitalize, forgive, and reconcile His people, showcasing a foundational aspect of the Christian faith. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by including additional specific verses like Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6 that directly emphasize God's promise of restoration and renewal. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of restoration in the Christian faith."
