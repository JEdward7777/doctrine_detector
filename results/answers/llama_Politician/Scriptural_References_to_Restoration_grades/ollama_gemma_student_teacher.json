  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer is well-written and thoughtfully explores the theme of restoration in the Bible. They provide several relevant verses and explain their significance in a clear and concise manner. The inclusion of insights from different parts of the Bible demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the topic. However, the student could have elaborated more on the connection between restoration and personal faith journeys, which would have strengthened their response from a Christian specific worldview."
