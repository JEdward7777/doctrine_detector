## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
Let's approach this question with sensitivity, nuance, and an open mind.

Jesus' words about the "Son of Man" returning on the clouds can be interpreted in various ways. As a thoughtful leader, I believe it's essential to consider different perspectives and avoid perpetuating any harmful or divisive rhetoric.

One possible interpretation is that Jesus was referring to his own return in judgment, as described in various biblical passages. This concept has been debated among scholars and theologians for centuries. Some may see this as a call to repentance, urging people to prepare for the Second Coming by living according to God's will.

However, I also recognize that not all people of faith may share this interpretation. We must respect the diversity of beliefs within Christianity and acknowledge that different denominations and traditions have varying perspectives on this topic.

As we explore Jesus' statement, it's crucial to avoid any language or tone that might marginalize or exclude certain groups. Rather than focusing solely on individual salvation, we should strive for a more inclusive understanding that considers the broader implications of faith for our global community.

Ultimately, I believe Jesus' words about the "Son of Man" coming back on the clouds can serve as a reminder to cultivate compassion, empathy, and kindness in our daily lives. By doing so, we can foster a sense of shared humanity and work towards creating a more just and equitable world for all.

Now, let's keep the conversation going and explore other perspectives without fear of offending or dividing others!
