The response fails to firmly establish the Christian understanding of Jesus' statement about the \"Son of Man\" returning on the clouds, and instead, it emphasizes tolerance to the point of compromising foundational Christian beliefs. It is important to uphold biblical truth and the core tenets of Christianity when discussing theological matters related to Jesus' teachings. Encouraging open dialogue is commendable, but it should not come at the expense of scriptural accuracy and theological integrity."
