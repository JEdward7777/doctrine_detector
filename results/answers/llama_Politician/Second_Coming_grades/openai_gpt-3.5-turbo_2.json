The focus on inclusivity and diversity, while important, slightly dilutes the significance of the specific Christian understanding of eschatology. Encouraging exploration of different perspectives is valuable, but it should be accompanied by a robust affirmation of core Christian beliefs to adequately address the concern raised."
