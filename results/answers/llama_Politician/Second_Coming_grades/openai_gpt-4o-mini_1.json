  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The response provides a thoughtful and open-minded exploration of differing interpretations of Jesus' return as the \"Son of Man\" in a Christian context. The candidate demonstrates a respectful approach to diverse beliefs within Christianity and emphasizes the importance of inclusive language and understanding. While the response covers various perspectives on the topic, it could have delved deeper into the specific implications of Jesus' second coming as the 'Son of Man' for Christian hope and eschatology, as outlined in the concern provided. More explicit connections to Christian doctrine and the implications of this belief for individuals' faith and eschatological expectations could have strengthened the response."
