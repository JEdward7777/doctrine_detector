  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and thoughtful response that effectively addressed the dangers of exalting oneself according to biblical teachings. They integrated relevant scripture references and emphasized the importance of humility and service to others. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the foundational sin of pride and its consequences, in line with Christian doctrine. Additionally, while the student's points were well-articulated, a deeper exploration of the eternal significance of humility and selflessness in the Christian faith could have been beneficial."
