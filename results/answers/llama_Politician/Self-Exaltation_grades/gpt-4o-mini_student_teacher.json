  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively addresses the concern of recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride by emphasizing humility and service to others, in accordance with Biblical teachings. The student's use of Biblical references and the focus on the potential dangers of exalting oneself align well with the teacher's reference answer. The response is well-reasoned, articulate, and demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview on this topic."
