The writer effectively uses biblical references and teachings to emphasize the importance of humility and service over self-exaltation. The connection between exalting oneself, pride, and separation from God is clearly articulated and supported with relevant scriptures. The response not only addresses the concern raised but also provides insightful reflections on how to combat pride and foster a more compassionate community based on Christian values."
