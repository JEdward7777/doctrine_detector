  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 75.\n\nThe student's response effectively explains the Pharisees' concern about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles in terms of maintaining the integrity of their faith and cultural heritage. The student correctly highlights the Pharisees' commitment to preserving the distinction between the chosen people of Israel and those outside the covenant. However, the answer loses some points for veering off-topic towards the end by discussing inclusivity and diversity, which were not directly related to the given concern. Additionally, the student's mention of being a politician may be seen as an unnecessary addition that detracts from the focus on the Pharisees' perspective. \n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the Pharisees' motives but could benefit from more precise alignment with the given concern."
