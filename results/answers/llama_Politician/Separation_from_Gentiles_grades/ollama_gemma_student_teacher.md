## [Answer](../Separation_from_Gentiles.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
The Pharisees, being devout Jews, were deeply committed to maintaining the purity of their faith and traditions. They believed that the Jewish people had a unique covenant with God, as reflected in the Torah and other sacred texts.

In this context, the Pharisees were concerned about "separating" the Jewish people from the Gentiles (non-Jews) because they sought to preserve the distinction between the chosen people of Israel and those outside the covenant. This was not about being exclusive or rejecting others; rather, it was a matter of maintaining the integrity of their faith and cultural heritage.

By setting apart certain practices, customs, and rituals as uniquely Jewish, the Pharisees were attempting to safeguard the Jewish way of life from external influences that might dilute its purity. In a sense, they were striving to create a "boundary" or "fence" around their traditions to protect them from corruption.

Of course, we must acknowledge that this concern for separation can be seen as problematic when viewed through the lens of modern times. Many would argue that such distinctions can lead to exclusivity and even discrimination against others. As a politician, I recognize the importance of balancing these concerns with the need for inclusivity and respect for diversity.

Let us strive to find common ground by recognizing the value of cultural heritage while also embracing the beauty of diversity and the interconnectedness of human experience.
