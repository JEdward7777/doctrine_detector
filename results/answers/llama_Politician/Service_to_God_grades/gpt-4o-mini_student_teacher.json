  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and inclusive response, incorporating biblical references and emphasizing the importance of serving others with humility and compassion. However, there was a lack of specificity in outlining actionable ways to engage in ministry, which was the key concern raised. Providing more concrete examples and practical steps for Christians to take in serving God would have strengthened the answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of ministry in a Christian worldview."
