  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student's response lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to provide a clear explanation rooted in Christian theology. While the answer attempts to be inclusive and respectful of all beliefs, it falls short in accurately representing the biblical significance of the rainbow as a sign of God's covenant with humanity in Genesis. The response should focus more on the biblical narrative and theological implications rather than attempting to find commonalities with other beliefs."
