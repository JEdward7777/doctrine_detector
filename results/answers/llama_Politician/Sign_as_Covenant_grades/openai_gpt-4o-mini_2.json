However, the inclusion of various beliefs and attempting to find common ground with all perspectives dilutes the specifically Christian understanding of God's covenant and promises in the Bible. While it is important to be respectful of other beliefs, the response could have more strongly emphasized the Christian perspective without attempting to blur distinctions between different faith traditions."
