The significance of the sign given to the shepherds goes beyond just a message of inclusivity; it is a fulfillment of prophecy, signifying the birth of the Savior, Christ the Lord. The focus should have been more on the miraculous nature of the sign and its connection to the Messianic prophecies in the Old Testament. The emphasis on radical inclusivity is commendable, but it should have been framed within the context of God's redemptive plan for humanity through the birth of Jesus. The response would benefit from a stronger foundation in biblical theology and a clearer articulation of the central message of Jesus' birth."
