  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful response, highlighting the inclusive nature of God's message through the sign given to the shepherds. However, the focus was more on the broader themes of inclusivity and openness rather than specifically addressing the significance of the sign in relation to the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs. While the student's perspective on inclusivity is valid, a more direct connection to the specific significance of the sign in relation to the Messiah's arrival would have strengthened the answer."
