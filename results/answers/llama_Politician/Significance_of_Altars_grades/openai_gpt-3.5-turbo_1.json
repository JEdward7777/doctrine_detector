However, the lack of direct alignment with the given answer and concern, as well as the generalizing language used in discussing various religious practices, detracted from a Christian specific worldview. Additionally, while the response emphasized sensitivity and respect towards different cultures and faiths, it did not explicitly tie the significance of altars to the Christian concept of sacrifice and devotion. Further incorporation of Christian perspectives and beliefs would have strengthened the overall connection to the concern provided."
