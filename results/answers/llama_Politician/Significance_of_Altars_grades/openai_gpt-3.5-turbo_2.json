It emphasizes the importance of approaching the topic with respect and sensitivity, which is commendable. However, the response could have more explicitly highlighted the parallels between ancient Israelite worship and Christian beliefs to further reinforce the importance of altars as a symbolic representation of sacrifice and devotion in the Christian faith."
