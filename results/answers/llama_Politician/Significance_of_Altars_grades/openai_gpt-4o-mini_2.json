The focus on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity, while important, detracts from a Christian-specific perspective on the concept of altars and its relation to sacrifice and devotion in biblical worship. More emphasis on the biblical understanding of sacrifice and devotion within Christianity would have strengthened the response."
