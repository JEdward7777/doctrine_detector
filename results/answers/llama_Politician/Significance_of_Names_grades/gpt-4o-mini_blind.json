The significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations is primarily rooted in the theological implications within the context of the Judeo-Christian faith tradition. The student should have delved deeper into the biblical and theological reasons behind the translation choice, emphasizing how it reflects the attributes and character of God as depicted in Scriptures. Additionally, there is a need for more explicit references to scripture and doctrinal teachings to strengthen the argument presented. The focus on inclusivity and compassion, while positive, should be grounded in sound biblical principles to align with a Christian worldview."
