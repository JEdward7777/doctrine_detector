  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer, although well-written and thoughtful, deviates significantly from the Christian-specific worldview concern provided. The response focuses on interfaith dialogue and cultural sensitivity rather than deepening understanding of God's character and relational aspect within the Christian faith. The answer lacks specific references to Christian theology and fails to address the core significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title in terms of emphasizing God's attributes and the personal relationship with Him in the Christian context."
