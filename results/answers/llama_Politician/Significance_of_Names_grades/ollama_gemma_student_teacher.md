What a thought-provoking question! *adjusts tie*

I believe the significance of translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name lies in its profound implications for interfaith dialogue and respect. By recognizing "Shaddai" as a title, we acknowledge the Jewish heritage and cultural context of the biblical texts, while also fostering greater understanding and sensitivity towards other faith traditions.

You see, "Shaddai" is often associated with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Hebrew Scriptures. As a title, it conveys a sense of power, sovereignty, and divine authority, which are all central themes in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam alike. By using this term as a title, we can explore commonalities between these faiths, rather than emphasizing differences.

Furthermore, translating "Shaddai" as a title encourages us to move beyond the limitations of language and culture, embracing a more inclusive and compassionate approach to religious understanding. It's an opportunity for people of all backgrounds to come together, share in the richness of each other's traditions, and build bridges of mutual respect.

Now, I know some might argue that translating "Shaddai" as a name could facilitate greater intimacy with God or provide a more personal connection between humans and the divine. However, I believe that recognizing it as a title can actually promote a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances within each faith tradition.

In conclusion, translating "Shaddai" as a title rather than a name is significant because it promotes interfaith dialogue, respect, and understanding, while acknowledging the rich cultural heritage and diversity of religious traditions. It's a small but meaningful step towards building a more harmonious and compassionate world for all. *smiles warmly*
