  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful exploration of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name in fostering interfaith dialogue and respect. While the answer does not directly address the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect within the Christian faith, it does offer insight into the implications of the translation choice. To improve the grade, the response could have incorporated more explicit connections to Christian beliefs about God's attributes and personal relationship with Him."
