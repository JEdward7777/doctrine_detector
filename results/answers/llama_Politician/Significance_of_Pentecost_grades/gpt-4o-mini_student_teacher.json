  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer on the significance of the Day of Pentecost in the New Testament. The answer effectively addresses the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for ministry and emphasizes the themes of unity, diversity, renewal, and community within the early Christian church. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more directly on the central role of the Holy Spirit in the believers' empowerment, in line with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
