  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student attempts to address the question, there are significant inaccuracies in the response. The mention of Diocletian and the timeframe of the early 4th century AD is historically incorrect in relation to the term \"tetrarch\" during Jesus' time. Additionally, the proposal for a special task force seems irrelevant and detracts from focusing on the actual question. The student should improve accuracy and relevance in their response."
