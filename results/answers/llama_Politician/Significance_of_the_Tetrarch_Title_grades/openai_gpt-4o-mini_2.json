However, the response primarily focuses on the proposal for further exploration of the topic rather than directly addressing the concern about how this understanding helps believers grasp the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry. While the proposed task force may lead to valuable insights, the response could have been more focused on explaining how the concept of tetrarchs relates to political tensions in Jesus' time from a Christian perspective."
