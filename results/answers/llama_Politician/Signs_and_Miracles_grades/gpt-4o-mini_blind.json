  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the student's response demonstrates a level of eloquence and diplomacy in discussing the topic of signs and miracles, it falls short in presenting a clear and doctrinally sound viewpoint from a Christian perspective. The answer lacks a firm stance on the significance and purpose of signs and miracles in confirming the truth of God's message as portrayed in the acts of Jesus and the apostles. Additionally, it places a heavy emphasis on personal interpretation and relativism rather than grounding the discussion in biblical teachings. Overall, the response could benefit from a stronger assertion of the central role of signs and miracles as evidences of God's power and divine message, in line with Christian doctrine."
