  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student touched on the importance of signs and miracles in sparking spiritual exploration and introspection, they failed to clearly state that signs and miracles serve as validations of God's power and authority, as seen in the acts of Jesus and the apostles. Additionally, the response lacked a strong emphasis on the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation from a Christian worldview. The student did, however, demonstrate a respectful and inclusive approach to discussing the topic, which is commendable. Moving forward, the student could benefit from delving deeper into the specifically Christian perspective on the significance of signs and miracles in confirming the truth of God's message."
