While the speaker acknowledges that these phenomena can serve as \"remarkable\" events and reminders of the mysteries of the universe, they do not explicitly connect them to the validation of God's message.\n\nThe response also highlights the importance of approaching this topic with sensitivity, respect, and an open heart and mind, which is crucial in examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. However, it does not fully engage with the idea that signs and miracles serve as evidence of God's power and authority.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a thoughtful and nuanced exploration of the topic, it could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting the signs and miracles to the validation of God's message and His power and authority."
