  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response overall acknowledges the significance of signs and miracles as validating God's power and authority, aligning well with a Christian worldview. The candidate effectively discusses the impact of signs and miracles on faith and spiritual exploration, demonstrating a good understanding of the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. However, the response could have emphasized more on the concrete role of signs and miracles in directly revealing God's message, rather than leaving it as a matter of personal interpretation. Nevertheless, the candidate's respectful and compassionate approach aligns well with Christian values."
