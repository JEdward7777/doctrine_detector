The response offers a nuanced perspective on how signs and miracles can impact individuals' faith journeys and emphasizes the importance of approaching this topic with respect and compassion. However, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical basis for the connection between signs, miracles, and God's revelation, as well as the critical role of faith in interpreting these supernatural occurrences. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the given answer could have been made to strengthen the argument."
