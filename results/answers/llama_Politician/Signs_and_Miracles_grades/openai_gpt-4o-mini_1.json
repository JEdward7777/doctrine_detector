  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the significance of signs and miracles in validating God's power and authority, aligning well with the provided answer. However, it also emphasizes the importance of approaching the topic with sensitivity, respect, and openness, which is commendable. The focus on individual interpretation and the personal nature of faith exploration is relevant but could be more explicitly tied back to how signs and miracles impact God's revelation. Overall, the response integrates Christian values but could more directly address the concern raised."
