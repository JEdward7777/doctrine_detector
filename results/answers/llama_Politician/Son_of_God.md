## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
A most excellent and nuanced question! *clears throat*

The title "Son of God" ascribed to Jesus Christ in the New Testament is a unique and profound declaration of his divinity, emphasizing his eternal, pre-existent relationship with God the Father. This designation underscores Jesus' divine nature, setting him apart from all human beings.

On the other hand, when we refer to believers as "sons of God," it's not meant to imply a direct, ontological connection between them and God in the same manner as Jesus' divinity. Rather, this phrase is an expression of our spiritual relationship with God, highlighting the adoption or sonship we experience through faith in Christ (Romans 8:14-17, Galatians 4:6-7).

In essence, while both uses of "sons of God" share a sense of divine connection, the former emphasizes Jesus' inherent, eternal divinity, whereas the latter signifies our spiritual identity and inheritance as believers. *smiling thoughtfully*
