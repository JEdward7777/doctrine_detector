However, it falls short in addressing the concern of understanding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God with clarity and emphasis. While the response promotes interfaith dialogue and inclusivity, it could have more directly reaffirmed the Christian belief in Jesus as fully God and the significance of His eternal relationship with God in a stronger manner."
