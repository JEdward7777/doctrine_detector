  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: While the answer demonstrates an awareness of varying interpretations surrounding the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, it falls short in providing a definitive Christian perspective grounded in biblical doctrine. The focus on political correctness and inclusivity detracts from the importance of accurate theological interpretation. The answer lacks a strong foundation in Christian theology and fails to prioritize doctrinal correctness when addressing a biblical topic. Moving forward, the student should strive to incorporate a more biblically-based approach in their analysis."
