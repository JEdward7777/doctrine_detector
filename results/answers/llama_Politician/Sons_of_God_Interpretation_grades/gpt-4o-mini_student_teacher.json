  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive overview of different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, they failed to provide a clear stance or conclusion based on a Christian-specific worldview. The response lacked a strong biblical foundation and did not effectively integrate a Christian understanding of the term. Further theological analysis and a clear alignment with biblical doctrines would greatly enhance the quality of the response."
