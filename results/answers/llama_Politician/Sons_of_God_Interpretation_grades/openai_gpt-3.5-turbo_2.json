The concern raised highlighted the importance of understanding biblical interpretation for grasping the meaning of scripture passages, which the response did not fully address from a distinctly Christian worldview. Encouraging respectful dialogue and inclusivity is commendable, but a stronger emphasis on the foundational principles of biblical interpretation within Christian faith would have improved the response."
