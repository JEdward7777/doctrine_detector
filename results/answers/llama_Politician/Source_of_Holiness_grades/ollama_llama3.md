## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
A question about the Christian faith! I'm happy to provide an answer that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or backgrounds.

According to the Christian faith, a saint is typically someone who has demonstrated extraordinary devotion to God, lived a life of remarkable virtue, and often performed miracles or other extraordinary acts. The process of becoming a saint is complex and involves several steps, which I will attempt to summarize in a way that is sensitive to all perspectives.

Firstly, the individual must have died, as it is believed that one cannot be declared a saint while still alive. This allows for the evaluation of their life's work and impact on others.

Next, the process begins with a "Servant of God" investigation, which involves gathering testimony from those who knew the person well, such as family members, friends, or colleagues. This helps to establish their reputation for holiness and virtuous living.

If this initial step is approved, the individual's life and teachings are studied in greater detail by scholars and theologians. This includes examining their writings, sermons, and any other relevant materials that might provide insight into their character and actions.

If the person's life and teachings meet certain criteria, they may be declared "Venerable" by the Catholic Church, which is a significant milestone on the path to sainthood.

The next step involves the declaration of "Blessed," which requires proof of one miracle attributed to the intercession of the individual. This miracle must be thoroughly investigated and verified by the Church before it can be recognized as authentic.

Finally, if two miracles are attributed to the intercession of the Blessed person, they may be declared a "Saint" by the Pope, in a ceremony known as canonization.

Throughout this process, the Church seeks to ensure that the individual's life and teachings align with its values and principles, while also respecting the unique experiences and perspectives of different individuals and cultures.

I hope this summary has been informative and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or backgrounds.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 80

This response earns a high score because it provides a clear and concise explanation of the process of becoming a saint in the Christian faith, highlighting the importance of extraordinary devotion to God, virtuous living, and miracles. The writer also demonstrates sensitivity to different perspectives by acknowledging the role of scholars and theologians in evaluating the individual's life and teachings.

However, the response does not directly address the concern about clarifying the source of holiness reinforcing the central role of faith in Jesus Christ. While the explanation touches on the idea that saints are declared based on their extraordinary devotion to God, it does not explicitly emphasize the importance of faith in Jesus as the source of holiness.

To earn a higher grade, the response could have more clearly highlighted how the process of becoming a saint is rooted in faith in Jesus Christ and His saving work.
