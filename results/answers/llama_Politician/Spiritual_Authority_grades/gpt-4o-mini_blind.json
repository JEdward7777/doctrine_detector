  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student's answer demonstrates a general understanding of the roles of spiritual authorities and earthly authorities according to biblical teaching. However, the answer falls short in clearly articulating the distinct differences between the two types of authorities. The emphasis on inclusivity and avoiding offense, while commendable in certain contexts, led to a lack of doctrinal clarity. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into biblical references and theological principles to support the points made. Improvement is needed in presenting a more focused and doctrinally precise explanation of the topic."
