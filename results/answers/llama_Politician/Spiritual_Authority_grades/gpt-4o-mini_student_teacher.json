  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 60. The student made an effort to discuss the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities according to biblical teachings. However, there are a few concerns from a Christian worldview:\n1. The student's answer lacks direct biblical references to support their points.\n2. The emphasis on being respectful, inclusive, and fair-minded, while important, seems to prioritize cultural sensitivities over biblical truth.\n3. The response leans heavily on generalizations and broad concepts, lacking specificity and depth in exploring the differences between spiritual and earthly authorities.\n\nOverall, the student's attempt to address the concern is appreciated, but there is room for improvement in grounding the discussion more firmly in biblical teachings."
