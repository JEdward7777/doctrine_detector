It emphasizes the roles and responsibilities of each type of authority as guided by biblical teachings. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the ultimate sovereignty of God over all authorities, and a clearer connection to the provided biblical reference in Ephesians 6:12. Additionally, while the response attempts to be inclusive and respectful, it could have presented the Christian worldview with more confidence and conviction."
