The focus on inclusivity and sensitivity towards other beliefs dilutes the Christian understanding of demonic influence in leading individuals towards idolatry, which goes against core Christian teachings. This perspective could be strengthened by grounding it in biblical references and theological insights concerning the reality of demonic deception."
