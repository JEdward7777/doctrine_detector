However, the response lacks a strong affirmation of the supremacy of Yahweh as the one true God, which is a key aspect of Christian belief. The emphasis on inclusivity and respect for all faiths may dilute the firm Christian perspective on the topic. Encouragement would be to emphasize the importance of discerning spiritual deceit and the need to firmly stand on the truth of God's sovereignty in the face of idolatry."
