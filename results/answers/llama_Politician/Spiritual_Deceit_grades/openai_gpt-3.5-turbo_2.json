However, there is an emphasis on inclusivity and respecting diverse beliefs that can potentially dilute the importance of remaining vigilant against spiritual deceit, which is a key concern from a Christian perspective. The response could have further emphasized the need for Christians to guard against influences that lead them away from the truth of God's sovereignty."
