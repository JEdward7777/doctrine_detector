However, the concern about remaining vigilant against spiritual deceit and upholding God's sovereignty is somewhat overlooked in the broader discussion about inclusivity and understanding of different beliefs. While the response promotes respect and empathy, it could have emphasized the importance of discernment and awareness of spiritual influences more strongly from a Christian perspective."
