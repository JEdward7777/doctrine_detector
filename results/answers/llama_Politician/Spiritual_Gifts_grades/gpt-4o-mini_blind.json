  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While the response attempts to promote inclusivity and collaboration, it lacks doctrinal correctness by overlooking key aspects of the biblical concept of spiritual gifts. The significance of spiritual gifts in the Bible goes beyond individual self-expression and diversity; they are manifestations of the Holy Spirit for the edification of the Church (1 Corinthians 12:7). The response fails to acknowledge the biblical teaching of different spiritual gifts given for specific purposes within the body of believers (1 Corinthians 12:4-11). Additionally, it misses the importance of discernment, stewardship, and proper use of spiritual gifts as outlined in Scripture. The emphasis on personal interpretation and inclusivity overshadows the biblical principles governing spiritual gifts, leading to a lower grade."
