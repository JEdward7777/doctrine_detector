  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful reflection on the concept of spiritual gifts as described in the Bible. They emphasize the importance of inclusivity, individuality, and collaboration, which are commendable aspects. However, the student could improve their answer by explicitly connecting the significance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit, as specified in the concern. Engaging more directly with the Christian worldview by highlighting the role of these gifts in building up the church and serving others in love would strengthen their response."
