It fails to highlight the exclusivity of salvation through Jesus Christ as a core belief of Christianity. This departure from a Christian-specific worldview weakens the response and diminishes the significance of salvation through faith in Jesus' redemptive sacrifice. An understanding rooted in Christian doctrine is crucial for a comprehensive grasp of salvation and its implications for faith and assurance of eternal life."
