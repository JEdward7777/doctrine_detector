However, it fails to directly address the concern about how understanding the concept of salvation can impact one's faith and assurance of eternal life. The focus on inclusivity and universal themes, while valuable, somewhat dilutes the significance of the Christian-specific understanding of salvation. More direct engagement with the concern and a clearer affirmation of the Christian perspective would have strengthened the response."
