The explanation demonstrates a deep understanding of the spiritual implications of physical practices in modern Christianity, showcasing the interconnectedness of symbolism and faith. The response could have further emphasized the centrality of Christ's sacrifice in this spiritual transformation, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern with a thoughtful and well-articulated response."
