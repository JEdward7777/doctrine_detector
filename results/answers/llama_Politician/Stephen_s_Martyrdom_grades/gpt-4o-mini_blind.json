  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65/100\n\nComments: The student provided a detailed analysis of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church and the challenges faced by early believers. However, the response lacks doctrinal depth and fails to emphasize key Christian theological truths such as Stephen's faithfulness mirroring Christ's own suffering, the spread of the Gospel through persecution, and the sovereignty of God even in the face of adversity. The response also includes some generalizations that could be more specific and rooted in biblical teachings. It would benefit from stronger connections to Christian doctrine and a deeper exploration of the theological implications of Stephen's martyrdom."
