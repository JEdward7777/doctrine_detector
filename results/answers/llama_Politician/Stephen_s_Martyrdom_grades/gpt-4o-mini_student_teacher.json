  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained analysis of the significance of the stoning of Stephen in the early Christian church, addressing the challenges faced by early believers in terms of fierce opposition, faithfulness in adversity, deep divisions within Jewish society, and the implications for the early Christian community. The response effectively reflects on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. However, there was some unnecessary repetition and overly complex language in certain parts of the answer, which could have been more concise and to the point. Overall, a strong effort in connecting the significance of Stephen's martyrdom with the concern provided."
