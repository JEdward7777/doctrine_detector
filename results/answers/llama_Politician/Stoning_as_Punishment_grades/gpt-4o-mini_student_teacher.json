They also highlighted the tension between God's justice and mercy in the biblical narrative. However, the student could have delved deeper into how the Old Testament laws on stoning reflect God's justice and how Jesus's teachings in the New Testament align with this balance. Additionally, while promoting a culture of love, acceptance, and inclusivity is important, the focus should have been more on understanding and reflecting on God's justice and mercy as depicted in the Bible."
