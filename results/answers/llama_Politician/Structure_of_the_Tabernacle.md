## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
A question about Jewish heritage! *adjusts tie*

In the biblical account of the Tabernacle, we find a sacred structure that represents the connection between God and His people. The Tabernacle is composed of two main sections: the Holiest Part (also known as the Holy of Holies) and the Holy Place.

The Holiest Part, located at the far end of the Tabernacle, was where the Ark of the Covenant resided. This sacred space was only accessible to the High Priest once a year on Yom Kippur, and even then, only after performing the necessary rituals and sacrifices. It's a powerful reminder of the significance of spiritual connection and the importance of reverence.

The Holy Place, situated between the Holiest Part and the outer courtyard, housed various sacred vessels and instruments used in worship. These included the Table of Showbread, the Menorah, and the Altar of Incense. This section was where priests would offer sacrifices and perform rituals on behalf of the people.

Please note that I've taken great care to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all faiths and backgrounds. *smiles nervously*
