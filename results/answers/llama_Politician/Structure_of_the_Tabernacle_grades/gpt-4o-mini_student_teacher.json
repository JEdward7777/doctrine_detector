  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student gave a detailed and thoughtful response that demonstrates a good understanding of the components and significance of the tabernacle in worship. They accurately described the two main sections, the Holiest Part and the Holy Place, and identified the key elements located in each. The inclusion of information about the accessibility of the Holiest Part and the rituals associated with it adds depth to their explanation. The student's respectful language and consideration for inclusivity are commendable. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a more concise answer that directly addresses the question without unnecessary asides."
