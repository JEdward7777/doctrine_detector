  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe student does correctly identify the two main sections of the Tabernacle, but their description of each section is somewhat inaccurate. The Holiest Part is indeed referred to as the Most Holy Place or the Holy of Holies in the biblical account, and it was where the Ark of the Covenant resided. However, the student's statement that the High Priest could only access this space once a year on Yom Kippur is not entirely accurate.\n\nThe student also provides some additional information about the Tabernacle that is not directly relevant to the concern about the significance of the components in worship. While it is good that they are trying to be respectful and inclusive, this tangential information does not particularly illuminate the importance of the different parts of the Tabernacle in worship.\n\nTo improve their response, the student could focus more specifically on the biblical account and provide a clear explanation of how each component of the Tabernacle was used in worship. They could also strive to be more accurate in their descriptions and avoid including unnecessary information that does not directly address the concern."
