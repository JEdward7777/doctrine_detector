  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student acknowledges the biblical reference to manna, the response falls short in presenting a clear and accurate interpretation from a Christian worldview. The emphasis on respecting diverse beliefs and perspectives detracts from providing a doctrinally sound understanding of manna as a symbol of God's provision. Encouragement is given for the student to focus on presenting biblical truths with clarity and confidence, even in a diverse and inclusive setting."
