  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and respectful of diverse beliefs, which is commendable. However, in the context of recognizing God's ongoing provision in the lives of believers, the student's answer lacks specificity and clarity. While they acknowledge the biblical interpretation of manna as a symbol of God's provision, they also dilute this by suggesting alternative interpretations. The student's response could be improved by focusing more specifically on how manna symbolizes God's ongoing provision for believers, aligning it more closely with the given reference answer."
