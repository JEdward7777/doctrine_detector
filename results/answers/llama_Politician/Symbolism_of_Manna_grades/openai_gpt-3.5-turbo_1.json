  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The response effectively acknowledges the biblical interpretation of manna as a symbol of God's provision for the Israelites. The candidate also demonstrates sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs, which is commendable. The only minor feedback would be to perhaps include a more direct reference to God's ongoing provision in the conclusion to tie back to the concern raised. Overall, a strong response with a solid Christian perspective."
