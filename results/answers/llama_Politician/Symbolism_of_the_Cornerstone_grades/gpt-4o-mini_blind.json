However, there are some weaknesses in the answer from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could have delved deeper into the biblical significance of the cornerstone metaphor, connecting it to Jesus being the cornerstone of the Church and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. Additionally, there is an overemphasis on inclusivity and potential misinterpretations that might dilute the doctrinal clarity of the metaphor. Encouraging empathy and understanding is important, but it should not overshadow the fundamental truths represented by the metaphor in Christian theology."
