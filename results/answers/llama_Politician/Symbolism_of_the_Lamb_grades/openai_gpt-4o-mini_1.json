To fully address the concern about understanding atonement and redemption through Christ, more emphasis on the theological significance of Christ as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb in Christian belief would have been beneficial. Additionally, there was a lack of depth in linking the concept of sacrifice to the Christian worldview."
