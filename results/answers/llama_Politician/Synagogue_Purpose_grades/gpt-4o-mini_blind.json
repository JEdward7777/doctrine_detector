  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive overview of the role of synagogues in ancient Jewish worship practices. The answer effectively conveys the importance of synagogues as central places for prayer, study, community gatherings, and cultural identity. However, there is room for improvement in terms of doctrinal accuracy and depth of theological reflection. Encouraging the student to incorporate more specific biblical references and theological insights would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
