The answer focused more on broad themes of unity, diversity, and cooperation rather than the specific purpose of the temple in biblical history. It lacked depth and accuracy in addressing the core function of the temple as a place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites. A more focused and accurate explanation rooted in the Old Testament context would have been more appropriate."
