The emphasis on unity, cooperation, and symbolic significance is valuable, but a more detailed exploration of the religious significance and practices associated with the temple would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, the importance of God's presence and the sacrificial system in the temple worship could have been elaborated upon to align more closely with a Christian understanding of the temple in Old Testament worship."
