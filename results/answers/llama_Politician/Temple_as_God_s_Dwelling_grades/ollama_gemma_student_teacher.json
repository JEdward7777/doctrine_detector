  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments. The student provides a clear and concise explanation of the physical temple in the Old Testament and its significance as a dwelling place for God, while also highlighting the shift in understanding in the New Testament where believers are referred to as the \"temple\" of the Holy Spirit. The inclusion of references from scripture and relevant passages adds credibility to the response."
