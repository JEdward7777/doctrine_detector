It skirts around the biblical account and lacks in-depth understanding of Christian beliefs. It also places an emphasis on inclusivity and diversity over the core Christian teachings, which is not in line with a Christian worldview. It is important for answers to this question to focus on the biblical narrative and the theological significance of Jesus' responses to Satan's temptations."
