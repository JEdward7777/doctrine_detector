  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response lacks depth and accuracy in addressing the question about Jesus' response to temptations presented by Satan. The answer fails to provide any specific details or insights from a Christian perspective. Instead, it focuses more on general sentiments of inclusivity and respect, which do not directly answer the question at hand. The lack of biblical knowledge and theological analysis is evident, resulting in a low grade for this response."
