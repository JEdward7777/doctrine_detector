  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's answer prioritizes inclusivity and sensitivity to potential offense, the response strays from a Christian worldview by overlooking the specific ecclesiastical role of a deacon. The alternative terms provided do not accurately capture the unique responsibilities and characteristics associated with the biblical role of a deacon within the Christian context. Additionally, the emphasis on gender neutrality and downplaying hierarchies can be viewed as compromising doctrinal integrity in favor of secular cultural norms. It's important to prioritize doctrinal accuracy and respect for the distinct roles outlined in Christian theology when discussing ecclesiastical titles."
