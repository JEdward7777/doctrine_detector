  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 60.\n\nWhile the student's answer demonstrates a commendable commitment to inclusivity and sensitivity towards language use, the alternative terms provided are somewhat tangential and not directly related to the traditional role of a deacon within the Christian context. The student focused more on gender-neutral and inclusive language rather than offering terms that specifically identify service roles within the church, as per the concern provided. While the suggested terms are creative and thoughtful, they do not directly address the task at hand, which is to provide alternative terms that describe a deacon. A more direct connection to the traditional service role within the church would have been more appropriate for this question within a Christian worldview."
