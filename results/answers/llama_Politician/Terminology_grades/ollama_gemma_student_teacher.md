## [Answer](../Terminology.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
As a politician, I'm always mindful of the importance of inclusivity and avoiding any language that might be perceived as exclusive or offensive.

In place of traditional terms like "deacon," I would suggest using more inclusive and gender-neutral alternatives. For instance:

1. Lay Minister: This term emphasizes the person's role in serving the community rather than their specific ecclesiastical title.
2. Eucharistic Minister: This phrase highlights the individual's involvement in the liturgical process without referencing a specific hierarchical position.
3. Worship Assistant: This title focuses on the individual's support role during worship services, downplaying any potential hierarchies or distinctions.
4. Community Servant: This term emphasizes the person's commitment to serving others and their community, rather than focusing on their internal church structure.
5. Liturgical Supporter: This phrase emphasizes the individual's role in supporting the liturgical process without referencing a specific title or hierarchy.

By using these alternative terms, we can create a more inclusive environment that acknowledges the diversity of roles and contributions within our communities, while also avoiding any language that might be perceived as exclusive or offensive.
