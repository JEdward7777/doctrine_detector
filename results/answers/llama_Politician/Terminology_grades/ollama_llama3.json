  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response does a good job of recognizing the importance of inclusivity and avoiding language that might be perceived as exclusive or offensive, which aligns with the concern of recognizing various ways to identify service roles within the church. However, while it provides some alternative terms for deacons, it doesn't explicitly address the different ways to identify deacon-like roles in the church. The provided answer, \"A deacon can also be referred to as a church minister, church worker, or church servant,\" is a good example of this, but the response could have built upon this idea by providing more suggestions for alternative titles and descriptions.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have explored other examples of how different service roles within the church might be identified, such as using terms like \"minister\" or \"servant\" to describe various functions rather than relying solely on traditional titles. Overall, while the response has some good points, it doesn't fully address the concern and could be improved by providing more comprehensive suggestions for recognizing and describing service roles within the church."
