  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides thoughtful and inclusive alternatives to the traditional term \"deacon\" by suggesting gender-neutral titles that focus on the individual's role in service rather than specific hierarchical positions. The use of terms like Lay Minister, Eucharistic Minister, Worship Assistant, Community Servant, and Liturgical Supporter shows an understanding of the diversity of service roles within the church. However, while the response successfully addresses the concern by proposing alternative terms, it could have also included more direct references to biblical principles or teachings related to service roles within the church from a Christian worldview perspective to enhance the theological foundation of the suggested alternatives."
