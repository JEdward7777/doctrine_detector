By solely focusing on inclusivity and avoiding potential offense, it neglects the theological and historical context of the term \"deacon\" and its role within the church. The proposed alternatives, while well-intentioned, may dilute the distinctiveness and biblical significance of the office of deacon. A more balanced approach that values inclusivity while also respecting the unique roles and titles within the church would have been more appropriate from a Christian worldview perspective."
