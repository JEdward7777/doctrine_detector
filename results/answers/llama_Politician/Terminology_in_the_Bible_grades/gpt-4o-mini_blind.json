However, from a Christian specific worldview, the emphasis on inclusivity and shared heritage among different faiths could potentially dilute the uniqueness and significance of God's chosen people as depicted in the Bible. A more doctrinally correct response would focus on the biblical origins and implications of these terms within the context of God's covenant with Israel, without diluting their theological distinctiveness."
