  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the different terms used to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible. However, the concern specified the importance of recognizing that these terms are often used interchangeably. The student's answer focused more on the distinct meanings and historical contexts of each term, deviating slightly from the concern. While the additional information provided by the student is valuable, the primary focus should have been on the interchangeability of the terms as mentioned in the reference answer."
