  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a Christian-specific viewpoint and fails to address the given concern about maintaining a proper relationship with God. Instead of focusing on the biblical reasons behind why it is considered wrong to put God to the test, the student veers off into general statements about inclusivity and tolerance. The answer does not align with a Christian worldview and does not effectively address the question at hand."
