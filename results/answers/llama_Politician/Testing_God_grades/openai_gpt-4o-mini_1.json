However, the response falls short in addressing the concern adequately. The emphasis on inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all perspectives may risk diluting the importance of acknowledging God's authority and holiness. While promoting dialogue and understanding is important, the response could have emphasized more explicitly the significance of honoring God's sovereignty and not testing His power."
