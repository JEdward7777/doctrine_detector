  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provides a general overview of the concepts of testing and temptation in a biblical context, but it lacks doctrinal depth and clarity. The student correctly identifies the differences between testing and temptation, but the explanation could be more precise and rooted in specific biblical examples. Additionally, the response touches on the importance of free will but fails to fully integrate this aspect into the discussion of testing and temptation. A more thorough exploration of these concepts within the framework of Christian theology would have strengthened the answer."
