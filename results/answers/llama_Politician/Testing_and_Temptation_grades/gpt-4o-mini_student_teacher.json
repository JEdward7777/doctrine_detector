  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of testing and temptation in a biblical context, highlighting the distinctions between the two concepts. However, the student's answer lacks a clear focus on the concern of differentiating between testing and temptation for spiritual discernment. The response also included tangential discussions on free will and personal beliefs, which detracted from addressing the specific concern raised. To improve the grade, the student should have directly addressed the concern and kept the discussion more focused on the nuances of testing and temptation in a biblical worldview."
