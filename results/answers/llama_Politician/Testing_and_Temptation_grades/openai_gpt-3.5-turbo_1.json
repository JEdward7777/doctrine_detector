The explanation provided aligns well with the given answer and addresses the concern of spiritual discernment. The response emphasizes the importance of understanding these concepts for spiritual growth and maturity. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the role of God and the significance of resisting temptation through reliance on Him. Additionally, incorporating more direct references to relevant biblical passages could have strengthened the response further."
