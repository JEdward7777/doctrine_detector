  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the concepts of testing and temptation in a biblical context, drawing a clear distinction between the two. It acknowledges the importance of understanding these concepts for spiritual discernment, aligning well with the concern provided. The only area for improvement would be to emphasize more explicitly the role of God in initiating testing and how individuals can respond to both testing and temptation in light of their faith. Overall, a strong and well-articulated response."
