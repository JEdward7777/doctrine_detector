The emphasis on acknowledging and respecting diverse beliefs and practices, while important, somewhat dilutes the Christian perspective on the issue. There could have been a stronger emphasis on the biblical teachings regarding perseverance in faith and how it relates to 'keeping the faith' within a Christian context."
