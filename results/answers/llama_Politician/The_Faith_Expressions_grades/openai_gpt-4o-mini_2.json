However, the emphasis on inclusivity, diversity of beliefs, and respect for all faiths may dilute the importance of perseverance in the Christian faith specifically. While promoting unity and understanding is commendable, the Christian worldview places a strong emphasis on remaining steadfast in one's faith in Jesus Christ, which could have been highlighted more prominently in the response."
