  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely misses the specific command given by Jesus to His disciples before ascending to heaven, which is crucial for understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission. Instead, the student focuses on vague generalities and avoids addressing the core Christian worldview perspective. It is important to engage with the specific teachings and commands of Jesus in this context to accurately assess the response."
