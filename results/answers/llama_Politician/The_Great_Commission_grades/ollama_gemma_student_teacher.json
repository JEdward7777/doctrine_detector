  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and inclusive approach to the question, emphasizing the importance of respecting diverse beliefs and values. However, it lacks specificity in addressing the given concern about understanding the mission of discipleship in the context of the Great Commission. While the student provides relevant insights on Jesus' teachings and universal values, the response does not directly address the command given to Jesus' disciples before ascending to heaven."
