  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments:\nThe student's response does a fair job of explaining the relationship between the terms \"Jesus\" and \"Christ\" with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives. However, there are areas where the answer could have been more doctrinally precise and clear. The student could have emphasized the theological significance of the title \"Christ\" more explicitly in relation to Jesus as the promised Messiah and Savior in Christian belief. Additionally, the avoidance of controversy sometimes led to vague language that diluted the depth of the explanation. Encouraging further study and grounding the answer more firmly in Christian doctrine would have improved the response."
