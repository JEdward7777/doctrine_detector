The response could have been improved by focusing more directly on this specific aspect rather than delving into broader nuances of the terms \"Jesus\" and \"Christ.\" Nonetheless, the explanation given aligns well with Christian beliefs and effectively addresses the concern regarding Jesus's identity as the Messiah."
