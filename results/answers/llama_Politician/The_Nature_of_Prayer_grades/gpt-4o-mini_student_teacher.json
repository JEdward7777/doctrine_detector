  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear distinction between praying to the true God and talking to a false god. While the student discusses the importance and benefits of prayer, they fail to address the specific concern of understanding the difference between praying to the true God and communicating with a false god. The focus on inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs, while important, does not directly address the concern at hand from a Christian worldview."
