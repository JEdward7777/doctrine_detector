However, it falls short in properly addressing the concern about distinguishing true prayer from false practices. While the response promotes inclusivity and respect, it lacks a clear stance on the distinction between communicating with the true God versus false gods. A more direct and discerning approach grounded in Christian teachings on prayer would have strengthened the response."
