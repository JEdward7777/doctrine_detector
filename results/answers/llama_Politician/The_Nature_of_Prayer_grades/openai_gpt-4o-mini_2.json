However, it does not directly address the concern of understanding the proper approach to prayer and distinguishing it from false practices as explicitly as the given answer suggests. More emphasis could have been placed on the importance of aligning prayer with a true relationship with God and emphasizing the significance of discerning between authentic spiritual communion and potentially misleading practices."
