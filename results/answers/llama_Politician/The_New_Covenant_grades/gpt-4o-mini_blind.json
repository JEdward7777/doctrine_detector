  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student provided a generally sound explanation of the concept of God writing His law on people's hearts in the New Covenant. The answer emphasizes the personal and transformative nature of this action, highlighting the internal guidance and moral compass it provides. However, there are a few areas for improvement. The answer could have delved deeper into the significance of this divine action in the context of Christ's work on the cross and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Additionally, there was a lack of emphasis on the importance of obedience and submission to God's will as a response to having His law written on our hearts. Overall, a well-explained response but with room for theological enhancement."
