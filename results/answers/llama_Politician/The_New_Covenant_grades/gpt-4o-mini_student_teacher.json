  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thoughtful and reflective interpretation of the concept of God writing His law on people's hearts in the New Covenant. The student effectively expresses the idea of internalization and transformation, highlighting the personal relationship aspect and the intrinsic motivation to follow God's will. However, the response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant, which was the specified concern. Additionally, while the student's explanation was engaging and well-phrased, it could have delved deeper into the theological implications and significance of this transition within a Christian worldview."
