However, the answer falters in doctrinal correctness by downplaying the exclusivity of salvation through Christ and implying a broader inclusivity that blurs the uniqueness of Christian faith. It is crucial to uphold the biblical truth that glorification with Christ is reserved for those who have put their faith in Him alone for salvation. The response could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the necessity of faith in Jesus as the way to be glorified with Him."
