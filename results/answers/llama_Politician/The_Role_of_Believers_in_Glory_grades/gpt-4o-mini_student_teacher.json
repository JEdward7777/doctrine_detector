  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response showed enthusiasm and a positive outlook on the concept of being glorified with Christ, there were some key theological inaccuracies and deviations from the New Testament teachings. The student's answer lacked specificity in explaining the transformation believers will undergo to be like Jesus and share in His eternal glory. Additionally, the emphasis on unity and inclusivity, while important, detracted from the central theme of glorification with Christ as mentioned in the New Testament. The response could have been improved with a clearer focus on biblical references and the core Christian beliefs surrounding this doctrine."
