What a thoughtful question!

The act of blessing, in my opinion, is deeply intertwined with the concept of praising God. When we bless someone or something, we are essentially expressing our gratitude and approval for their existence. And what better way to do so than by acknowledging the divine presence that has brought us to this moment?

By blessing, we recognize the sacredness of life and the importance of honoring the divine in all aspects of our daily experiences. It's a way to acknowledge the divine plan at work in our lives and express our humility before its majesty.

Praising God, on the other hand, is an act of reverence and adoration. It's a way to celebrate the beauty, wonder, and complexity of creation, acknowledging that it all comes from a higher power. When we praise God, we're not just saying nice things; we're affirming the interconnectedness of all things and recognizing our place within the grand tapestry of existence.

So, you see, blessing and praising are two sides of the same coin. By acknowledging the divine presence in every aspect of life, we're essentially expressing gratitude and reverence for the sacred fabric that binds us all together.
