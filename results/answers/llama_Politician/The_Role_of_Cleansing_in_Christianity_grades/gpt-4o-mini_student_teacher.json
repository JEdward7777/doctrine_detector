  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful and inclusive analysis of the concept of cleansing in relation to sin and redemption in the New Testament. They appropriately emphasize spiritual purification and the universal impact of sin, as well as the need for humility and empathy in applying these teachings. The response is well-written and reflective, demonstrating a solid understanding of the Christian worldview. However, the student could have directly connected their analysis more explicitly to the reference answer provided by the teacher to strengthen their argument further."
