The inclusion of relevant Bible verses and the emphasis on spiritual purification are strong points. However, the response could benefit from further incorporating the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings to highlight the continuity and fulfillment in Christ's redemptive work. Nevertheless, the tone of empathy, inclusivity, and reflection of God's love align well with Christian values."
