The connection to Jesus' sacrifice for cleansing from sin is well articulated. However, the response could have been enhanced by more explicit reference to the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings to deepen the understanding of Christ's redemptive work. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic and effectively conveys key Christian principles."
