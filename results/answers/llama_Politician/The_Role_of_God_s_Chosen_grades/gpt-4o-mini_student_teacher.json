  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student's response shows effort in exploring the topic from various angles, it falls short in explicitly recognizing and emphasizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders. The student touches on the concept of being \"chosen\" but does not clearly tie it back to God's divine purpose and plans. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the biblical context and implications of God's selection process as demonstrated through Moses and King David.\n\nOverall, the student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the topic but lacks a strong focus on recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders within the Christian worldview."
