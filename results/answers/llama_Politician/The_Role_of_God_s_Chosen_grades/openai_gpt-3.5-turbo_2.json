However, the concern about recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders is not directly addressed. The response emphasizes inclusivity, diversity, and equity, which are valuable considerations, but could have been more explicitly connected to the theme of God's sovereignty in leadership appointments within a Christian worldview. The response does provide a respectful and inclusive perspective, but could have strengthened its Christian specificity by directly discussing the implications of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders for the Christian community."
