However, the concern for the Christian community is not directly addressed throughout the response. The answer focuses more on inclusivity, diversity, and equity, which are important considerations but may not fully align with the specified concern of recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders. The response could have emphasized more on how the selection of leaders by God impacts the Christian community specifically."
