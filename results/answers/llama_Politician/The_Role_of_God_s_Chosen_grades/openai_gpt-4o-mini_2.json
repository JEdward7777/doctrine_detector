However, there is an emphasis on inclusivity, diversity, and equity that slightly detracts from the focus on God's sovereignty in appointing leaders within the Christian community. While it is commendable to promote inclusivity, the response could have strengthened the connection between God's sovereignty and leadership roles within the Christian faith for a more cohesive integration of the concern provided."
