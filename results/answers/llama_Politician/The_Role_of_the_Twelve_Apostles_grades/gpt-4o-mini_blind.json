  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the student touched on the importance of the twelve apostles in Christianity, the response lacked doctrinal correctness and clarity. The emphasis on inclusivity, while a noble sentiment, detracted from the central role the twelve apostles played in Jesus' ministry and the establishment of the early Christian Church. The response would benefit from a more focused and doctrinally accurate explanation of the significance of the twelve apostles within the context of Christian belief."
