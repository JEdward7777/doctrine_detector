  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student's response acknowledges the importance of the apostles and their impact on spreading Jesus' message of love and redemption, the answer strays too far from the Christian-specific worldview by emphasizing inclusivity of all faiths and promoting diverse perspectives. The concern specifically asked for recognition of the apostles' significance in Christian belief and ministry. The student should have focused more on the biblical role of the twelve apostles as chosen by Jesus to continue His teachings, rather than broadening the discussion to encompass various faiths and marginalized groups."
