While it is commendable to highlight the contributions of women in Jesus' circle, the response could have strengthened its Christian perspective by focusing more on the apostles' specific mission and their role in establishing the early Christian church. Further incorporation of Christian teachings and scriptural references would have enhanced the response's alignment with a Christian worldview."
