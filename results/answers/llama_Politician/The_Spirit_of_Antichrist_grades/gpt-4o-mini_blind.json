However, it falls short in clearly articulating the doctrinal perspective on the spirit of antichrist as presented in the Bible. The student should have focused more on explaining the biblical teachings and implications concerning the spirit of antichrist rather than solely emphasizing empathy and understanding. Greater emphasis on the scriptural context and implications would have improved the doctrinal accuracy of the response."
