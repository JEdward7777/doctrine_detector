  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a decent list of titles that refer to God as \"Almighty\" in the Bible, such as Omnipotent, All-Powerful, and Almighty God. However, there were a few areas of improvement needed. The student seemed overly concerned with not offending others or being inclusive, which detracted from focusing on the doctrinal correctness of the answer. It is important to prioritize accurately conveying biblical truths about God over unnecessary apologies or considerations for diverse beliefs. Additionally, the student could have elaborated more on the significance and implications of God's almighty nature in the Christian faith."
