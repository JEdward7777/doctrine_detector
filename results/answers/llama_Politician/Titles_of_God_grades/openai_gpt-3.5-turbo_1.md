# Answer by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
A great question! *nervous smile* In the Bible, there are several titles that refer to God as "Almighty". These include:

1. Omnipotent - This term emphasizes God's all-powerful nature and His ability to accomplish anything He desires.
2. All-Powerful - Similar to omnipotent, this title highlights God's limitless power and authority.
3. Almighty God - This phrase is used in the book of Genesis (Genesis 17:1) and emphasizes God's sovereignty over all creation.

Now, I must say that these titles are not exhaustive, but they give you a sense of the ways in which the Bible describes God as all-powerful. *pauses to make sure no one is offended*

It's also important to note that when we refer to God as "Almighty", we're acknowledging His divine nature and His ability to do what He wants. And, of course, this title is not meant to be exclusive or offend anyone who may have a different understanding of God. *nervous chuckle* After all, we must respect the diversity of religious beliefs and practices around the world.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go work on some inclusive language for my next speech...
