However, the inclusion of nervousness, pauses, and making sure not to offend detracts from the confidence and clarity needed in discussing theological concepts from a Christian worldview. The attempt to emphasize inclusivity, while commendable, should not overshadow the importance of accurately conveying biblical truths."
