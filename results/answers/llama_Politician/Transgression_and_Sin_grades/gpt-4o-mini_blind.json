  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student attempts to address the concept of transgression in relation to sin and disobedience, the response lacks doctrinal clarity and does not uphold a Christian worldview on the topic. The answer focuses more on secular perspectives of sin and disobedience, emphasizing inclusivity and societal structures over biblical truths. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate scriptural references and emphasize the need for repentance and redemption through Christ in discussing transgression, sin, and disobedience."
