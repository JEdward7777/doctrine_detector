The response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, there could be more emphasis on the spiritual and theological reasons behind the shift from the tabernacle to the temple, as well as the biblical context for this transition in God's plan for His people. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological reflection."
