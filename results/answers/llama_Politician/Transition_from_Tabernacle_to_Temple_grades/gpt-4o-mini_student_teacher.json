  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written and thorough response that demonstrates a good understanding of the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple. They accurately explain that the Israelites stopped using the tabernacle when the temple was built by Solomon in Jerusalem. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern raised about the transition in worship practices and providing more specific details or connections between the tabernacle and the temple."
