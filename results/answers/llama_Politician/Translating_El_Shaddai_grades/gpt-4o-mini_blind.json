However, from a Christian worldview perspective, there are some key aspects missing. The answer does not address the original theological significance of \"El Shaddai\" in the Hebrew Bible, which is important for maintaining doctrinal correctness in translation. The focus on cultural sensitivity should be balanced with preserving the theological essence of the term. It would be beneficial to emphasize the importance of consulting Scripture and theological experts to ensure the accurate representation of God's attributes in different translations."
