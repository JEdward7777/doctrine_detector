  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of accurately representing God's name across different cultures and languages, which aligns with the Christian worldview concern. The suggestion to translate \"El Shaddai\" as \"God Almighty\" or keep it as \"Shaddai\" if there is no existing translation is appropriate. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of maintaining the theological and cultural nuances associated with the term while ensuring accuracy in translation. Additionally, incorporating the consultation of local Bible translations and scholars as mentioned in the first response would have enhanced the depth of the answer, earning a higher grade."
