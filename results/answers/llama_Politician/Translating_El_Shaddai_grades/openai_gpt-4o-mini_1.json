The emphasis on consulting experts and being mindful of the linguistic and cultural contexts is commendable. The suggested translations of 'God Almighty' or 'Shaddai' based on phonetics are appropriate and show consideration for accurately representing God's name. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of upholding the sanctity and reverence associated with the name of God across all translations."
