The emphasis on consulting experts and considering cultural nuances is commendable. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of the term \"El Shaddai\" and how it reflects aspects of God's character beyond just power and authority. Additionally, while addressing potential cultural and religious sensitivities is important, a stronger affirmation of the uniqueness of God's name could have been beneficial from a Christian worldview perspective. Overall, the response provides a good foundation but could have offered more thorough theological insights."
