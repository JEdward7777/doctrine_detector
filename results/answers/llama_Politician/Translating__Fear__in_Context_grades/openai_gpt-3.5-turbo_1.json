It appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the nuances of fear to cultivate a proper attitude towards God. However, the response could have further emphasized the potential negative implications of misinterpreting fear of God, such as instilling unhealthy fear or undermining one's relationship with God, to strengthen the Christian perspective."
