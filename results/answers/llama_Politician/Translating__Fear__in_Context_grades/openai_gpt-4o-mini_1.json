However, while it acknowledges the importance of understanding these nuances, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of potential misinterpretation of fear leading to a distorted view of God. More explicit connections between the diverse interpretations discussed and how they can prevent a distorted view of God would strengthen the response and align it more closely with a Christian worldview perspective."
