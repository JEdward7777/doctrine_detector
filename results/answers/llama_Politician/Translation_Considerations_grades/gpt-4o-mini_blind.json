  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student acknowledges the cultural significance of retaining the terms \"Zion\" and \"Daughter\" in biblical translations, the answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview. It does not delve into the theological or doctrinal reasons for the importance of these terms in the biblical context. To improve, the student should incorporate scriptural references and theological insights that highlight the significance of \"Zion\" and \"Daughter\" within Christian theology and doctrine."
