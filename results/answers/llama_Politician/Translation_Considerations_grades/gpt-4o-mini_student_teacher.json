  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student correctly recognizes the importance of retaining the terms \"Zion\" and \"Daughter\" in biblical translations for their cultural and spiritual significance, their answer incorporates unnecessary elements that do not directly address the concern of ensuring the adequate conveyance of the original text's spiritual and cultural significance. The response would have been improved by focusing more on the specific figurative meanings carried by these terms and their connection to Biblical heritage and teachings, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a general understanding of the significance of retaining these terms but could have provided a more direct and concise response to the concern raised."
