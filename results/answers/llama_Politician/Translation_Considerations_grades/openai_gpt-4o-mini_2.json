The writer provides a well-reasoned argument supporting the retention of the terms \"Zion\" and \"Daughter\" in biblical translations, highlighting their rich figurative meanings and cultural importance. The response is respectful, thoughtful, and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian perspective. Great job!"
