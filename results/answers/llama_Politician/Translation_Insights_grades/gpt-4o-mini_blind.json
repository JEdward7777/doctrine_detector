  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has made an effort to provide thoughtful suggestions for translations of the phrase \"image of God\" when applied to humans and Jesus. However, from a Christian perspective, the answer lacks a clear theological foundation and does not adequately highlight the doctrinal significance of being made in the image of God. The response focuses more on general moral and philosophical concepts rather than diving into the theological implications of this crucial biblical concept. Additionally, there is a lack of connection to specific scriptural references or theological teachings that underpin the concept of the image of God. Overall, while the suggestions provided are thoughtful, they do not sufficiently reflect a Christian-specific worldview."
