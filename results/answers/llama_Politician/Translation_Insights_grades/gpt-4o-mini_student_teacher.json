  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85. \n\nWhile the student provided thoughtful and elaborate translations for the phrase 'image of God' applied to humans and Jesus, and highlighted the significance of these translations effectively, there are a few areas that could be improved. \n\nThe student could strengthen their answer by directly addressing the concern of exploring the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. They could incorporate more explicit connections between the translations they presented and how they impact the interpretation of biblical teachings. Additionally, the student could tie their suggested translations more closely to the reference answer provided by the teacher for a more comprehensive discussion. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a deep understanding of the topic and provided insightful insights, but there is room for improvement in connecting their responses directly to the concern raised in the question."
