However, the response could have been improved by emphasizing more on the historical tradition of the Jewish people fearing to mispronounce 'Yahweh,' which is a crucial aspect in this context. Additionally, the student could have tied in more explicitly how using 'LORD' in translations maintains reverence for God's name."
