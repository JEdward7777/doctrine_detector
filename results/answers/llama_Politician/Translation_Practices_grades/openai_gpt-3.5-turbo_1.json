The inclusion of interfaith dialogue, cultural sensitivity, and universal message aspects enriches the discussion. However, there could have been a more direct connection to the concern of clarity in translation and reverence for God's name, as mentioned in the original answer. Strengthening this link would have further enhanced the response."
