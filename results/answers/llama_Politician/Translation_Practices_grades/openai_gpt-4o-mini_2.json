However, the response could have more directly addressed the concern of clarity in translation and maintaining reverence for God's name by clearly emphasizing the significance of accurately conveying the divine name in a respectful manner. Additionally, while the response touched on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, it could have delved deeper into the importance of preserving the sacredness of God's name in translations."
