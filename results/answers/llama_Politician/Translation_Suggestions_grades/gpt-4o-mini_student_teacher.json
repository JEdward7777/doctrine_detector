  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided thoughtful alternative translations that aim to maintain the essence of fervent commitment without crossing into extremism, they could have incorporated more direct translations similar to the reference answer. Additionally, their response could have included more explicit ties to biblical contexts or examples to strengthen the connection to the Christian faith. Overall, a commendable effort, but room for improvement in alignment with the provided concern."
