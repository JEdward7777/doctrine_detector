A most excellent question, my friend! When considering alternative translations for "to be zealous" in a biblical context, we must strive to convey the same sense of fervent devotion and passion while avoiding any potential misunderstandings or sensitivities.

Here are some suggestions that might better capture the essence of this phrase:

1. To be ardently committed: This translation conveys a strong sense of dedication and enthusiasm without necessarily implying an excessive or overly intense attitude.
2. To demonstrate unwavering fervency: This phrasing emphasizes the intensity of one's commitment while avoiding any potential connotations of extremism or fanaticism.
3. To exhibit unrelenting passion: By using "unrelenting," we can convey a sense of persistence and endurance, rather than suggesting a reckless or imprudent approach.
4. To display intense devotion: This translation highlights the depth of one's feelings and commitment without implying an over-the-top or dramatic response.
5. To show great dedication: This phrasing emphasizes the gravity of one's commitment, focusing on the importance of their cause rather than any perceived intensity.

In using these alternatives, we can ensure that our language is both respectful and effective in conveying the original meaning while minimizing potential misunderstandings or offense.
