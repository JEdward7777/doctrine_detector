As a sensitive and inclusive leader, I believe it's essential to acknowledge the importance of language in fostering understanding and respect among diverse communities.

Regarding "covenant faithfulness," I would propose the following alternative translations to ensure that our message resonates with people from various backgrounds:

1. Commitment to mutual responsibility: This phrase conveys a sense of trust, loyalty, and shared obligation, which are essential components of any covenantal relationship.
2. Sacred promise-keeping: By emphasizing the sacred nature of promises, we emphasize the gravity and importance of honoring one's commitments.
3. Faithful partnership: This translation highlights the cooperative aspect of covenants, underscoring the value of working together in harmony and trust.
4. Relational integrity: This phrase emphasizes the importance of honesty, transparency, and sincerity in our interactions with others, which are core values underlying covenantal relationships.
