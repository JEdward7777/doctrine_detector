  "grade_comment": "This response provides a thoughtful reflection on the usage of the term \"Lord\" in different contexts, emphasizing respect, inclusivity, and sensitivity. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, there are some doctrinal considerations to take into account. While the answer touches on the importance of reverence for God when using the term \"Lord,\" it does not explicitly highlight the unique and divine status of God as Lord compared to ordinary people. Additionally, the response leans slightly towards a more relativistic view on language usage, which may not align completely with a Christian perspective that upholds absolute truth and standards.\n\nGrade: 75\n\nComment: The student showed a good understanding of the importance of respect and inclusivity in language usage, but could benefit from reinforcing the distinctiveness and reverence due to God as Lord in Christian theology. The answer would be strengthened by incorporating more emphasis on the scriptural basis for viewing God as the ultimate and supreme Lord."
