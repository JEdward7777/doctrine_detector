  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response shows thoughtful consideration of the importance of language and respect for individuals, the focus was more on general language usage rather than specifically addressing the translation of 'Lord' in biblical contexts. The student did not directly address the significance of capitalizing 'Lord' when referring to God, which is crucial in understanding the weight and reverence associated with the term in a Christian context. The response could have benefited from more explicit connections to the biblical use of the term 'Lord' and its implications for understanding scripture and the nature of God."
