However, the response could have directly addressed the concern by emphasizing the significance of accurately translating and interpreting biblical terms, especially in relation to understanding the nature of God as revealed in scripture. Additionally, a more explicit connection to Christian teachings or theological perspectives would have strengthened the response."
