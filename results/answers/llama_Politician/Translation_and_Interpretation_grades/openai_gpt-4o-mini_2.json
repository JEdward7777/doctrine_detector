  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of using respectful terms when referring to God, specifically noting the capitalization of \"Lord\" as a title for God. However, the response lacks a clear connection to the concern about the impact of proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms on understanding scripture and the nature of God. While promoting inclusivity and respect in language is commendable, a more direct integration of biblical principles and their implications for terminology could have strengthened the response."
