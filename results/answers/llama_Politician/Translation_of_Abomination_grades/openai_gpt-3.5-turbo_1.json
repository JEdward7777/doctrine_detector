The suggested phrases lack the specificity and directness needed to accurately depict actions that are considered morally reprehensible in a biblical context. It is important to prioritize conveying the true meaning and intensity of God's stance on certain behaviors in translations of biblical texts, and the proposed alternatives may dilute that significance. The response does make an effort to promote inclusivity and respectful dialogue, but in a Christian worldview, accuracy and fidelity to biblical teachings should be paramount."
