The suggested phrases offer respectful alternatives and demonstrate a desire to convey the original meaning without causing offense or marginalization. However, there could be a bit more emphasis on the absolute nature of the term \"abomination\" in biblical contexts to fully capture the severity of actions that go against God's laws."
