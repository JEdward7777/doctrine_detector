The suggestions align with the concern for accurate translation of biblical texts. However, there is potential to further emphasize the severity of actions against God's laws and the biblical significance of the term \"abomination\" within a Christian worldview. Additionally, the response could have incorporated more direct references to Scripture to support the proposed translations."
