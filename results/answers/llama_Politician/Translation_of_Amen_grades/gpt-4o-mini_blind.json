  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response demonstrates a creative and engaging writing style, it lacks doctrinal correctness and specificity in addressing the potential translations of \"truly\" as used by Jesus. The answer focuses more on linguistic nuances and cultural sensitivity rather than offering a clear Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, the response does not prioritize the theological significance of Jesus' words, which is essential when discussing biblical translations. Moving forward, the student should strive to incorporate more doctrinal accuracy and depth in their explanations."
