  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student's response shows creativity and an effort to engage with the question, they did not provide a direct and accurate translation of \"truly\" as used by Jesus. The student also focused more on the aesthetic aspects of language rather than the crucial importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. \n\nThe response lacks depth in terms of biblical understanding and does not align closely enough with the reference answer provided by the teacher. However, the student showed enthusiasm and an attempt to consider diverse perspectives, which are positive aspects of their response."
