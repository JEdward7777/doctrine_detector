The emphasis on various creative translations without directly connecting them to the importance of accurately conveying the intended meaning of Jesus' words falls short of addressing the concern provided. The response could have benefited from a deeper analysis of the specific biblical context and theological significance of translating \"truly\" in a faithful and accurate manner."
