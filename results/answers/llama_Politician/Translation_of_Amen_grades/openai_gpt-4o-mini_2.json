  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response showcases creativity and an engaging writing style, it strays off the concern of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. The multiple interpretations provided, while imaginative, do not directly address the given answer or emphasize the significance of precise translation in conveying the original meaning of Jesus' words. The focus on cultural nuances and shared humanity, while valuable in some contexts, detracts from the explicit concern at hand. More alignment with accurate scriptural interpretation would have warranted a higher grade."
