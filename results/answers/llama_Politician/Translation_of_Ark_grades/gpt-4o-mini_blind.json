  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive exploration of the term \"ark\" within different biblical contexts, showcasing an understanding of the linguistic nuances involved in translation. However, the response lacks doctrinal clarity and fails to delve deeply into the theological significance of the term \"ark\" within Christian theology. While acknowledging the importance of cultural sensitivity is commendable, a Christian-specific worldview would prioritize the theological implications and symbolism of the ark, such as its representation of salvation and Christ as the ultimate ark of safety. Integrating more doctrinal depth and theological insights within the response would enhance its overall quality from a Christian perspective."
