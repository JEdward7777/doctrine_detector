While the suggested translations aim to be inclusive, they stray away from the Christian worldview and do not accurately reflect the meaning of the term \"church\" within Christian denominations. The response should have emphasized the biblical understanding of the term \"church\" as the body of Christ or the assembly of believers gathered in His name."
