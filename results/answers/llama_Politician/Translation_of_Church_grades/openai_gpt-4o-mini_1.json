  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern by providing alternative translations that accurately represent the inclusive nature of the church. The suggestions offered are thoughtful and address the concern effectively. However, a slightly higher grade could be achieved by incorporating more direct references to Christian-specific language or terminology to further emphasize the inclusivity within the Christian context."
