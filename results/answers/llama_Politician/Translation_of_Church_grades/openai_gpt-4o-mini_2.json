  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides thoughtful and inclusive alternative translations for the term \"church\" that accurately represent the church's inclusive nature. The suggested phrases offered in the response align well with the concern of accurately representing inclusivity within the context of the church. However, the response could have further elaborated on how these alternative translations specifically reflect the inclusive nature of the church within a Christian worldview, providing more explicit connections to Christian beliefs about the unity of believers in Christ."
