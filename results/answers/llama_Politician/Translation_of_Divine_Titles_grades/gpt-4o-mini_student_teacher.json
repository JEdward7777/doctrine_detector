  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of translating \"Lord Yahweh\" with reverence and care, considering cultural sensitivity. The suggestions provided are thoughtful and respectful. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific translation aspect, as the reference answer emphasizes the translation options of 'Lord God' or 'God who is the Lord' and considering the grammatical structure in the target language. The student's response could have been more concise and directly addressed the translation aspect highlighted in the question. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in aligning more closely with the specific concern raised."
