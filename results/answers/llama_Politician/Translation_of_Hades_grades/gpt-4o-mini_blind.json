  "grade_comment": "Grade: 78\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful exploration of alternative translations for \"Hades\" and \"Sheol\" that respect their biblical meanings. The student demonstrates a commendable effort to address potential misconceptions and nuances in the translation of these terms. However, there is a missed opportunity to emphasize the theological significance of these terms within a Christian framework. A stronger connection to the biblical context and theological implications would have enhanced the overall response."
