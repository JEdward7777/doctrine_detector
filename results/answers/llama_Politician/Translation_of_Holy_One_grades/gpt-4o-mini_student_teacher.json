  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out and culturally sensitive response to the question of translating \"Holy One\" into different languages. They demonstrated an understanding of the importance of maintaining reverence and divinity in translations. However, they could improve their grade by focusing more directly on the theological implications of the term and ensuring that the translations retain the core meaning of holiness or 'the Set Apart One,' as emphasized in the reference answer."
