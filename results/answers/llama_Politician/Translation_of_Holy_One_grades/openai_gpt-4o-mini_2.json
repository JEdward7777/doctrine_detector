It appropriately addresses the concern by suggesting translations that retain the meaning of holiness and respect diverse religious traditions. However, a more explicit connection to maintaining theological accuracy throughout the translations could have strengthened the Christian-specific worldview perspective. Overall, a thorough and respectful analysis."
