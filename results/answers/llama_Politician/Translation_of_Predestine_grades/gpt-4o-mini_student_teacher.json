  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's response completely missed the mark in terms of providing accurate translations related to predestination from a biblical perspective. The suggested alternatives offered by the student lack the precision and theological depth required to convey the full meaning of \"predestined\" as understood within Christian doctrine. The focus on avoiding offense and being inclusive strays away from the core principles of biblical translation accuracy in this context."
