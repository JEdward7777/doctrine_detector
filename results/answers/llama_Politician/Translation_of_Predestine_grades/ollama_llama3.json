The suggested alternative phrases are thoughtful and nuanced, reflecting a careful consideration of how language can be used to convey complex ideas while avoiding offense.\n\nThe only deduction is that the response does not directly address the biblical translations related to predestination as specified in the concern. While the original answer provides some possible translations, it does not explore the biblical context or implications further. Nevertheless, the response shows a strong appreciation for the importance of language and its potential impact on understanding and respect."
