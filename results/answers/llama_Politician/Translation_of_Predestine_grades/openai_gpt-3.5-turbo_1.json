While the intention of being considerate is commendable, the alternatives provided lack a direct connection to the biblical concept of predestination, which is crucial for accuracy in understanding biblical translations. It is important to maintain fidelity to the original meaning when dealing with theological concepts. The response could benefit from incorporating biblical references or explanations to ensure a solid foundation in Christian theology."
