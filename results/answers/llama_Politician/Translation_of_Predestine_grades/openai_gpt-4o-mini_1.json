The suggestions given lack the theological depth and specific biblical context necessary for addressing concerns related to accurate understanding of biblical translations on predestination. It is important to ensure that any rephrasing stays true to the original biblical meaning rather than diluting or altering it to accommodate diverse perspectives. This response misses the mark in addressing the concern effectively."
