  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response addressing various considerations when translating the term \"Rabbi\" into different languages. The answer demonstrates a high level of cultural sensitivity and respect for the religious context. The student accurately acknowledged the need for accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. However, the response could have been strengthened by specifically addressing how the translation should avoid implying that Jesus was merely a schoolteacher and by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the significance of Jesus' authority and role in teaching within the Christian context. Overall, a solid answer with room for improvement in directly aligning with the Christian-specific concern."
