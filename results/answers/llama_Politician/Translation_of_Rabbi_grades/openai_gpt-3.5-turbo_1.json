  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response addresses the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith by emphasizing the importance of respecting the significance of the title \"Rabbi\" and avoiding implications that Jesus was merely a schoolteacher. The recommendations provided for translating the term into other languages demonstrate a thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach. The response also aligns well with a Christian worldview by highlighting the need to maintain the reverence and authenticity of Jesus' teaching role in the translation process."
