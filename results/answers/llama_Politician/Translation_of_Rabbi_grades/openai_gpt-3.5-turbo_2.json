  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and thoughtful approach to translating the title \"Rabbi\" while respecting its significance and ensuring accuracy in representing Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith. The considerations for consultation, contextual understanding, nuanced translation, cultural sensitivity, bilingual support, historical perspective, and localized relevance are well-addressed. The examples of translated titles in different languages further demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the topic. However, the response could be improved by explicitly connecting these considerations to the concern of accurately representing Jesus' teaching role within the Christian faith throughout the entire response."
