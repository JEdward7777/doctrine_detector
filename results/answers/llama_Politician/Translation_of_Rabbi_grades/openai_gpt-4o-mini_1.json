  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and thoughtful approach to translating the title \"Rabbi\" into different languages while respecting its significance and addressing concerns about accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The suggested translation strategies demonstrate a deep understanding of both cultural sensitivity and religious context. The only minor suggestion for improvement could be to explicitly tie the translation of \"Rabbi\" back to Jesus as the ultimate teacher within the Christian faith, to further strengthen the connection to the concern at hand. Overall, an excellent response that effectively combines linguistic considerations with a Christian worldview."
