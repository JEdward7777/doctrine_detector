  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides thorough and thoughtful considerations for translating the title of \"Rabbi\" while respecting its religious significance and cultural context. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining accuracy and respect in translation, which aligns well with ensuring the accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The suggestions for consultation, contextual understanding, nuanced translation, cultural sensitivity, bilingual support, historical perspective, and localized relevance are all relevant and well-addressed. Deductions could be made for the lack of explicit connection to Jesus as Rabbi in the response, as well as the absence of a direct reference to how teachers are typically addressed in the target language as per the given concern."
