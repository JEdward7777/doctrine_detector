The response provides insightful considerations for translating the term \"ransom\" in different languages, but it lacks a clear connection to the theological implications of this term and how it should be accurately communicated across cultures from a Christian perspective. More emphasis on the theological significance of the term \"ransom\" and how it relates to concepts like redemption and atonement would strengthen the response in addressing the specified concern."
