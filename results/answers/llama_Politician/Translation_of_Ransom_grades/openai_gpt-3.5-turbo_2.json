However, the answer primarily focuses on cultural and linguistic sensitivity rather than ensuring accurate understanding of theological terms. While the approach is commendable, more emphasis on accurately conveying the theological implications of the term \"ransom\" within various cultural contexts would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
