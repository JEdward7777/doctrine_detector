  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of linguistic and cultural nuances in translation, it falls short in accurately addressing the concern of ensuring theological terms are understood across different contexts. The focus on cultural sensitivity and historical baggage, while important, does not directly ensure the theological accuracy of the translation of the term \"ransom.\" The response should have centered more on capturing the theological implications of redemption, sacrifice, and liberation that are inherent in the term \"ransom.\" Therefore, a higher grade could have been achieved by aligning the discussion more closely with ensuring theological fidelity in translation."
