  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, showing sensitivity to cultural nuances. However, the concern specifically mentions the context of biblical teachings, which emphasize humility, honoring authority, and respecting titles. The teacher's reference answer highlights the importance of using a natural and appropriate way of addressing a ruler in the target language, without overly formal or exaggerated expressions. While the student's answer is informative and well-researched, it lacks a direct connection to biblical teachings regarding titles and respect for authority. To improve, the student could have included biblical references or principles on addressing authority figures respectfully in various cultures."
