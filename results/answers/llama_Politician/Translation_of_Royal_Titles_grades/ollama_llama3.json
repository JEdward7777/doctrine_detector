The response's focus on inclusivity and avoiding unintentionally offending individuals or groups is also appreciated.\n\nHowever, to better align with the concern, the response could have provided more explicit connections between the linguistic expressions and biblical teachings. For example, it could have discussed how using respectful titles such as \"Your Majesty\" reflects God's dignity and authority, or how understanding different cultural expressions of respect can help us better honor those in positions of authority (e.g., 1 Timothy 2:1-2)."
