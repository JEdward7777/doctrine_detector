  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides a thorough list of potential translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, it falls short in the context of biblical teachings. The concern of accurately and respectfully translating titles in accordance with biblical principles is not directly addressed in the response. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to consider principles of humility, honor, and respect as exemplified in the Bible when addressing rulers. The response lacks a discussion on applying biblical teachings to the translation of royal titles, which is a significant gap in evaluating translations from a Christian perspective."
