  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of potential translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, taking into consideration cultural nuances and contexts. However, there is a lack of direct connection to biblical teachings or a Christian worldview in the explanations provided. To improve the grade, the response could have incorporated biblical principles related to honoring authority figures or rulers, and how such translations align with Christian values of respect and humility."
