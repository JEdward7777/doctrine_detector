  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides a thorough list of potential translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages and acknowledges the importance of cultural sensitivity, it falls short of addressing the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings. The response does not integrate biblical principles or teachings related to addressing rulers and authorities, which is essential when discussing titles and honorifics within a Christian worldview. Incorporating relevant biblical insights would have strengthened the response and aligned it more closely with the specified concern."
