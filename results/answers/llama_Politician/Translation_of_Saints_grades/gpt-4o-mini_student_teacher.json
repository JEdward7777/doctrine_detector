  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and respectful response, considering different religious traditions and contexts when translating the term \"saints.\" While their suggestions were comprehensive, the focus should have been on providing translations that accurately represent all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups, as per the specified concern. The student's response was well-reasoned and demonstrated an understanding of the importance of sensitivity in discussing religious concepts."
