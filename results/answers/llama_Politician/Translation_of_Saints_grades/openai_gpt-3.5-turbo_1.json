  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides thoughtful and inclusive suggestions for translating the term \"saints\" in various religious and cultural contexts. While it addresses the concern by offering alternatives like \"holy ones\" and \"holy people,\" it still references \"believers in Jesus,\" which may not be completely inclusive of all individuals from different Christian groups. The response demonstrates sensitivity and understanding but could further enhance inclusivity by avoiding specific religious references."
