The suggested options demonstrate an understanding of different religious and cultural contexts, offering nuanced translations that consider various beliefs and practices. The response could be improved by further elaborating on how to ensure accurate representation of all believers in Jesus without unintentionally excluding any specific Christian groups. Overall, it shows a commendable effort to approach translation with sensitivity and inclusivity."
