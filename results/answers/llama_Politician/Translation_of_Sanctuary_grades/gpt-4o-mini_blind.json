The emphasis on using inclusive language and consulting with experts is commendable. However, the answer lacks specific guidance from a Christian worldview, which is essential when discussing terms with religious significance like \"sanctuary.\" Incorporating insights on the biblical understanding of sanctuary and its significance in Christian theology would have strengthened the response. Overall, while the response addresses important considerations, it falls short of providing a fully Christian-specific perspective on the topic."
