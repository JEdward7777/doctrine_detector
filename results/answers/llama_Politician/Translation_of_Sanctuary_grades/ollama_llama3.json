While it acknowledges the importance of considering context, cultural competence, and inclusivity when translating \"sanctuary,\" it does not specifically focus on maintaining the original Biblical definition.\n\nThe provided answer is also not fully addressed in this response, as it primarily discusses avoiding references to a worship room in a modern-day church rather than ensuring that the term accurately reflects its Biblical definition. The response could benefit from a more direct and nuanced approach to understanding and translating \"sanctuary\" while maintaining its original Biblical meaning.\n\nTo improve this response, the author should provide a more detailed explanation of how they would ensure the proper translation and understanding of the term \"sanctuary\" while considering its Biblical definition and context."
