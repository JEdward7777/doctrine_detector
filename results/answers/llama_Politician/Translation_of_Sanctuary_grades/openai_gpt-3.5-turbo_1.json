  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to translating the term \"sanctuary\" in modern texts by considering the broader cultural and social context, using inclusive language, and consulting with experts. The focus on cultural competence, sensitivity, and inclusivity aligns well with Christian values of respecting the original biblical meaning of terms. The response could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the translation process to maintaining the original Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place. Overall, a strong effort is made to address the concern while incorporating Christian worldview principles."
