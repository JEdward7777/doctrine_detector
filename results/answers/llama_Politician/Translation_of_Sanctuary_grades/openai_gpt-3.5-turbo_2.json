The emphasis on consulting experts and considering the broader context is commendable. However, the response could have more directly addressed the concern of maintaining the original Biblical meaning of the term \"sanctuary\" to align with a Christian worldview. Additionally, incorporating more explicit references to Biblical definitions and principles related to sanctuary would have strengthened the connection to the concern. Overall, a solid response with room for further integration of Christian-specific perspectives."
