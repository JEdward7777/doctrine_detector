  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and respectful response to the question, acknowledging the implications of translating the term \"Savior\" and emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and cultural sensitivity. However, there was a lack of doctrinal depth and specificity in discussing the Christian understanding of God's role as Savior. The response could be improved by incorporating more Scriptural references and doctrinal teachings to enhance the theological depth of the analysis."
