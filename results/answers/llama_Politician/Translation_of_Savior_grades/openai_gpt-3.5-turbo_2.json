  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response engages well with the concern of how language shapes theological understanding and faith practices by discussing the implications of translating the term \"Savior.\" It effectively acknowledges the nuances of different cultural and religious contexts while emphasizing the redemptive nature of God. The inclusion of a call for inclusivity and respect for diverse faith traditions adds depth to the response. Overall, a thoughtful and well-rounded reflection that aligns with a Christian worldview."
