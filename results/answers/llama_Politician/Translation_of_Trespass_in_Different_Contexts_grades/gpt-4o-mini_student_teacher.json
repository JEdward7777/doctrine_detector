  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student made a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating \"trespass\" as \"sin\" or \"breaking the rule\" within a church community. The response demonstrated a consideration of diverse perspectives and emphasized empathy and understanding. However, the student's answer lacked direct alignment with the reference answer provided by the teacher, which clearly highlighted the spiritual consequences and community harmony aspect. The student's response could have been improved by focusing more on the specific implications mentioned in the reference answer."
