  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks depth and does not adequately address the concern of ensuring accurate translations convey the meaning and importance of worship spaces. While the student emphasizes inclusivity and modern language, their suggestions of \"place of worship\" or \"spiritual sanctuary\" do not fully capture the significance of the original phrase 'house of Yahweh'. The reference answer provides a more specific and meaningful translation that aligns with the concern stated. The student's response, while well-intentioned, falls short in providing a suitable translation for understanding the importance of worship spaces within a Christian worldview."
