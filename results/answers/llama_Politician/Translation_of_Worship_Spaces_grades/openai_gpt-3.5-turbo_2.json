The suggested translation options lacked a direct connection to the divine presence of Yahweh in the worship space, which is crucial in Christian theology. Additionally, the emphasis on ecumenical language and inclusivity, while important in certain contexts, should not compromise the specific theological significance conveyed in sacred texts. It is essential to prioritize faithfulness to the original meaning and theological nuances in Christian translations."
