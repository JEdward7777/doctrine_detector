The Christian worldview values the reverence and specificity of divine names and attributes, so it is essential to maintain the focus on Yahweh in translations related to worship spaces. The response also lacks a clear connection to the theological implications of worshiping in Yahweh's presence, which is crucial in understanding the sanctity of worship spaces in Christianity."
