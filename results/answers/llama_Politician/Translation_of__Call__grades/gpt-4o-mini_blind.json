The suggested alternative translations consider different nuances and implications, which is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it is important to prioritize doctrinal accuracy and faithfulness to the original text over modern cultural sensitivities. The focus on avoiding patriarchal connotations and gender-specific pronouns may deviate from the intended meaning of the biblical text. While inclusivity and respectful language are important, it is crucial to ensure that the essence and theological message of the original Scripture are preserved in any translation or interpretation."
