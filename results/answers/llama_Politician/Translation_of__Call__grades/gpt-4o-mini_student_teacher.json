  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 70.\n\nThe student demonstrated a thoughtful approach to the question by offering alternative translations that consider cultural nuances and linguistic sensitivities. They provided creative and inclusive rephrasings of the original phrase, showing sensitivity to gender-related concerns. However, the student's answer strayed slightly from directly addressing the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation. While their suggestions were well-thought-out, the focus could have been more closely tied to the specific context of biblical translation.\n\nOverall, the student showed a good understanding of the importance of respect and consideration in language use, but could have strengthened the connection to the nuances of biblical language and interpretation for a higher grade."
