# Answer by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
When approaching sacred texts, it's essential to be mindful of the cultural nuances and linguistic sensitivities that may have been present at the time of writing.

In a biblical context, the phrase "You must call his name" could be rephrased to:

1. "Name him accordingly": This translation maintains the original intent while avoiding any perceived patriarchal connotations.
2. "Give him this identity": This alternative emphasizes the significance of the naming process without referencing gender-specific pronouns.
3. "Affix a title or designation": This phrasing focuses on the act of assigning a name rather than emphasizing the individual's identity, which may be more inclusive for some readers.
4. "Designate his existence": This translation takes a more abstract approach, highlighting the importance of acknowledging and recording one's existence without drawing attention to gendered aspects.

By presenting alternative translations, we can facilitate a more diverse range of understandings and foster a sense of inclusivity in our interpretation of sacred texts.

Now, I must emphasize that these suggestions are not meant to be taken as definitive or authoritative. Rather, they represent my attempt to engage in respectful and considerate language, acknowledging the complexities and sensitivities surrounding biblical scholarship.
