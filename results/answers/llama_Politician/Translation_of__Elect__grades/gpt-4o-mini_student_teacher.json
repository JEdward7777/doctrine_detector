  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written and thoughtful response in addressing the differences in translation of the term \"elect\" between older and modern English Bible versions. The answer is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of the issue at hand. However, the student's answer does not directly address the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to the concept of being chosen by God, as specified in the given concern. The response focuses more on the linguistic differences in translation and the potential implications without delving into the theological significance of being chosen by God. The student could improve by directly connecting the translation differences to the theological concept of election in the Christian faith."
