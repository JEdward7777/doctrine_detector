The inclusion of various translations and their nuances enriches the analysis. However, the response could further emphasize the biblical concept of being chosen by God from a Christian worldview perspective and provide a more explicit connection to how these translation differences impact the understanding of God's sovereignty and the believer's identity in Christ."
