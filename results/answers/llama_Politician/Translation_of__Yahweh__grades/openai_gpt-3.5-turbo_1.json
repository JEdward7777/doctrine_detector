It demonstrates respect for both the original names of God in Hebrew and the cultural practices within Christianity. However, it could have more explicitly emphasized the importance of maintaining reverence for the sacred name of Yahweh while also being sensitive to different faith traditions, which is crucial from a Christian worldview."
