It acknowledges the distinction between worshiping God and worshiping false gods, using the example of the Canaanites and Israelites. However, the response also promotes inclusivity and diversity of beliefs, which could be seen as potentially diluting the exclusive nature of Christian worship. It's important for Christians to uphold the truth of God's sovereignty and uniqueness, while still showing respect and understanding towards others."
