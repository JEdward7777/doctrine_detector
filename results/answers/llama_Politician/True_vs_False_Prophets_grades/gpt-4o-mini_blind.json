  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response addresses the question with some attempts at inclusivity and sensitivity, which are positive aspects. However, the answer falls short in its doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. The response lacks a clear focus on Biblical criteria for evaluating prophets, such as Deuteronomy 18:20-22 which mentions the need for prophecies to be accurate. Additionally, it emphasizes subjective criteria like personal values and moral character over the authority of scripture. It's important for the student to strengthen the theological foundations of their argument and prioritize Biblical standards over cultural relativism in addressing this topic."
