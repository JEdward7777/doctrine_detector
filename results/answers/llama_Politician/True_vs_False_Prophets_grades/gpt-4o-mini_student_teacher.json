  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of various criteria for discerning true prophets from false ones. However, the student's answer lacks a clear and direct focus on examining if the prophet's messages align with God's Word, the nature of their teachings, and the fruits of their ministry, as highlighted in the reference answer. While the student's answer addresses important aspects such as alignment with core values, consistency with scripture or tradition, moral character, verifiable predictions, and evaluation by authorities, it could be more concise and specifically emphasize the crucial factors mentioned in the reference answer. The response would benefit from a clearer alignment with a Christian specific worldview in addressing the concern stated."
