  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and respectful exploration of criteria for discerning true prophets from false ones, encompassing various aspects such as aligning with core values, consistency with scripture, moral character, verifiable prophecies, and evaluation by trusted authorities. However, it falls slightly short of directly addressing the concern of discerning true prophetic voices from misleading ones as specified in the answer provided. While the response offers valuable insights and considerations from a general religious perspective, it could have been more explicitly tied back to the Christian worldview and the authority of God's Word in discerning true prophetic voices within a Christian context."
