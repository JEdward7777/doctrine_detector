The inclusion of respect for religious diversity and tolerance is commendable. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the ultimate authority of God's Word as the primary standard for evaluating prophetic messages within a Christian worldview. Integrating a clearer focus on the supremacy of Scripture and the leading of the Holy Spirit would enhance the Christian-specific perspective on discerning true prophets."
