The response emphasizes values, consistency with tradition, moral character, verifiable predictions, and evaluation by authorities, but it does not strongly underscore the necessity of aligning messages with God's Word as the primary criterion. This omission detracts from the clarity and authority that a Christian worldview would place on scripture as the foundation for discerning true prophetic voices."
