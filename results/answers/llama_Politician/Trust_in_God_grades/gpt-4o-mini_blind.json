However, the response lacked a clear emphasis on the foundational Christian belief that hope in God is rooted in the promises and character of God as revealed in Scripture. The answer also seemed to prioritize inclusivity and respect for various beliefs over presenting a clear and distinct Christian perspective. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to strengthen the doctrinal foundation and explicitly tie in Christian teachings on hope in God for a more complete and accurate understanding."
