  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and demonstrates an understanding of the difference between hope in God and mere wishing. However, the student's answer falls short of fully addressing the concern given. While they touched on the idea of trust and faith in a higher power, they did not emphasize the crucial aspect of confident expectation in God's faithfulness and fulfillment of promises that distinguishes hope from wishful thinking according to the Christian worldview. The student also placed a strong emphasis on tolerance of diverse beliefs, which is commendable but somewhat detracts from focusing on the specific Christian perspective being considered."
