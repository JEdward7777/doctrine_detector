  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response does a great job of distinguishing between hope in God and mere wishing, highlighting the importance of trust, faith, and dependence on a higher power in having genuine hope. The writer also acknowledges that not everyone shares their perspective, which shows respect for different beliefs and orientations.\n\nThe only area where this response could improve is in its directness and clarity regarding the concern. While the writer does touch on the nuance between hoping in God versus mere wishing, they could have explicitly stated that having hope in God involves a confident trust in God's faithfulness and promises, as per the given answer. Additionally, some readers might appreciate more concrete examples or Scripture references to further illustrate this distinction.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a thoughtful and respectful exploration of the concern, making it a strong 85!"
