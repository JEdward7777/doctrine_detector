  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out response on demonstrating trustworthiness according to Biblical principles. However, there are some areas that could be improved. The response could have delved deeper into the concept of trustworthiness from a Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of aligning one's actions with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Additionally, the language used could have been more direct and explicitly rooted in biblical citations to strengthen the doctrinal foundation of the response. Overall, a good effort, but there is room for enhancement in aligning more closely with scriptural teachings."
