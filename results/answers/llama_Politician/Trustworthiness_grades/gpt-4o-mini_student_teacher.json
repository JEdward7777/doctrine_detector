  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful response to the question, outlining practical ways to demonstrate trustworthiness according to Biblical principles. However, there was a lack of direct reference to the simple and clear definition of trustworthiness provided in the teacher's answer. While the student's suggestions align well with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability, the response could have been strengthened by directly incorporating the teacher's reference answer to show a more precise connection to Biblical principles."
