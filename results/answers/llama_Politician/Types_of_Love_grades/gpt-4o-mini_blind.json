  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This answer demonstrates a good understanding of the various forms of love within a biblical context and provides solid scriptural references to support the discussion. The student effectively connects the characteristics of love outlined in 1 Corinthians 13 to brotherly love (agape) and romantic love, emphasizing the sacrificial nature inherent in both. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into how each form of love is interconnected and how they ultimately reflect God's nature. Additionally, a more explicit tie-in to the unique role of Christ in exemplifying and enabling these forms of love would have enhanced the theological depth of the answer. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
