  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-articulated response that aligns closely with the biblical principles of love. They effectively incorporated relevant Bible verses and teachings into their explanation of brotherly love (agape) and romantic love, emphasizing the selfless and sacrificial nature of love as demonstrated by Jesus. The inclusion of specific references and analysis of Biblical passages enhances the depth of their answer. However, there could have been a more direct connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher, which would have further solidified the alignment with a Christian worldview. Overall, a commendable response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
