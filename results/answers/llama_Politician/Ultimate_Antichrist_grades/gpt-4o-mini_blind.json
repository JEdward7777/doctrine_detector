The Book of Revelation does indeed present various figures, but the ultimate Antichrist is typically understood in Christian theology to be an eschatological figure who embodies the epitome of evil and opposition to God, traditionally identified as an individual empowered by Satan. The answer could have been improved by clearly stating this belief while still maintaining a respectful tone towards differing interpretations."
