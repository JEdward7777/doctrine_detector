However, the answer lacks a clear assertion or identification of who is often identified as the ultimate antichrist in the book. It is important for Christians to be grounded in their beliefs and understand the specific figure traditionally associated with the ultimate antichrist in the context of the Book of Revelation for proper preparation in faith."
