However, the student's emphasis on avoiding offensive language, while important in a political context, somewhat detracts from the opportunity to discuss how awareness of eschatological figures in Revelation can actually benefit Christians in preparing for challenges they may face in their faith. Encouraging a deeper exploration of the significance of recognizing and understanding these figures from a Christian perspective would have enhanced the response."
