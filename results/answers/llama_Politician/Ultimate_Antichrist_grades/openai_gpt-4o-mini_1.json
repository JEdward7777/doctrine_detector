However, it may have benefitted from explicitly connecting the identified antichrist figure with the need for Christians to prepare for challenges in their faith. Additionally, while the response emphasizes tolerance and inclusivity, it could have underscored the ultimate victory of Jesus over evil as a central Christian belief in the context of eschatology."
