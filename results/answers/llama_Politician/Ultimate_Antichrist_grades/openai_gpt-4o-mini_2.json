However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern about the importance of understanding eschatological figures for Christians to prepare for challenges in their faith. It emphasizes inclusivity and tolerance without emphasizing the need for biblical discernment and spiritual readiness in facing evil. An improved response would integrate the importance of recognizing eschatological figures as a tool for spiritual growth and discernment in the face of spiritual battles."
