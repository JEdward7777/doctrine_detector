The analogy used of a \"global, cosmic family reunion\" and a \"magnificent tapestry\" may lead to misunderstanding or misconceptions about the biblical concept of adoption as children of God. The emphasis should have been on our adoption into God's family through Jesus Christ, our status as heirs, and the spiritual implications of this relationship. More focus on the text of Ephesians 1:5 and biblical context would have strengthened the response."
