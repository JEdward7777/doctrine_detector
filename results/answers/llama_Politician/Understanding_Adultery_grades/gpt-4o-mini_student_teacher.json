  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided an overview of the biblical perspective on adultery, their focus on being respectful, compassionate, and inclusive detracted from directly addressing the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality as per the concern stated. The student failed to emphasize the spiritual and relational consequences of adultery, as outlined in the reference answer. Instead, their response leaned more towards promoting understanding and empathy, neglecting the severity and consequences of adultery as depicted in the Bible."
