  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the universal use of \"amen\" and promotes inclusivity, it fails to address the specific significance of prayer in Christian practice. The explanation provided lacks depth and insight into the Christian worldview regarding prayer, which is essential when discussing the use of \"amen\" in that context. Overall, the response could benefit from a more thorough understanding and incorporation of Christian beliefs and teachings on prayer."
