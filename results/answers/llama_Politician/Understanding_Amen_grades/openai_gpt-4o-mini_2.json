However, the concern is about understanding the significance of prayer in Christian practice specifically, and this response does not delve deeply into the Christian perspective on the meaning and importance of saying \"amen\" in the context of Christian faith. It would have been stronger if it had provided a more detailed explanation from a Christian worldview."
