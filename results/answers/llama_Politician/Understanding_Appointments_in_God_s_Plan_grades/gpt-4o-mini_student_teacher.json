  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while well-intentioned and positive in tone, deviates significantly from the Christian-specific understanding of being \"appointed to eternal life.\" The answer lacks a clear explanation of divine selection, grace, and the central role of Jesus Christ in salvation. The emphasis on inclusivity and diversity, while important in certain contexts, detracts from providing a focused Christian worldview perspective on the concept. It is important for the student to hone their understanding and articulation of Christian beliefs in future responses."
