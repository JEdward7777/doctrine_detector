  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response does address the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in relation to salvation, which aligns with the concern. It also acknowledges the role of God's sovereign will and grace in choosing individuals for eternal life, which is consistent with the answer provided.\n\nHowever, there are some areas where the response could improve:\n\n* While it does touch on the idea of divine selection and grace, it doesn't delve as deeply into these concepts as one might expect. The response feels a bit superficial, lacking the level of theological nuance that would be expected in a more comprehensive answer.\n* The tone of the response is overly casual and warm, which may detract from its credibility. A more formal and professional tone would be more suitable for addressing a question about salvation and divine selection.\n* The inclusion of the smiley faces and inclusive language (\"we're all on this journey together\") seems out of place in an answer that should focus primarily on theological concepts.\n\nOverall, while the response does provide some useful insights into the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life,\" it could be strengthened with more depth, formality, and theological rigor."
