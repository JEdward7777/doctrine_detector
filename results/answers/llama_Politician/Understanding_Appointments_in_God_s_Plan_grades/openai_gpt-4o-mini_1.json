  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response attempts to address the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" and emphasizes the idea of divine selection and grace, it falls short of providing a clear and concise explanation. The response meanders through various tangents and fails to directly engage with the specific concern provided. Additionally, there is a lack of depth in theological analysis and integration of a Christian worldview perspective. Improvement is needed in focusing on the central theological theme and providing a more structured and insightful response."
