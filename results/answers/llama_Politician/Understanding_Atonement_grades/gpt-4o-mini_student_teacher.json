  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student shows respect and sensitivity towards various religious beliefs, the answer lacks a clear understanding of the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology. The student's response does not explicitly address the significance of Christ's death as the permanent atonement for sin according to Christian belief. The focus on interfaith dialogue and universal values, while important, detracts from the core Christian doctrine being discussed. Encouraging empathy and mutual respect is valuable, but a deeper exploration of the unique theological implications of Christ's sacrifice within Christianity is needed for a higher grade."
