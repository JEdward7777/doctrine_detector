  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a commendable effort to approach the topic with sensitivity and respect for different religious beliefs. The candidate acknowledges the significance of Christ's death within Christian theology and attempts to relate it to universal values of love, compassion, and forgiveness. However, while the candidate emphasizes the importance of interfaith dialogue and mutual respect, they do not fully grasp the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology. A deeper understanding of the unique role of Christ's death as the ultimate sacrifice for atonement and reconciliation with God is needed to fully address the concern raised."
