The candidate does acknowledge the significance of Christ's death and attempts to draw connections to universal values, but there is a lack of depth in discussing the theological implications of atonement and reconciliation through Christ's sacrifice. Encouraging interfaith dialogue and mutual respect is commendable, but a more thorough exploration of the unique Christian perspective on the sacrificial death of Jesus would have strengthened the response."
