  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed and well-thought-out response regarding the significance of names in biblical culture and the practice of naming in the Bible, they veer away from the direct answer to the question. The student does not clearly state that the phrase \"His name is called John\" simply means that the person is referred to as John. Although the additional context and insights are appreciated, the answer lacks the directness required for proper biblical interpretation."
