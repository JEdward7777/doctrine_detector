However, there are several areas where the theological understanding could be strengthened. The response could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the spiritual significance of the birthright in biblical context and the consequences of Esau's actions from a doctrinal perspective. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references and theological insights would enhance the depth of analysis. Despite the lack of doctrinal depth, the response demonstrates a thoughtful exploration of the subject matter."
