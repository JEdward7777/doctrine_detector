  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-articulated analysis of the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob, showcasing an understanding of the complexities within sibling relationships as portrayed in the biblical account. The response effectively highlights the differing outcomes for both brothers and acknowledges the nuances of their actions. However, the student could have strengthened the answer by directly addressing the spiritual consequences of Esau's choice within a Christian context, emphasizing the importance of honoring God's order and the consequences of hasty decisions in biblical narratives. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper exploration of Christian themes."
