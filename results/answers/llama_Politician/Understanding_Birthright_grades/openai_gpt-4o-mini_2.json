  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the biblical account of Esau and Jacob and acknowledges the spiritual consequences of Esau's choice to sell his birthright. The student effectively integrates the significance of choices and their impact on spiritual aspects within a Christian worldview. There is a clear understanding of the biblical context and implications of the story. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Esau and Jacob's actions to further emphasize the spiritual lessons."
