The response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of these concepts in the Bible and their relevance for Christians today. It also could have emphasized the importance of Jesus Christ's fulfillment of the law and how His sacrifice on the cross impacts our understanding of moral purity. Further exploration of how the Old Testament laws point to the need for a Savior and the New Testament's teachings on purity and holiness would have strengthened the response."
