  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student did a commendable job in exploring the ancient biblical concepts of \"clean\" and \"unclean\" and linking them to moral purity. They demonstrated an understanding of the cultural and religious context of these concepts in ancient Israel. The response shows thoughtfulness and respect for diverse perspectives, although it briefly missed emphasizing the symbolic nature of moral purity in relation to being set apart for God's service, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the student's insights and efforts in discussing the complexities of moral purity in today's pluralistic society are commendable."
