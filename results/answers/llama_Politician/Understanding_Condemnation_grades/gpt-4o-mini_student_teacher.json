  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a **50**.\n\nWhile the student tried to address the nature of condemnation as referenced in 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16, their response lacked depth and clarity. The student should have focused more on the contrast between condemnation and grace in the Christian life, as the concern specified. The answer also missed the crucial point that through Christ, believers are freed from condemnation. However, the student did attempt to touch on important concepts such as sin, righteousness by faith, and reconciliation to God through Jesus Christ. Overall, the answer could have been improved by providing a more direct and clearer explanation based on the given Bible verses."
