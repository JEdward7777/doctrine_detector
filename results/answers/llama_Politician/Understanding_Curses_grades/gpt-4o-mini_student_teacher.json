  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student shows a good understanding of the importance of controlling one's tongue and refraining from cursing others based on the Biblical passage cited. However, the response is lengthy and at times veers off into general advice on using words wisely rather than specifically focusing on the consequences of cursing others as per the concern provided. Encouraging the student to provide a more direct and focused explanation in alignment with the specific concern raised would enhance the clarity and relevance of the response."
