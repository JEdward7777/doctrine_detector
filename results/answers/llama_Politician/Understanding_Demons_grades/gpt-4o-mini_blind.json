  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student shows a level of sensitivity and inclusivity in their response, the grading is primarily based on doctrinal correctness within Christian teachings. The response lacks substantial depth in explaining the significance of \"unclean spirits\" in relation to demons according to Christian beliefs. The emphasis on cultural context, inclusivity, and diversity, although important, should not overshadow the core doctrinal understanding of the term in a Christian worldview. A more in-depth explanation of the biblical understanding of unclean spirits and their role in Christian teachings would greatly improve the response."
