  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response an 60. \n\nWhile the student attempts to provide an explanation of \"unclean spirits\" in Christian teachings, there are concerns from a Christian worldview. The student's response lacks depth and clarity in explaining the true nature and characteristics of demons as understood in Christian teachings. The student's emphasis on inclusivity and diversity, while important, detracts from the specific Christian understanding of demons as malevolent entities that oppose God's will. The response could have been improved by focusing on biblical references and theological understanding of demons within the Christian context."
