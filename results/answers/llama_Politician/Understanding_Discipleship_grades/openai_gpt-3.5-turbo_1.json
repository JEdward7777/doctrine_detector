However, there is a lack of clear emphasis on the responsibility aspect of being a disciple and the need for personal commitment and obedience. While the response touches on spreading love, kindness, and acceptance, it could have been stronger in emphasizing the importance of personal faith and obedience to Jesus' teachings."
