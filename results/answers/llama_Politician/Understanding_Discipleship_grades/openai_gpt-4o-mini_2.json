  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the definition and responsibilities of being a disciple of Jesus by emphasizing the importance of believing in Him, obeying His teachings, and following His example. However, there is a concern that the response also includes elements that may dilute the focus on this definition, such as emphasizing inclusivity and broad interpretations. While inclusivity is important, it should not overshadow the core beliefs and responsibilities associated with being a disciple."
