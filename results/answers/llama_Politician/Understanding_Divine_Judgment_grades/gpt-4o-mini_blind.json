  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The response lacks doctrinal correctness, as it focuses more on promoting tolerance and inclusivity rather than presenting a biblically accurate depiction of God's judgment. While sensitivity is important, it should not come at the expense of watering down or misrepresenting Christian teachings. The student's answer fails to emphasize the biblical concepts of sin, repentance, and faith in Christ as crucial elements in understanding God's judgment. Additionally, human judgment is not solely characterized by personal biases and cultural norms but is also affected by the fallen nature of humanity and its separation from divine wisdom. The student's response, though well-intentioned in advocating for empathy and respect, deviates significantly from the core tenets of Christian theology on God's judgment."
