  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a general overview of God's judgment and human judgment, but it lacks depth and specificity in comparing the two. The student correctly emphasizes God's perfect righteousness and justice, but the answer would benefit from directly addressing the distinction between God's judgment and flawed human judgment as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, while the student talks about promoting empathy and understanding, there is a lack of emphasis on the fundamental differences between God's judgment and human judgment from a Christian worldview perspective."
