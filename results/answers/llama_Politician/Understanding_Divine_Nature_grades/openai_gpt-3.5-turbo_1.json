However, there is a lack of emphasis on the significance of developing a personal relationship with God and living according to His will from a Christian worldview perspective. While the response promotes respect for diverse beliefs, it falls short in highlighting the unique and foundational role of Jesus Christ in understanding and approaching God's divine nature as a Christian."
