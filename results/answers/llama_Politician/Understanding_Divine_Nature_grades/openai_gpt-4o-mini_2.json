However, the response also veers into relativism by emphasizing the diverse interpretations of God's nature across different belief systems. While acknowledging different perspectives is important, it is essential to uphold the truth of God's essential attributes as defined in a Christian worldview. The response could have provided a clearer affirmation of the Christian perspective on God's divine nature while still respecting differences in interpretation."
