However, the answer lacked specificity in addressing the concern about the importance of understanding how to attain eternal life in Christianity. The response could have delved deeper into the biblical teachings on obedience to God's laws and faith in Him as the means to inheriting eternal life, aligning more closely with the Christian worldview."
