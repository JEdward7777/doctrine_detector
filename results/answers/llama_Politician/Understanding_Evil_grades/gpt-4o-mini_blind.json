  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough and well-researched exploration of the distinctions between \"evil\" and \"wickedness\" in the Bible, drawing from both Hebrew and Greek texts. The explanation is clear and supported by relevant biblical references. The inclusion of the Old Testament and New Testament perspectives adds depth to the analysis. However, to enhance the doctrinal correctness, the student could have further emphasized the aspect of sin nature and the need for redemption through Christ in relation to the concepts of evil and wickedness. Overall, this is a commendable response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
