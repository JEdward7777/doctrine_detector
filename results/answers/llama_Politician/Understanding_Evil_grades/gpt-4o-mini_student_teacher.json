  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched analysis of the distinctions between \"evil\" and \"wickedness\" in the Bible, drawing from both Hebrew and Greek perspectives. The student demonstrated a deep understanding of the nuances within each term and how they relate to moral character and behavior. The answer effectively addressed the concern of ensuring clarity on the moral implications of behaviors and character in the context of biblical teachings. However, the response could have been slightly improved by more directly addressing the simplicity of the distinction as presented in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
