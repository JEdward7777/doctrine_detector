However, while the response delves into broader concepts of faith and spirituality, it somewhat dilutes the foundational aspect of faith in Christianity, which is centered on trusting in Jesus and His sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. The focus on inclusivity is positive, but it could have been balanced better with a clearer articulation of the core Christian belief being discussed."
