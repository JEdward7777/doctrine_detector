However, there is a significant dilution of the core Christian understanding of faith in Jesus by broadening the concept to encompass various spiritual beliefs. While sensitivity and inclusivity are important values, the response could have better emphasized the foundational aspect of faith in Christianity without compromising on respect for differing views."
