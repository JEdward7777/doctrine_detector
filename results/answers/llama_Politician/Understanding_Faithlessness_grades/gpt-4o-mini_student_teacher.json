  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful perspective on the term \"faithless\" by acknowledging that individuals who identify as such may still uphold moral values. However, the student's response falls short in aligning with the concern of highlighting the significance of faith in one's moral conduct. The reference answer emphasizes that the term 'faithless' is linked to immoral actions, which the student's answer did not directly address. Encouragement to provide a more explicit connection between faith, belief in God, and moral conduct in future responses."
