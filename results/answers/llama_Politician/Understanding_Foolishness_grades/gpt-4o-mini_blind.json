  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student's response, while attempting to be diplomatic and inclusive, falls short in accurately addressing the question from a Christian perspective. They failed to directly and unequivocally state the biblical definition of a fool as one who rejects wisdom and the fear of the Lord. The emphasis on inclusivity and avoiding judgment overshadowed the need to present the biblical truth clearly. Encouraging respectful dialogue is important, but the core message of biblical wisdom being essential was somewhat diluted in this response."
