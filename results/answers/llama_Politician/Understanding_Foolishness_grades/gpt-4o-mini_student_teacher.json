  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response lacks specificity and directness in addressing the question about the definition of a fool according to the Bible. While the student attempts to be inclusive and respectful of diverse beliefs, they do not directly address the biblical definition provided. The student's focus on inclusivity, while important, detracts from answering the question in a clear and concise manner. Encouragement to provide a more direct and specific response based on the Bible's definition would improve the grade."
