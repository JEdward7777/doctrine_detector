The inclusion of the uniqueness of forgiveness not excusing or justifying the wrong done is particularly insightful from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could have been further strengthened by referencing specific biblical teachings on forgiveness and the importance of forgiveness in relation to receiving God's forgiveness."
