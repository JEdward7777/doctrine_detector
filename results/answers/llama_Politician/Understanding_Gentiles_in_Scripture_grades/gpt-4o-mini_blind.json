  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments:\nThe answer provides a good overview of the complexities surrounding the Israelites' perception of Gentiles in the early church and acknowledges the historical context and theological nuances involved. The student effectively explores both the caution and wariness towards Gentiles stemming from the Israelites' background and the examples of bridge-building found in figures like Peter and Paul. However, there is room for improvement in tying the discussion more explicitly to Christian doctrine and scripture, emphasizing the importance of the gospel message and the inclusive nature of God's kingdom. Additionally, while the student's response is inclusive and respectful, it could have benefited from a clearer connection to the biblical teachings on unity in Christ and the call to spread the gospel to all nations."
