The inclusion of key biblical figures such as Peter and Paul, along with references to the book of Acts, provides a solid Christian perspective on the issue. The response also promotes a balanced approach that seeks to honor heritage while embracing diversity and reaching across cultural divides, aligning well with a Christian worldview."
