The issue of believers struggling with the implications of God's sovereignty is not directly acknowledged or addressed in the response. The focus on diversity and inclusivity, though important, does not directly engage with the Christian-specific concern provided. Encouraging unity and positive dialogue is commendable, but a deeper exploration of the theological and personal implications of God's sovereignty for believers would have been more appropriate in this context."
