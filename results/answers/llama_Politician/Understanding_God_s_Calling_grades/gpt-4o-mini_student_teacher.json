  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student's answer attempts to approach the topic with inclusivity and respect, they stray too far from the Christian-specific understanding of being \"called\" by God. The answer lacks a clear acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and direct involvement in the individual's purpose. Encouragingly, the student demonstrates a compassionate approach to discussing faith, but a stronger emphasis on the Christian theological perspective is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the concept of being \"called\" by God."
