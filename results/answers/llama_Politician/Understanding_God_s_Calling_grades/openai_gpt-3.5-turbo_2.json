The response should have emphasized the unique relationship Christians believe they have with God in discerning their personal purpose. It also could have provided a clearer distinction between a Christian understanding of being called by God and other views on spirituality. Overall, there is room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with a Christian-specific worldview."
