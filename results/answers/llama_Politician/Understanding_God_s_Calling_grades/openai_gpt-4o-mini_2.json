While it attempts to be inclusive of different perspectives, it dilutes the Christian understanding of being called by God by emphasizing the diversity of spiritual experiences without presenting a strong foundational Christian perspective. The response could have benefitted from a more thorough explanation of the Christian doctrine regarding divine calling and the integration of personal purpose within the framework of faith."
