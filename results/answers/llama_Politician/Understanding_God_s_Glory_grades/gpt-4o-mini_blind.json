The explanation is clear and the key differences are well articulated. However, the answer could be improved by strengthening the emphasis on the supreme nature of God's glory over worldly sources in terms of eternal significance and the importance of aligning our lives with His glory above all else. Also, the explanation could benefit from more scriptural references to support the points made. Overall, a solid response but room for deeper theological insight."
