  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the differences between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory. They highlight key distinctions in source, motivation, focus, duration, and impact, which is commendable. However, the answer lacks a clear emphasis on the unique and supreme nature of God's glory, as stated in the concern. The student could strengthen their response by more explicitly connecting the concept of God's glory to the immeasurable value, worth, and majesty described in the reference answer."
