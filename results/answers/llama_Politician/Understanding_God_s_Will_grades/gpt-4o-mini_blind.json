Additionally, there is a lack of clarity on the foundational role of God's revealed will through Scripture and the necessity of surrendering personal desires to God's sovereignty. These crucial aspects need to be highlighted for a more doctrinally accurate perspective. Additionally, the response could benefit from a stronger assertion of the uniqueness of Christian faith in understanding and seeking God's will in comparison to other worldviews."
