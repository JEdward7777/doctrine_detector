  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while eloquent and thoughtful, strays significantly from the Christian perspective provided in the reference answer. The student focuses more on personal beliefs, subjective experiences, and moral values rather than on aligning decisions with God's revealed will in Scripture. The response lacks a clear emphasis on seeking God's direction through prayer, Bible study, and obedience to His commands. Additionally, the student's mention of diversity of opinion and creating inclusive spaces may dilute the importance of aligning decisions with biblical principles. Overall, the answer falls short in providing a Christian-specific perspective on seeking God's will in everyday decisions."
