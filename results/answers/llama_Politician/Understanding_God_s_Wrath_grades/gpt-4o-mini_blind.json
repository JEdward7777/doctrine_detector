  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student's answer provides some understanding of the nature of God's wrath compared to human anger. They touch on important points such as God's wrath being a manifestation of His justice and holiness, as well as its universal nature. However, the response lacks depth and fails to delve deeply into the biblical teachings on God's wrath. Additionally, the attempt to lighten the discussion with quotes and light-hearted remarks diminishes the seriousness of the topic. The student could improve by providing more thorough biblical references and theological explanations of the differences between God's wrath and human anger."
