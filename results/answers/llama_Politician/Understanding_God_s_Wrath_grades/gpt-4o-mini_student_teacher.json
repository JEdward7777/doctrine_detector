  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of God's wrath as described in the Bible. They correctly emphasize the difference between God's wrath and human anger as being rooted in righteousness and justice. However, the response could have been more focused on directly addressing the concern provided, which highlighted the importance of understanding that God's wrath is a measured response and not a fit of rage. Additionally, there is some unnecessary commentary towards the end of the response that could have been omitted for greater clarity and conciseness. Overall, a solid effort but could benefit from a more direct engagement with the provided concern."
