  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing that God's wrath is not a fit of rage but a measured response to sin. It provides a detailed and thoughtful explanation supported by Biblical teachings, highlighting the distinction between God's wrath and human anger. The response maintains a respectful tone and incorporates the Christian worldview effectively. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the aspect of God's love being intertwined with His wrath, as well as a more direct reference to the Bible verses supporting these points."
