  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of God's wrath as a measured response to sin, in contrast to human anger. The writer effectively emphasizes the importance of approaching this topic with sensitivity and nuance, aligning with the concern provided. The response also incorporates biblical references to support the explanation. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the spiritual implications and consequences of God's wrath in relation to salvation and redemption, which would have further enhanced the Christian worldview perspective."
