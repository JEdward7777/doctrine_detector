The answer lacks a clear emphasis on the foundational truth that guilt stems from our separation from God due to sin. It also could have highlighted the necessity of repentance and acceptance of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sins. Furthermore, the answer tends to prioritize inclusivity and understanding over the biblical truth, which might dilute the significance of the message. Encouragement to seek unity should be grounded in the core biblical principles."
