  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated response that demonstrates a good understanding of the distinction between \"heaven\" and \"sky\" in biblical context. They incorporated relevant scripture references and explained the spiritual significance of each term effectively. However, the concern specifically highlighted the importance of understanding these terms in relation to God's nature and our relationship with Him, which the student could have delved into further to strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
