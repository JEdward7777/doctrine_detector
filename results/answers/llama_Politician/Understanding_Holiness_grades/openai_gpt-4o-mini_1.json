  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a deep and thoughtful exploration of God's absolute holiness in relation to human sinfulness and the implications for our relationship with Him. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the necessity of acknowledging our own sinfulness and the steps needed to approach a holy God. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly tie back the discussion to the original answer provided and perhaps offer more direct scriptural references to support the points made."
