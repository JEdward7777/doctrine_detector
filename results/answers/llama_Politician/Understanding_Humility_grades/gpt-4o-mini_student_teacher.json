  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer, while thoughtful and inclusive in its approach, strays from the Christian perspective on humility before God. The student focused more on a general understanding of humility that is not specifically tied to submitting to God's will and recognizing His greatness. While the student's answer promotes tolerance and inclusivity, it does not adequately address the Christian viewpoint on this topic. The student could benefit from delving deeper into the Christian teachings on humility before God to provide a more accurate and comprehensive response."
