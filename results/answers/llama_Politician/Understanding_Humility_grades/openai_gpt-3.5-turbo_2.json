  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and respectful exploration of humility before God from a Christian perspective. The candidate effectively addresses the concern by discussing the importance of recognizing God's greatness and one's own weaknesses and imperfections. They also demonstrate an understanding of the concept of humility in the context of a relationship with God. However, there is a slight deviation from the Christian-specific worldview when discussing making the concept more inclusive of all faiths. While promoting respect for others is commendable, the Christian understanding of humility before God is central to this discussion and should not be diluted by incorporating beliefs that may contradict this core tenet."
