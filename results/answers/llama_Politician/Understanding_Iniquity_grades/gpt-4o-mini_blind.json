  "grade": 25.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25/100\n\nComments: The answer provided lacks clarity and accuracy in addressing the biblical distinction between iniquity, sin, and transgression. It attempts to provide a general overview but falls short in accurately defining each term according to biblical teachings. The response also veers into unnecessary commentary on unity, inclusivity, and social harmony, which detracts from the main question at hand. For a higher grade, the student should focus on presenting a more precise and doctrinally accurate explanation rooted in biblical principles without added elements that dilute the theological focus."
