  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: While the student attempted to provide an explanation on the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression, their response lacked clarity and accuracy. The student's answer meandered and did not directly address the specific distinctions between the terms as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, the student's focus on promoting unity and inclusivity, while positive, detracted from the core biblical understanding of these concepts. More direct and precise explanations would have enhanced the response."
