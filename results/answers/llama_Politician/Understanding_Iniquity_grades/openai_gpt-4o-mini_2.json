  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a decent attempt to explain the distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression, with some accuracy in aligning with the given answer. The student acknowledges the importance of understanding these distinctions in helping Christians recognize the gravity of their actions and seek repentance, which is commendable. However, the response lacks depth and clarity in discussing the spiritual significance and implications of these distinctions from a Christian worldview. More scriptural references or theological insights could have been included to strengthen the explanation. Additionally, the response meanders at times, which detracts from the overall effectiveness of the explanation."
