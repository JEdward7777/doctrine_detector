However, it lacks specificity in referencing relevant biblical passages or teachings that directly address the topic. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into the biblical principles of innocence, justice, and compassion, and providing more concrete scriptural support to reinforce the points made. Additionally, connecting the concept of innocence to the redemptive work of Christ or the ultimate justice of God would enhance the theological depth of the answer."
