  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The response shows a respectful and inclusive approach to discussing the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and compassion, which are positive values. However, the response lacks doctrinal depth and specific references to key biblical teachings on the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession. To improve, the student should include more direct biblical references and explore the theological significance of the Holy Spirit's intercessory work in a more doctrinally accurate manner."
