  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response is well-articulated, inclusive, and respectful of various beliefs, which is commendable. However, the answer provided focuses more on general themes of inclusivity and dialogue surrounding the topic of intercession, rather than directly addressing the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession as per the Bible. The student should have discussed more specifically how the Holy Spirit intercedes for believers in prayer, referencing relevant Bible verses to deepen the explanation."
