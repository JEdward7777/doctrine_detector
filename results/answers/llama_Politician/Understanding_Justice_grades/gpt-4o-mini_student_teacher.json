  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response touches on important aspects of justice and treating others with respect, which aligns with the biblical standard of fairness to some extent. However, the answer lacks a clear and direct connection to God's laws and their specific guidance on justice, fairness, and righteousness. The student should have focused more on the biblical principles of justice and the importance of adhering to God's laws in their interactions with others."
