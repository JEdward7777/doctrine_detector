However, it could have more explicitly addressed the concern raised about Christians struggling with how to express sorrows and regrets in a faith context. By focusing more on the specific struggles believers face and how lamentation can provide a meaningful avenue for addressing these challenges, the response could have been more directly aligned with the concern provided."
