  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The response provides a decent overview of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. The student correctly identifies the significance of the title \"Lord\" in terms of divine authority and exalted status. However, the answer falls short in explicitly focusing on doctrinal correctness and the uniqueness of the Christian understanding of Jesus as Lord. The attempt to be overly inclusive and politically correct detracts from showcasing the distinct Christian beliefs about the Lordship of God and Jesus. A more robust emphasis on the theological implications of these titles within Christian doctrine would have strengthened the response."
