  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response misses the key point that the term 'Lord' signifies ownership or authority and is used as a title for God, communicating that Jesus is God. While the student provided some information about the significance of the term 'Lord' in Christian theology, their focus on inclusivity and avoiding offense detracts from the central Christian understanding of the term. It is important to prioritize accuracy and clarity in explaining theological concepts from a Christian worldview."
