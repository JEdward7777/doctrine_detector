The response fails to delve deeper into the Christian understanding of God's majesty and lacks clarity in articulating the biblical basis for this attribute. Furthermore, the student's attempt to avoid offending others by diluting the distinctiveness of the Christian faith hinders the depth of theological exploration required in a Christian worldview context. A stronger emphasis on scriptural references and a clearer focus on the exclusive nature of God's majesty within Christianity would have improved the response's doctrinal accuracy."
