  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's response contains elements of understanding regarding God's majesty, there are significant deviations from the Christian worldview by introducing relativism and inclusivity as primary considerations. The student failed to address in depth the concept of God's sovereignty over creation, which is crucial in explaining the significance of His majesty. The focus should have remained on God's greatness as the supreme King over the universe, emphasizing His authority and power. The student's answer lacked specificity and clarity in the context of Christian theology."
