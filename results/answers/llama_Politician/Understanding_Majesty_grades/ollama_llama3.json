  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'm grading based on a Christian-specific worldview.\n\nGrade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a rich and comprehensive understanding of God's majesty, highlighting its connection to His transcendence, power, sovereignty, authority, wisdom, and goodness. The writer also acknowledges the importance of respecting diverse faiths and belief systems, creating an inclusive environment where all feel valued and heard. While the answer doesn't directly match the provided response (\"The term 'majesty' signifies the greatness and splendor of God...\"), it offers a more nuanced exploration of the concept. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of God's attributes and sovereignty over creation.\n\nTo improve, consider providing a more direct connection to the original answer while still maintaining the depth and breadth of your response. Additionally, you may want to emphasize specific biblical passages or verses that support the majesty of God, further solidifying your argument."
