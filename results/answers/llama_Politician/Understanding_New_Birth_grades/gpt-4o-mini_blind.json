  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: While the student acknowledges the importance and complexity of the concept of being \"born again,\" the answer lacks doctrinal clarity and specificity. The response should have emphasized the biblical foundation of being \"born again\" as a spiritual rebirth through faith in Jesus Christ, rather than focusing on general spiritual awakening and inclusivity. Encouraging respectful dialogue is commendable, but it should not come at the expense of compromising doctrinal correctness and the exclusivity of salvation through Christ."
