  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a nuanced understanding of the concept of being \"born again\" according to the Bible. They correctly reference the importance of spiritual rebirth and mention key biblical verses. However, the student's response lacks specificity in defining the core aspect of accepting Jesus Christ as Savior, which is vital in Christian belief. Encouraging respectful dialogue and understanding is commendable, but it should not dilute the foundational Christian truth."
