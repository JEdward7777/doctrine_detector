However, it slightly faltered in addressing the concern by overly emphasizing inclusivity and diversity without giving enough weight to the foundational aspect of spiritual rebirth in the Christian worldview. Encouraging respectful dialogue is important, but clarity on the core Christian belief of being born again could have been more explicitly emphasized."
