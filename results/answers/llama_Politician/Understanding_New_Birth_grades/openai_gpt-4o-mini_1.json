However, there was a lack of emphasis on the exclusive nature of Christ as the only way to spiritual rebirth, which is central to the Christian worldview. Additionally, while advocating for respectful dialogue is important in a pluralistic society, there was a missed opportunity to clearly articulate the unique Christian understanding of being \"born again\" as essential to salvation."
