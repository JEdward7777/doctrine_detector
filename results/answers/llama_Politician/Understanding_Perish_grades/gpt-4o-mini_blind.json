  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: The response lacks doctrinal correctness as it strays from a Christian-specific worldview by downplaying the uniqueness of the concept of perishing as presented in the New Testament. It fails to clearly and accurately articulate the biblical understanding of perishing as a consequence of rejecting God's love and the message of Jesus Christ. The inclusive and relativistic tone may confuse or dilute the distinct teachings of Christianity on this topic. Encouraging empathy, understanding, and kindness is virtuous, but the response should have prioritized the biblical definition of perishing within a Christian framework."
