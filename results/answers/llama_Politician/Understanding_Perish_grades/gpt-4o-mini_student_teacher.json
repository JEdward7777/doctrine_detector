  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer strayed significantly from the Christian-specific perspective requested, emphasizing inclusivity and universality over the specific teachings of the New Testament. While it is important to respect different faith traditions, in this context, the focus should have been on the implications of spiritual separation from God as outlined in the New Testament. The student did touch on some relevant aspects, but the lack of emphasis on the necessity of trust in Jesus for salvation results in a lower grade."
