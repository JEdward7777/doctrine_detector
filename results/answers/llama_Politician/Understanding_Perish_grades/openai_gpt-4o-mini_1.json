However, there was a lack of focus on the Christian-specific understanding of perishing as separation from God due to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation. While inclusivity and respect for other faith traditions are important, the response could have delved deeper into the implications of spiritual separation from God from a Christian worldview."
