The response emphasizes inclusivity and diversity of human experience, but it lacks a clear focus on the specific Christian understanding of perishing in relation to rejecting God's love and ignoring Jesus' message. A more direct engagement with the concern and a stronger integration of Christian teachings would have improved the response."
