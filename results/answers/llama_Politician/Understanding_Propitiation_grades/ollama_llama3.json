  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in relation to propitiation, it falls short of fully addressing the concern of clearly understanding how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy. The response does touch on these concepts, but it is not entirely clear or concise in its explanation. Additionally, the response prioritizes inclusivity and sensitivity over a thorough examination of the theological concepts at play.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more specific and detailed explanations of how Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and mercy, rather than simply acknowledging that it does so."
