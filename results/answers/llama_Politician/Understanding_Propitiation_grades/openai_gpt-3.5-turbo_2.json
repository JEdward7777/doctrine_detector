However, it lacks a clear emphasis on how propitiation specifically relates to God's justice and mercy as the concern requested. The response is respectful of different beliefs but does not provide a thorough analysis or alignment with a Christian worldview in addressing the concern. More direct focus on the relationship between propitiation, God's justice, and mercy would strengthen the response."
