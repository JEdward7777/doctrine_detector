  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 60.\n\nWhile the response attempts to address the concept of Jesus' sacrifice in relation to propitiation, God's justice, and mercy, it falls short in providing a clear and definitive explanation. The writer does touch on the idea of Jesus' sacrifice satisfying God's justice and appeasing His wrath, but it gets lost in the vague and somewhat ambiguous language used throughout the response. There is an attempt to acknowledge the complexity and diversity of interpretations, but the lack of a strong, focused analysis of how propitiation specifically relates to God's justice and mercy leaves the explanation unclear.\n\nOverall, the response shows a willingness to consider different viewpoints and promote inclusivity but needs to better articulate the core Christian perspective on how Jesus' sacrifice directly addresses the concerns of divine justice and mercy."
