  "grade_comment": "Grade: 35/100\n\nComment: While the student's response touches on the general concept of purification in the Old Testament and its importance in maintaining spiritual cleanliness, there are significant shortcomings. The student fails to adequately address how the process of ritual purification reflects God\u2019s standards for holiness and the nature of sin, which was a key aspect of the concern provided. Additionally, the response lacks depth and accuracy in explaining the specifics of purification in the Old Testament, focusing more on generalities and personal reflections rather than theological insights. The reference answer from the teacher provides a clear and concise explanation that the student's response lacks."
