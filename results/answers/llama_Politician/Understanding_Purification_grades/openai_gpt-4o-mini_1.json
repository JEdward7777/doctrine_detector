It reflects an awareness of how this ritual purification aligns with God's standards for holiness and the recognition of sin. The explanation could have delved deeper into the theological significance of sin and holiness in the context of purification, connecting it more explicitly to God's nature and expectations for His people. Overall, a solid response with room for more theological depth."
