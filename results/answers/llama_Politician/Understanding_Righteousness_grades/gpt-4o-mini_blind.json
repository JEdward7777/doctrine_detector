However, it lacks depth in explaining the theological significance of God's righteousness within Christian doctrine. The answer also veers into a somewhat relativistic approach by emphasizing individual perspectives and experiences, which can detract from the firm foundation of biblical truth. While the answer touches on some important aspects, a stronger focus on biblical truth and doctrinal specificity would have greatly improved the response."
