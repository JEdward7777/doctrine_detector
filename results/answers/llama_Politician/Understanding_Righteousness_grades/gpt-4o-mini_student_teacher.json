  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 50.\n\nWhile the student touches on some aspects of God's righteousness, such as being just, fair, and morally upright, their answer lacks a clear emphasis on God's absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love. Additionally, the student's answer does not directly address the concern about the importance of understanding God's righteousness in relation to His justice and love. The student's response also meanders into general statements about respecting different perspectives and living ethically, which although valuable, stray from a focused explanation on the nature of God's righteousness. Overall, the answer lacks depth and specificity in addressing the Christian worldview perspective on God's righteousness."
