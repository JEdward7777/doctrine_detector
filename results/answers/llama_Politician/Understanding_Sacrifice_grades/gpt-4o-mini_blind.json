  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: The answer provides a general overview of the symbolism of Jesus being referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to Old Testament sacrifices. It acknowledges the importance of sacrifice in Jewish tradition and Jesus' willingness to lay down his life for humanity. However, there are some key doctrinal components missing. To improve, the student should have emphasized the theological significance of Jesus as the perfect sacrificial lamb, fulfilling the ultimate atonement for sin as prophesied in the Old Testament. Additionally, a clearer connection to the Passover lamb and the concept of substitutionary atonement would strengthen the explanation. The student's answer lacks depth and fails to fully align with a Christian worldview regarding Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament sacrificial foreshadowing."
