  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the symbolic significance of Jesus being called the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. They correctly highlight Jesus' willingness to lay down his life for humanity's salvation, drawing parallels between Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice and the sacrificial lambs in the Old Testament. However, the student could have further emphasized the theological importance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by highlighting the concept of Jesus as the perfect and unblemished sacrifice. Overall, the student's response shows thoughtful reflection and insight, but could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the theological implications of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice in fulfilling God's redemptive plan."
