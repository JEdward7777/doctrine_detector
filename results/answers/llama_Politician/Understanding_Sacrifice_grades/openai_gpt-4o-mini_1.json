  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrated a solid understanding of the significance of Jesus being referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to his sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption. The student effectively connected the symbolism of the lamb in the Old Testament with Jesus' ultimate sacrifice. The response appropriately emphasized the importance of sensitivity and respect when discussing sacred texts and symbols, aligning well with the Christian worldview. However, the slight deduction in points is due to the response veering slightly off topic towards the end by shifting the focus onto navigating discussions around sacred texts and symbols, which was not directly related to the specific concern provided."
