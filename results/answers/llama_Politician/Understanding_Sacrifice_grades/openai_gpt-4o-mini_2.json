  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and insightful exploration of the significance of Jesus being called the \"Lamb of God\" within the context of Old Testament sacrificial symbolism. The student shows a good understanding of the analogical connection between Jesus as the unblemished sacrifice and the sacrificial lambs in the Old Testament. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the sacrificial role of Jesus to the fulfillment of God's plan for redemption. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid grasp of the Christian significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in God's plan for redemption."
