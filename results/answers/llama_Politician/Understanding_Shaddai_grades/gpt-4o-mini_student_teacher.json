However, the response lacked depth in discussing the specific attributes of God as revealed in Scripture, focusing more on the general understanding of the term \"Shaddai.\" Encouraging the student to delve deeper into the theological implications of God's nature and characteristics as revealed through the use of the term \"Shaddai\" would enhance the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
