  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a clear and detailed explanation of the term \"Shaddai\" in the Old Testament, including its significance and various uses throughout biblical context. The writer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and its relationship to God's attributes, such as power, omnipotence, and majesty. They also provide specific examples from the book of Job to illustrate their points.\n\nThe response is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear transitions between ideas. The writer shows a commitment to understanding and respecting different perspectives, which aligns with the concern about navigating religious traditions.\n\nHowever, I deduct 15 points because this response does not directly address the concern about the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. While it does provide information about Shaddai's relationship to God's power and majesty, it could be more explicitly connected to the concern.\n\nOverall, a great effort!"
