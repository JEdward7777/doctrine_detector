It explores how the term is used to underscore God's role as a just judge and the bestower of wisdom. The intricate connection between different divine names is also acknowledged. However, there could be a more explicit reference to the Christian understanding of God's nature and attributes as revealed in Scripture, such as linking the concept of Shaddai to the Christian belief in the triune nature of God or His redemptive plan through Jesus Christ."
