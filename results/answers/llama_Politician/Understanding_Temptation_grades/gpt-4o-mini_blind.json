  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response attempts to approach the topic with sensitivity and inclusivity, it falls short in providing a clear and doctrinally correct analysis of Jesus' strategies to resist temptation. The answer should focus more on the specifics of Jesus' use of Scripture, divine authority, and humility without minimizing the fundamental Christian beliefs underlying the narrative. Encouraging respectful dialogue is commendable, but the response could benefit from a stronger biblical focus in addressing the question directly. Improving the doctrinal accuracy and depth of analysis would enhance the grade."
