The student's answer offers valuable insights on the broader implications of Jesus' actions, but misses the mark in directly connecting His use of scripture and faith to resist temptation. A stronger focus on the biblical narrative and its application to combatting temptation in daily life would have enhanced the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
