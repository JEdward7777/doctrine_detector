  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of Jesus' strategies in resisting temptation based on scripture and faith, aligning well with the concern of combating temptation as a follower of Christ. The inclusion of broader implications and the emphasis on humility and self-awareness add depth to the discussion. The only area for improvement could be to explicitly tie the strategies discussed back to practical applications for resisting temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ."
