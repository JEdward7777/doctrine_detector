  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some good points about the relationship between trespass and sin in a Christian worldview. However, the response lacks clarity and depth in explaining this relationship specifically in terms of interpersonal violations and sin against God, which was the specified concern. The student also dilutes the Christian perspective by emphasizing subjective viewpoints and inclusivity over a clear understanding of Christian ethics. More focus on the Christian theological framework and less on personal opinions would strengthen the response."
