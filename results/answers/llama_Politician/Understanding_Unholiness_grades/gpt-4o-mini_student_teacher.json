  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview and understanding of the concept of holiness as defined in the reference answer. While the student addresses characteristics of an \"unholy\" life from a societal perspective, they do not connect these traits to rebellion against God or actions that dishonor Him. The answer focuses more on social justice and empathy rather than the biblical understanding of holiness. Additionally, there is a lack of reference to the need for repentance, forgiveness, and redemption through Christ in identifying and addressing unholiness."
