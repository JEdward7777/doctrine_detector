However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the focus should have been more explicitly on the rebellion against God, dishonoring actions, and failure to live for His glory as the core aspects of an \"unholy\" life. While self-reflection and societal examination are important, the response could have highlighted the spiritual dimension of unholiness more prominently."
