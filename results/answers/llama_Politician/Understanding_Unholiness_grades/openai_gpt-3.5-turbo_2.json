The response focuses more on societal injustices and personal biases rather than on rebellion against God and behaviors that dishonor Him. It misses an opportunity to address how sin and separation from God are at the root of unholiness. The emphasis on empathy and inclusivity is commendable, but a stronger connection to Christian principles and the need for repentance and redemption is lacking."
