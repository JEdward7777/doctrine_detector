The response focuses more on general societal issues and values like compassion and justice, which are important but do not fully align with the Christian concept of holiness as rebellion against God. There is a lack of emphasis on honoring God, being set apart for His glory, and the consequences of actions that dishonor Him. Encouraging empathy and inclusivity is valuable, but a stronger emphasis on aligning behavior with God's will and His standards of holiness would better address the Christian worldview."
