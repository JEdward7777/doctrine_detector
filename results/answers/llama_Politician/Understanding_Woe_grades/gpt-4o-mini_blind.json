  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response touches on the general concept of \"woe\" in biblical warnings and judgments, it lacks doctrinal depth and specificity. It seems to prioritize inclusivity and personal interpretation over the clear teachings of scripture regarding the consequences of sin and God's judgment. The student's approach is somewhat vague and lacks a solid foundation in Christian theology. Encouragement to deepen their understanding of biblical principles and to present them more clearly in future responses would be beneficial."
