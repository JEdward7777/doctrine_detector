  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks a clear and direct explanation of the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment in the context of the term \"woe.\" While the response touches on the concept of sorrow and distress, it fails to explicitly link this to the consequences of sin and divine judgment as outlined in the Bible. There is an emphasis on maintaining diversity of interpretation, which is important, but in this context, a clearer articulation of the Christian perspective on the consequences of sin and judgment would have been more appropriate. The answer also does not address the specific concern raised in the question."
