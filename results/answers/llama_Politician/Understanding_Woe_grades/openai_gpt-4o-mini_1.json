  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65/100\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a commendable effort to approach the topic with sensitivity and nuance, acknowledging diverse perspectives. However, the response falls short in addressing the concern directly. While it touches on the figurative and symbolic aspects of \"woe,\" it does not clearly emphasize the biblical perspective that woe serves as a warning of impending judgment for sin. To receive a higher grade, a more focused discussion on the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment would have been beneficial."
