## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
The term "worldly" can be a bit...delicate, don't you think? In Christian teachings, being "worldly" can imply that someone is overly focused on earthly pursuits, rather than spiritual ones. It's not necessarily a value judgment per se, but rather an observation about priorities.

According to scripture, the world can be seen as a place of temptation and distraction from our true purpose, which is to serve God. So, when we're too caught up in worldly things – like wealth, power, or material possessions – it can lead us astray from what's truly important.

Now, I want to emphasize that this doesn't mean all worldly pursuits are inherently bad. We can learn valuable lessons from the world around us and appreciate its beauty and wonders. It's more about striking a balance between our spiritual lives and our daily experiences.

In fact, many Christian teachings encourage us to be good stewards of the earth and engage with the world in positive ways, while still keeping our eyes on eternal rewards. So, let's focus on being responsible global citizens, shall we?
