  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer does touch on some aspects of the contrast between worldly values and godly principles according to Christian teachings. However, the answer lacks clarity in emphasizing the negative connotations of being \"worldly\" as outlined in the reference answer. The student could have provided a more direct and unequivocal explanation regarding the harmful nature of worldly values in contrast to godly principles."
