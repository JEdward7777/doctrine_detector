  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-reasoned and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of \"worldly\" within a Christian worldview. The student clearly articulates the tension between engaging with the world and remaining focused on spiritual values, while also providing thoughtful examples and scripture references to support their claims. While their response slightly deviates from the provided reference answer, it offers a more nuanced and balanced interpretation of the term."
