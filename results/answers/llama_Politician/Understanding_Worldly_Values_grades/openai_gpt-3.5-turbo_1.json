  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful exploration of the concept of being \"worldly\" from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the balance between engaging with the world and prioritizing spiritual pursuits. While it acknowledges the potential dangers of worldly pursuits leading one astray from God, it also highlights the importance of being good stewards of the earth and engaging with the world in positive ways. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, but could have further emphasized the need to discern and reject the negative worldly values mentioned in the initial answer."
