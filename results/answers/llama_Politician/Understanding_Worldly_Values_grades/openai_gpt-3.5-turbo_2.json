It emphasizes the importance of balancing spiritual focus with engagement in the world. However, while it recognizes the potential for learning from the world and being good stewards of the earth, it could have more clearly highlighted the contrast between worldly values (selfishness, corruption, ungodliness) and godly principles. The response could have strengthened its alignment with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the need to reject worldly values that go against godly principles."
