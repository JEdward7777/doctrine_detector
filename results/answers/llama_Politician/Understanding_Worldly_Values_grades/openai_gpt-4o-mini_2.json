  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful reflection on the concept of being \"worldly\" from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the balance between engaging with the world and prioritizing spiritual matters. It acknowledges the potential dangers of being overly focused on worldly pursuits while also highlighting the importance of being good stewards of the earth. The response effectively addresses the concern about understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles, but could have included more specific references to scripture to strengthen the Christian perspective."
