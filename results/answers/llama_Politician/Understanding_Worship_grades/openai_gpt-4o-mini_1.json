However, the focus on inclusivity, diversity of beliefs, and tolerance may dilute the significance of worship specifically in a Christian's life as it reflects their relationship with God. The response could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the unique aspects of Christian worship and how it deepens the believer's connection with God."
