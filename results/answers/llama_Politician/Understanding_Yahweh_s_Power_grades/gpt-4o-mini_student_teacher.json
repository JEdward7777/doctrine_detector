  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-written analysis of the statement \"I am Yahweh\" in the context of commands and promises. They effectively highlighted key aspects of God's character and power, emphasizing His sovereignty, relational nature, and the connection between His power and promises. The student also touched on the implications for human responsibility in responding to God's word. However, they could have strengthened their answer by directly addressing the concern about understanding the nature of God's authority and the implications of His commands more explicitly, as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
