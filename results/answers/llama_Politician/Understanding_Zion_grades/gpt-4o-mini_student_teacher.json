  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel, acknowledging its historical and cultural significance. However, the student misses addressing the concern of the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people. The answer focuses more on the cultural and historical aspects rather than delving into the theological implications of the term. Additionally, while promoting tolerance and inclusivity is important, the response could have been strengthened by integrating more theological insights from a Christian worldview perspective."
