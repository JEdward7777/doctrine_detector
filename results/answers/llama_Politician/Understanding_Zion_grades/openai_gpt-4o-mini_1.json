It acknowledges the metaphorical language used in Scripture and the implications of this language for understanding God's relationship with His people. The response could have further emphasized the theological significance of this term within the Christian worldview and connected it more explicitly to God's covenantal promises and love for Israel. Overall, a solid understanding but could benefit from deeper theological reflection."
