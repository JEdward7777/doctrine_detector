  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The response provides some correct information about Sheol and Hades and attempts to draw a distinction between the afterlife of the righteous and unrighteous based on certain biblical passages. However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness in its interpretation and application of the biblical verses. It fails to acknowledge the fundamental Christian belief in salvation through Jesus Christ and the importance of faith in Him for determining one's eternal destiny. The response also mixes in political language and does not fully align with a Christian worldview. Further development and clarification with a focus on biblical teachings and theological principles would greatly improve the grade."
