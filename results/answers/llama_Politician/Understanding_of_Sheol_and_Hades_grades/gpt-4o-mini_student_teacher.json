  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: The student's answer shows some understanding of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the Bible, but there are significant inaccuracies and a lack of depth in their explanation. The student failed to accurately address the concern of understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death. They presented some relevant biblical verses but failed to provide a coherent analysis tying them back to the question. Additionally, the answer lacks a clear Christian worldview perspective in interpreting the concepts. Further research and a deeper engagement with the biblical texts would improve their response."
