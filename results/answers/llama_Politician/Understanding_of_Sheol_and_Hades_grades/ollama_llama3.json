  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the biblical contexts of Sheol and Hades, including their differences and connotations. It also addresses the concern by highlighting the distinction between the afterlife of the righteous and unrighteous, with specific references to relevant biblical passages.\n\nThe response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical material and effectively answers the question. The only areas for improvement are in terms of clarity and concision. Some sentences could be rephrased or combined to improve the overall flow and readability of the text.\n\nFor example, the final paragraph could be condensed into a single sentence that summarizes the main point about the distinction between the afterlife of the righteous and unrighteous. Additionally, some of the language used is overly formal and could be toned down for a more conversational tone.\n\nOverall, however, the response is well-organized, informative, and effectively addresses the concern, making it deserving of an 85 grade."
