It references relevant biblical passages and offers insightful interpretations. However, the response could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the understanding of the fates of the righteous and unrighteous to a Christian worldview perspective, emphasizing the significance of salvation through Christ in determining the afterlife outcomes."
