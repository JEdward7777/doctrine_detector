  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the biblical concepts of Sheol and Hades and their evolution in understanding over time. It effectively addresses the concern by elaborating on the distinctions between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death based on biblical references. The response demonstrates a sound understanding of Christian theological concepts and presents the information in a respectful and informative manner."
