However, the answer lacks doctrinal clarity and specificity in explaining the significance of Jesus Christ as the cornerstone from a Christian worldview. It also dilutes the exclusive nature of Christ as the cornerstone by emphasizing inclusivity without grounding it in the biblical truth that Jesus is the only way to salvation (John 14:6). The response could be improved by delving deeper into the unique role of Jesus Christ as the cornerstone in the context of the Church and emphasizing the foundational truth of Christ's deity and salvific work."
