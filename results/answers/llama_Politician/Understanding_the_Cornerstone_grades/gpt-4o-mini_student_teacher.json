  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response delves into various aspects of Jesus as the \"cornerstone\" within the Assembly of believers and emphasizes unity, reconciliation, and diversity. While the student's language is eloquent and inclusive, the answer lacks a clear and direct connection to the concern provided. A stronger grade would require a more focused explanation directly addressing the significance of Christ's role in impacting a believer's faith and community involvement."
