  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Jesus Christ as the cornerstone of the Church, drawing upon biblical references and emphasizing the unity and diversity within the community of believers. The writer shows a deep understanding of the importance of Christ's role in shaping faith and fostering community involvement. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how a believer's understanding of Christ's role can impact their faith and engagement within the church. The only area for improvement could be to emphasize more explicitly how this understanding might lead to specific actions or changes in community involvement based on the belief in Jesus as the cornerstone."
