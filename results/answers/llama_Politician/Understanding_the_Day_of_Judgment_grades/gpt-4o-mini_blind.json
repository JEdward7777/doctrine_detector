The emphasis on inclusivity and diversity of beliefs, while important in certain contexts, takes precedence over conveying the specific Christian perspective on this theological concept. The response could benefit from a stronger focus on the doctrinal teachings and implications of Jesus Christ's role as the judge on the day of judgment within Christianity."
