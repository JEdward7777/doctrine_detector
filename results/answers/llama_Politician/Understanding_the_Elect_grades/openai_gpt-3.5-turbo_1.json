While the mention of being predestined for salvation and serving as a light aligns with Christian teachings, the emphasis on universal principles and avoiding controversy dilutes the Christian worldview in this context. The response could benefit from a clearer articulation of how being part of the \"elect\" is central to Christian beliefs and the unique role it plays in a Christian's faith journey."
