However, it lacks doctrinal specificity and depth in its examination of the term within a biblical context. The answer could benefit greatly from a more focused exploration of how the Bible itself defines and portrays the \"house of God,\" such as through references to the tabernacle, Solomon's temple, and the New Testament descriptions of the church as the body of Christ. Emphasizing the unique Christian perspective on this term would significantly improve the theological accuracy of the response."
