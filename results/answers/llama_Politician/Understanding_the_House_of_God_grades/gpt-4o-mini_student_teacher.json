  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written and thoughtful answer that explores the concept of the \"house of God\" in various religious traditions. However, the answer would benefit from a stronger focus on the specific biblical context. While acknowledging the different perspectives across religions is important, the core meaning of the \"house of God\" in Scripture pertains to a place where God is worshiped, such as the tabernacle or the temple. The answer could have been stronger if it delved deeper into the biblical significance and meaning, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided."
