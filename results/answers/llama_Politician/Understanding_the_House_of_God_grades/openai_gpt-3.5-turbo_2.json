  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the \"house of God\" in a variety of religious contexts and highlights the importance of respecting different beliefs and practices. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the significance and meaning of the term in Scripture. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview but could benefit from a more explicit connection to Christian theology and teachings regarding the \"house of God.\""
