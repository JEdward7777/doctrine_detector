  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and respectful exploration of the concept of the \"house of God\" across different religious traditions. While the answer does touch on the significance of the term in Scripture, it also broadens the discussion to incorporate perspectives from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of sensitivity and respect when discussing religious concepts. However, it could benefit from a more focused explanation specific to the Christian worldview, addressing the tabernacle and temple more explicitly."
