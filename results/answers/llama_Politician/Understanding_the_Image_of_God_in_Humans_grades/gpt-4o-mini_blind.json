  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: While the response explores various characteristics that reflect the image of God in humanity, it falls short in doctrinal correctness. The answer lacks a clear emphasis on key biblical principles such as sin nature and redemption through Christ. Additionally, it focuses more on inclusivity and diversity rather than grounding the discussion in biblical truths. The student should strive to align their answer more closely with core Christian doctrines and provide a deeper theological analysis based on biblical teachings."
