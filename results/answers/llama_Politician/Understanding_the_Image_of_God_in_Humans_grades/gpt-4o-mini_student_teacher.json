  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive overview of various characteristics associated with reflecting the image of God according to the biblical definition. However, there is a lack of focus on specifically identifying the characteristics mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's answer, though insightful, could benefit from directly aligning with the given answer to address the concern of deepening understanding of being created in the image of God from a biblical perspective."
