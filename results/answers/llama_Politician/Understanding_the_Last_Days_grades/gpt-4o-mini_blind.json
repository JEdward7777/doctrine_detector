  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While the answer attempts to provide a broad and inclusive perspective on the concept of the \"last days\" in Christian tradition, it falls short in providing doctrinal correctness and clarity. The response lacks a clear explanation of the significance of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings according to traditional Christian beliefs. The emphasis on inclusivity and sensitivity, while important, should not come at the expense of the core doctrinal teachings. The answer could benefit from a more explicit connection between the \"last days\" and the biblical timeline of Jesus' comings as understood within Christian theology."
