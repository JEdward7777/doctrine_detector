  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student attempted to approach the topic with inclusivity, sensitivity, and respect for diverse perspectives, the response falls short in addressing the concern of understanding the timeline of major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith. The student's answer lacks specificity and clarity regarding the significance of the 'last days' in relation to Jesus' first and second comings from a Christian worldview. It is important for the student to provide a more focused and accurate explanation rooted in Christian theology to address the concern effectively."
