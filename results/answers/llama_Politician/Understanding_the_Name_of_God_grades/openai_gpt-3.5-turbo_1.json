However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern about understanding the personal nature of God and His relationship with humanity. While inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs are important, maintaining the core theological understanding of Yahweh's personal name and its implications for God's existence and presence should have been emphasized more clearly. The response could benefit from a stronger assertion of the Christian-specific understanding of Yahweh in relation to God's personal nature and relationship with humanity."
