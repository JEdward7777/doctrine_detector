However, the emphasis on inclusivity and respect for all beliefs somewhat dilutes the Christian-specific understanding of Yahweh as representing God's personal name and His relationship with humanity. The response could have delved deeper into the Christian theological significance of the name \"Yahweh\" in reference to God's existence and presence."
