  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 75. \n\nWhile the student has provided a thorough explanation of the connections between the Old Testament judges and Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior, they have strayed slightly from the concern about grasping the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation. The student focused more on the similarities between judges and Jesus rather than emphasizing how the concept of judges as saviors in the Old Testament informs our understanding of Jesus as the ultimate Savior in the New Testament in terms of the continuity of God's plan for salvation. \n\nAdditionally, the student's response could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern provided. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and incorporated Christian principles throughout their answer."
