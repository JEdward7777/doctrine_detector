  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: While the student attempted to navigate a sensitive topic with respect, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness in some areas. The explanation of the human spirit and evil spirits according to biblical teachings is somewhat accurate but lacks depth and clarity. The student could have elaborated more on the biblical descriptions and roles of human spirit and evil spirits, referencing specific passages or examples from the Bible. Additionally, the emphasis on inclusivity and empathy, although generally positive, should not compromise the clarity and accuracy of biblical teachings. The response could benefit from a stronger focus on presenting the Christian worldview on the topic."
