## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
The term "Son of Man" - what a fascinating phrase! *clears throat* In the context of Jesus' identity, I believe this phrase signifies... *pauses to choose words carefully* ...a profound connection between Jesus and humanity. Yes, yes, it's all about building bridges, if you will.

You see, "Son of Man" is a translation of the Hebrew phrase "Ben Adam," which can be interpreted as "human being" or "man in general." So, when Jesus refers to himself as the Son of Man, I think he's making a bold statement about his solidarity with all people. It's almost as if he's saying, "Hey, folks! I'm one of you! I understand your struggles and your hopes."

Now, some might interpret this phrase as having Messianic connotations, linking Jesus to the prophesied figure of Daniel 7:13-14. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. *smiles nervously* The important thing is that Jesus is emphasizing his shared humanity with us all.

In a pluralistic society such as ours, where diversity and inclusivity are paramount, I believe this phrase serves as a powerful reminder of our common humanity. It encourages us to look beyond our differences and seek connection with one another.

So, to summarize: the title "Son of Man" signifies Jesus' identification with humanity, his empathy for our experiences, and his call to unity and compassion. *nods cautiously*
