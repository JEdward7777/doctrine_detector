The emphasis on Jesus' solidarity with humanity is valid, but the answer could have delved more into the Hebraic roots of the term and its Messianic implications as seen in Daniel 7:13-14. The response falls short in exploring the deeper theological and eschatological underpinnings associated with Jesus' use of this title. Additionally, it could benefit from a clearer presentation of the unique and divinely appointed nature of Jesus as the Son of Man in Christian theology."
