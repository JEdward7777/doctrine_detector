However, the student missed the crucial aspect of Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is essential in understanding the significance of this title in the context of Jesus' identity and its implications for our faith from a Christian worldview. The student's interpretation, while insightful in some aspects, falls short of capturing the deeper theological implications of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man'."
