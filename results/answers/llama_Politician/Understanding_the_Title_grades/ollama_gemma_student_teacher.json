  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the title \"Son of Man\" and its significance in Jesus' identity. They successfully connect the phrase to Jesus' solidarity with humanity and its connection to the broader concept of shared humanity in a diverse society. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a more direct engagement with the provided concern. While the student touches on the Messianic connotations of the title, they don't explicitly address its significance in terms of Jesus' dual nature. Additionally, the answer could be more concise and focus more directly on the specified concern."
