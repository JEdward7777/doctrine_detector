The concern about understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' and its implications for faith is not fully addressed or expounded upon in the response. Additionally, there is a lack of depth in discussing the Messianic aspect of the title 'Son of Man' and its implications for salvation. There is room for improvement in aligning the interpretation with Christian beliefs."
