However, it fell short of fully embracing the Christian worldview by not explicitly acknowledging Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, as well as His role as the Messiah. To enhance the theological depth of the explanation and align it more closely with Christian beliefs, a stronger emphasis on these aspects would have been beneficial."
