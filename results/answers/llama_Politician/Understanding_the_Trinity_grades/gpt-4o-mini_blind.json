  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the complexity of the question and encourages respectful dialogue, it falls short in addressing the doctrinal understanding of the Trinity from a Christian perspective. The Trinitarian nature of God is a foundational doctrine in Christianity, not simply a matter of personal interpretation or cultural relativism. The student's response lacks depth in explaining the biblical basis and theological significance of the Trinity in a Christian worldview. The focus on inclusivity and diversity, while important in some contexts, shouldn't overshadow the need for doctrinal clarity when discussing core beliefs of a faith."
