However, the focus on inclusivity and respect for all beliefs may lead to a potential dilution of the uniqueness of the Christian understanding of the Trinity as a foundational doctrine. While promoting dialogue and mutual understanding is commendable, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the distinctiveness and non-negotiable nature of the Trinity within Christianity."
