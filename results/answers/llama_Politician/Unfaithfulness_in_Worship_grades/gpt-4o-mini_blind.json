It lacks doctrinal correctness by not clearly stating the specific instances and behaviors that constituted unfaithfulness in worship according to biblical accounts. The emphasis on avoiding any language perceived as critical or insensitive detracts from the necessary clarity on the actions that led to unfaithfulness. Encouragement to learn from mistakes and strive for faithfulness is commendable, but the response could benefit from a more direct engagement with biblical teachings on this topic."
