  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: While the student attempts to approach the question with respect for diverse perspectives, there are several doctrinal concerns in the response. The student's preface implying all religious beliefs are equally valid contradicts Christian doctrine, which teaches that salvation is found exclusively through Jesus Christ (John 14:6). The emphasis on compassion and empathy is important, but the response lacks a clear presentation of the biblical teaching on the consequences of rejecting God and His will. The student should focus more on accurately conveying Christian beliefs rather than prioritizing inclusivity at the expense of doctrinal accuracy."
