However, the initial preface suggesting all religious beliefs are valid and deserving of respect may not fully align with a Christian worldview that upholds the uniqueness and exclusivity of Christianity as the way to salvation through Jesus Christ. The response could have emphasized more clearly the Christian belief in the consequences of rejecting God's will and the need for repentance and faith in Christ for redemption."
