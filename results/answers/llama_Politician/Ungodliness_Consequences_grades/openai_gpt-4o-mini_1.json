The mention of consequences in this life and the importance of compassion and empathy are valid points, but the response could have delved deeper into the scriptural teachings on the eternal separation from God for those who do not repent and turn to Him. A more explicit connection between disobedience and the spiritual ramifications in the afterlife would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
