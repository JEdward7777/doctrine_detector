  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thorough response that correctly identifies the usage of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively explains the significance of the term in relation to God's holiness and power in the Old Testament, as well as its connection to Jesus Christ in the New Testament. However, the student briefly mentions angels or other divine beings as possible recipients of the term, which does not directly address the concern of exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament."
