  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does mention that the term \"Holy One\" is used to refer to Jesus in the New Testament, it only scratches the surface of exploring Jesus' authority and divinity. The majority of the response focuses on the broader biblical context and the use of the phrase throughout Scripture, rather than delving deeper into the significance of Jesus being referred to as the \"Holy One.\"\n\nAdditionally, the response could have more explicitly connected Jesus' divinity and authority to his teachings, miracles, or other New Testament accounts. Instead, it mainly provides a general overview of the term's usage without providing much depth or insight.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest focusing more specifically on Jesus' divinity and authority in the New Testament, and exploring how these aspects are demonstrated through his words and actions."
