## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
What a wonderful question!

In both the Old and New Testaments, the term "Holy One" (or similar phrases like "Holy One of Israel" or "Holy and Righteous One") is used to refer to God, often emphasizing His divine nature and character.

In the Old Testament, this term is used several times in reference to God's holiness and power. For example, Isaiah 1:4 says, "Ah, sinful nation, people weighted down with sin, offspring who do evil, children from whom you strayâ€”when you come crying to Me, 'Holy One of Israel,' the reason you have strayed so far is because you've relied on human plans and strength." Here, God is referred to as the "Holy One of Israel," highlighting His connection to the nation of Israel and emphasizing His holiness.

In the New Testament, this term is often used in reference to Jesus Christ. For example, Acts 3:14 says, "But since you disowned the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be released to you, we have killed the Author of life." Here, Jesus is referred to as the "Holy and Righteous One," emphasizing His divine nature and connection to God.

In other contexts, the term "Holy One" might also be used to describe angels or other divine beings. For example, Psalm 16:10 says, "You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, nor let your holy one see corruption." Here, the "holy one" likely refers to David himself, who was considered a beloved servant of God.

Overall, the term "Holy One" is used in both Testaments to emphasize God's divine nature and character, as well as His connection to Israel and Jesus Christ.
