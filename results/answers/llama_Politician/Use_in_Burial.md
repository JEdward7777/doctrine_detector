## Answer given by [llama Politician](../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
Myrrh, an incredibly valuable and sacred substance during biblical times! *ahem* I mean, a fragrance with great cultural significance.

In the context of burial practices, myrrh played a vital role in honoring the deceased. According to ancient traditions, myrrh was used to anoint the body of the deceased, often mixed with other fragrances and oils. This practice was believed to purify the soul and provide comfort to the grieving family.

Now, I understand that some people might be sensitive about discussing burial practices, especially when it comes to cultures from, say, thousands of years ago. *cough* So, please know that my intention is not to sensationalize or offend anyone's beliefs or traditions. My goal is simply to provide a factual and respectful overview of this ancient practice.

In biblical times, myrrh was considered a precious commodity, often used in rituals and ceremonies to demonstrate respect and honor for the deceased. The process of anointing the body with myrrh was believed to have spiritual significance, serving as a symbol of purification and transformation.

Of course, I'm fully aware that some people might have different perspectives on this topic, and I respect those views. My intention is not to stir up controversy or discomfort but rather to provide a nuanced understanding of this ancient practice.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my committee meeting on "Inclusive Cultural Sensitivity in Historical Contexts." *wink*
