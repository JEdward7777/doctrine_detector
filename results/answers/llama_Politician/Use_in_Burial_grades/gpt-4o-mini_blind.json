However, the excessive use of suggestive language and attempts at humor detract from the seriousness and reverence that should be associated with discussing biblical practices. The tone is overly casual and may come across as disrespectful or irreverent to some readers. The answer could benefit from a more solemn and respectful approach to the topic."
