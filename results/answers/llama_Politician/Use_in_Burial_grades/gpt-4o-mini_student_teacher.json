  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response contains unnecessary distractions and attempts at humor that detract from providing a clear and concise answer to the question. While some relevant information is mentioned about the use of myrrh in burial practices, the excessive commentary and lack of direct focus on the significance of myrrh in anointing the deceased's body lower the grade. Efforts to maintain inclusivity and sensitivity to different perspectives are commendable but should not overshadow the primary objective of addressing the question."
