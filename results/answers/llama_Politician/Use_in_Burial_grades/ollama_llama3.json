  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively explains the role of myrrh in ancient burial practices, highlighting its significance as a symbol of purification and transformation. The writer also acknowledges potential sensitivities around discussing cultural customs from thousands of years ago and expresses respect for different perspectives on the topic.\n\nThe response is well-structured, easy to follow, and free of major errors or inaccuracies. The inclusion of *ahem*, *cough*, and *wink* adds a lighthearted tone that helps to engage the reader.\n\nHowever, to achieve a higher grade, the response could provide more specific biblical context for the use of myrrh in burial practices. Additionally, while the writer acknowledges the potential controversy surrounding this topic, they could further demonstrate sensitivity and cultural awareness by exploring how understanding these customs can enhance comprehension of scripture (as stated in the concern).\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid overview of myrrh's significance in ancient burial practices and demonstrates an effort to approach the topic with cultural sensitivity."
