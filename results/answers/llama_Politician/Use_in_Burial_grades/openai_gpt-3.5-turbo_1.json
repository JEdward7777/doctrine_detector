The writer's intention to be respectful and factual is commendable. However, there is some unnecessary humor and self-awareness that detracts from the seriousness of the topic. While it is important to be culturally sensitive, the response could have delved deeper into the Christian perspective on burial practices and the spiritual significance of myrrh."
