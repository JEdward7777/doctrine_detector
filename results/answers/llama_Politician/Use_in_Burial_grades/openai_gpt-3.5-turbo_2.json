  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively acknowledges the importance of myrrh in burial practices, aligning with the given answer. It also addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of understanding cultural contexts in scripture. However, there is some unnecessary humor and informal language that detracts from the overall professionalism of the response. A more serious tone and a deeper exploration of the cultural and religious significance of myrrh in biblical times would have enhanced the grade."
