However, the excessive use of humorous asides and informal language detracts from the seriousness of the topic. The response could benefit from a more focused and respectful tone towards the cultural and religious significance of myrrh in biblical times. Additionally, while the response acknowledges different perspectives, it could have further emphasized the importance of understanding burial customs in a biblical context for a deeper comprehension of cultural contexts in scripture."
