  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the significance of myrrh in burial practices and its importance in honoring the deceased, aligning with the given answer. However, the excessive use of humor and asides detracts from the seriousness of the topic and may come across as insensitive or dismissive of the concern raised. While the response attempts to be inclusive and respectful, the tone undermines the depth and solemnity of the subject matter. If presented with more reverence and focus, the content could have been more impactful in addressing the concern effectively."
