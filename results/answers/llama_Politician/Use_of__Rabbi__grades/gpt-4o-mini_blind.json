However, it falls short doctrinally as it equates John the Baptist and Jesus as mere recipients of the title \"Rabbi\" by certain individuals or groups. In Christian doctrine, Jesus holds a unique and supreme authority as the Son of God, far surpassing the title of \"Rabbi\" attributed to Him. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of Jesus being called \"Rabbi\" in relation to His role as the Messiah and Savior."
