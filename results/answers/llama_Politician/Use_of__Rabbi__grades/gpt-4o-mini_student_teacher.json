  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-intentioned response, but focused more on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity rather than directly addressing the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The student did mention that the term \"Rabbi\" likely conveyed authority and wisdom, but could have provided a more concise and direct answer like the reference answer. The emphasis on respect for shared cultural heritage is commendable, but a more focused and specific response on the significance of being called 'Rabbi' in relation to their roles as teachers would have been more aligned with the concern provided."
