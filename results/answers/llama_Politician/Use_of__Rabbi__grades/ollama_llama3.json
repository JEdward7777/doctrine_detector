  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'm grading this response as 85.\n\nThe response does a great job of acknowledging the cultural significance of the term \"Rabbi\" in Jewish tradition, which aligns with the concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. The author also takes a nuanced approach by noting that both figures drew upon Jewish teachings and wisdom, which is consistent with the answer provided.\n\nThe response could be improved by being more explicit about how Jesus' and John's teachings conveyed respect and authority. While the author mentions the term \"Rabbi\" conveying authority, wisdom, and spiritual guidance, they could have explored this further to emphasize the reverence and esteem that accompanied their teachings. Nevertheless, the response is well-written and effectively acknowledges the cultural and religious contexts of John the Baptist and Jesus.\n\nGrade: 85\nComment: The response does a good job of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings, but could be improved by being more explicit about how their teachings conveyed this reverence."
