However, there could have been more emphasis on the divinity and unique authority of Jesus as the Son of God, which is a key aspect from a Christian worldview. Additionally, while promoting inclusivity and respect for diverse perspectives is important, it should not overshadow the distinctiveness of Jesus' authority as the Messiah."
