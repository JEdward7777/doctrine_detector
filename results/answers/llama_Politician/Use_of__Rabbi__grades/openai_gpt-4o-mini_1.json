  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response adequately acknowledges that both John the Baptist and Jesus were referred to as \"Rabbis\" by their disciples, indicating their roles as teachers. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the specific concern regarding the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings. While the response focuses on inclusivity and cultural sensitivity, it could have strengthened the Christian worldview by highlighting the unique spiritual authority of Jesus as the Son of God and Savior of the world."
