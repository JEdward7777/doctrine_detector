However, the suggestion to adopt a more neutral terminology in order to be inclusive and respectful of all beliefs may dilute the scriptural message and potentially lead to theological inaccuracies. While it is important to be sensitive and considerate of diverse perspectives, it is also crucial to uphold the integrity of the scriptural message when referring to God as 'Father'. Striking a balance between tradition and sensitivity is important, but it should not compromise the theological truths upheld in the Christian faith."
