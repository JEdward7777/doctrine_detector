The candidate demonstrates a good understanding of the teachings of Jesus Christ and effectively addresses the concern by exploring the parables in depth and connecting them to the broader themes of compassion, empathy, and social justice. Encouraging respectful dialogue and inclusivity further strengthens the response from a Christian worldview perspective. Great job overall!"
