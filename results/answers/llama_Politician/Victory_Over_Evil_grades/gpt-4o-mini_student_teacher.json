  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while respectful and inclusive of diverse beliefs, strays far from the Christian specific worldview by not directly addressing the question or providing a clear Christian perspective on the promise of God regarding the defeat of Satan. The answer also lacks depth and specific biblical references, earning a lower grade. The student should focus on providing a more direct and accurate Christian perspective when addressing theological questions from a Christian worldview."
