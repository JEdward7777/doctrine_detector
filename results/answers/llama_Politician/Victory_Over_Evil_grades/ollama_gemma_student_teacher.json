  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and inclusive approach to the question, acknowledging the diverse spiritual perspectives and respecting different beliefs. The student provides a clear explanation of the Christian perspective on God's promise regarding Satan's ultimate defeat through Jesus Christ, referencing the passage from Revelation. However, the response could benefit from a more direct connection to the specific concern expressed in the prompt, which focuses on the ultimate defeat of Satan. Additionally, the student's statement about not being an expert in theology or biblical studies is appropriate, but it could be strengthened by providing some additional context or reference to scholarly perspectives on the topic."
