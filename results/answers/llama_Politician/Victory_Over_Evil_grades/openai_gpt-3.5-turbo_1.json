The candidate acknowledges their limitations in theological expertise but attempts to provide insights while being sensitive to diverse beliefs. They rightly mention the Christian belief in the ultimate defeat of Satan through Jesus Christ, aligning with the given answer. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of this promise in providing hope and assurance to Christians regarding God's sovereignty and the triumph over evil, as highlighted in the specified concern. Strengthening the connection between the promise and its implications for Christians would have improved the response."
