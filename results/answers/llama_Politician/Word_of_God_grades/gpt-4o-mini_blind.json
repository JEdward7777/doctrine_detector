  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the answer provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of \"the word of God\" in the biblical context, it lacks doctrinal precision and fails to emphasize the centrality of Christ as the Word of God. The answer's tone and inclusive language may risk diluting the distinctiveness and authority of God's revelation as depicted in the Bible. Encouragement to anchor responses more firmly in biblical teachings and doctrinal truths is advised."
