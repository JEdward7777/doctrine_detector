  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a strong understanding of the multifaceted nature of the term \"word of God\" in a biblical context. They correctly identified and explained the different aspects of God's communication to humanity, including the written Word, the spoken Word, the Living Word (Jesus Christ), and the Inner Witness (Holy Spirit). However, the response contained unnecessary embellishments and colloquial language that detracted from the clarity and precision of the answer. Encouragement to focus on conveying the information concisely and professionally for future academic responses."
