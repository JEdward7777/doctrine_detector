However, it lacks a clear statement affirming the biblical truth that worshiping anything other than the one true God is sinful. The answer would benefit from emphasizing the importance of aligning our values and actions with the teachings of Scripture to avoid falling into idolatry. Additionally, the response could incorporate more explicitly Christian language and perspective to strengthen its connection to a Christian worldview."
