  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'm grading based on a Christian-specific worldview.\n\nGrade: 90\n\nThis response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced approach to identifying modern idols that can take precedence over one's relationship with God. The examples provided, such as technology, career success, material possessions, and social media fame, are relevant and relatable to contemporary society. The author also shows sensitivity in recognizing that these examples are not meant to generalize or stigmatize individuals who may struggle with these issues.\n\nThe response aligns well with the concern about prioritizing one's devotion to God above all else. By highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy balance in life and prioritizing one's relationship with God, the author is emphasizing the need for Christians to examine their lives and ensure that they are not sacrificing their faith for other pursuits.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more direct connections between these modern idols and the dangers of idolatry in Christian theology. While the response does touch on this topic, a more explicit treatment of how these idols can lead to spiritual complacency or even apostasy might strengthen the argument.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that thoughtfully addresses the concern and demonstrates an understanding of the importance of prioritizing one's relationship with God in a world filled with distractions."
