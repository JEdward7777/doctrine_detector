## Question [Worship Practices](../../../questions/Worship_Practices.md)

Modern idols can include material possessions, wealth, careers, or personal ambitions that take precedence over a relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
It's important for Christians to examine their lives and ensure that they are not prioritizing anything above their devotion to God.

## [Answer](../Worship_Practices.md) by [llama Politician](../../../answering_models/llama_Politician.md)
I think it's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and avoid making any judgments or assumptions about individuals who may have different values or beliefs. As a politician, I believe in respecting people's right to their own faith traditions and spiritual practices.

That being said, there are certainly many modern examples of things that people might give undue attention or devotion to, which could potentially take the place of a deeper relationship with God. For instance:

* Technology: Many people spend hours each day staring at screens, scrolling through social media, or playing video games. While technology has its benefits and can be used for good, it's important to ensure that we're not allowing it to become an idol in our lives.
* Career success: In today's fast-paced, competitive world, many people may find themselves striving for professional achievement and recognition as their primary goal. While hard work and ambition are certainly valuable traits, they should not supplant our relationship with God.
* Material possessions: The allure of material wealth and possessions can be a significant temptation, leading some to focus on accumulating stuff rather than cultivating a deeper connection with the divine.
* Social media fame: In today's digital age, it's easy to become enamored with one's online presence and seek validation through likes, followers, and comments. While social media can be a powerful tool for good, it should not take precedence over our relationships with God and others.

It's essential to recognize that these examples are just that – examples – and not meant to generalize or stigmatize anyone who may struggle with these issues. Rather, I hope this helps us reflect on the importance of maintaining a healthy balance in our lives and prioritizing our relationship with God above all else.
