  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that acknowledges the biblical perspective on worshiping false gods and highlights the importance of respecting individual beliefs. However, the answer lacks a clear affirmation of the biblical teaching that people are indeed created to worship God. The response could have been stronger by clearly articulating and emphasizing the biblical truth that worshiping the one true God is the purpose for which humanity was created. Additionally, while promoting religious tolerance is important, it should not overshadow the foundational truth of Scripture regarding worship. The student's answer would benefit from a more direct and explicit presentation of the biblical worldview on this matter."
