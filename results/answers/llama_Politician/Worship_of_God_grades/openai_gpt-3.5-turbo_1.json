  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical perspective on false gods and idolatry. The writer effectively relates the concern about the importance of worshiping the true God to the biblical teachings provided. The response could be strengthened by more directly tying the content to the concern raised and by offering a clearer stance on the issue rather than presenting a neutral perspective."
