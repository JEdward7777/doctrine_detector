The writer effectively connects the concept of zeal to biblical examples, demonstrating a solid understanding of the theological significance. The emphasis on balancing zeal with empathy and understanding aligns well with Christian teachings on love and humility. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the direct biblical context of zeal in relation to obeying God and promoting good causes."
