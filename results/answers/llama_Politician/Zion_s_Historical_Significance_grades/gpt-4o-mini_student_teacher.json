  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response touches on some aspects of the significance of Mount Zion in relation to King David, emphasizing its symbolic and metaphorical connotations. However, the student's approach of being non-denominational and culturally-sensitive, while well-intentioned, deviates from the specific Christian worldview required for this question. The biblical narrative and the connection to key figures in Scripture should be emphasized more clearly and explicitly. The response lacks a direct reference to the capture of Mount Zion by King David from the Jebusites, which is a crucial historical event in relation to King David. The focus on inclusivity and respect, while important, detracts from the specificity and depth expected in a Christian worldview response to this question."
