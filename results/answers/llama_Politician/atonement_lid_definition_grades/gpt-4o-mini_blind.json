However, the explanation lacks depth and clarity regarding the doctrinal understanding from a Christian worldview. The discussion tends to focus more on general perspectives and cultural aspects rather than delving into the specific theological implications of the atonement lid within the Christian faith. It would have been beneficial to explore how the atonement lid prefigured Christ's sacrificial atonement on the cross, emphasizing the central role of Jesus in providing forgiveness and reconciliation between humanity and God. Additionally, a more explicit connection to Christian theology could have elevated the overall analysis of this sacred biblical symbol."
