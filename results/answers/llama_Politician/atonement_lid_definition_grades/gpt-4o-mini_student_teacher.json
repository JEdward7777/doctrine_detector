  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's response showed respect for religious beliefs and acknowledged the importance of the atonement lid, it lacked a Christian-specific worldview in understanding the symbolism and significance of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament. The answer did not directly address the critical aspect of the high priest's role in meeting with Yahweh on behalf of the people, which is central to Christian theology and understanding of atonement. Encouragement to further integrate Christian perspectives and theological depth would enhance the response."
