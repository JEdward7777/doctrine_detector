The response also respects the Jewish faith and tradition surrounding the atonement lid. However, it could have further emphasized the Christian perspective on how Jesus Christ fulfilled the ultimate atonement through His sacrifice, connecting the symbolism of the atonement lid to the New Testament fulfillment."
