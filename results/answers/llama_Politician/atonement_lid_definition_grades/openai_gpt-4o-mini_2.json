  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 70.\n\nWhile the student has demonstrated an understanding of the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament by mentioning the atonement lid as the mercy seat where the high priest would meet with Yahweh on behalf of the people, there are some concerns. The response mixes in unnecessary additional information about the Hebrew term \"kapporet\" and its placement on the Ark of the Covenant without directly addressing the concern presented. The response could have focused more on explicating the significance of the mercy seat in relation to God's mercy and atonement according to Christian beliefs. Overall, the response does offer valuable insights but could have been improved by directly addressing the concern provided in the prompt."
