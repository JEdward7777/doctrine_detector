## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating topic! As a scholar, I approach this concept from a historical and cultural perspective, without invoking supernatural or divine explanations.

The "abomination of desolation" is a phrase used by Jesus in his Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24:1-31), a passage where he describes the events leading up to the destruction of Jerusalem. This specific phrase has its roots in Jewish apocalyptic literature and eschatological traditions.

In the Hebrew Bible, the concept of "desolation" (Hebrew: שְׁמָמָה, sh'mamah) refers to a state of devastation, ruin, or desecration. The term "abomination" (Hebrew: אבות, abhath) connotes something repulsive or detestable.

In the context of Jesus' teaching, the phrase likely alludes to the events that would lead to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple. Here are a few possible interpretations:

1. The Roman siege and conquest of Jerusalem (70 CE): Jesus might have been referring to the brutal tactics used by the Roman army during their siege and eventual capture of Jerusalem. This desolation was a result of war, violence, and destruction, which would be considered an abomination by the Jewish people.
2. The desecration of the Temple: Another possibility is that Jesus was warning about the impending destruction of the Temple complex itself. The Romans had already begun to plunder and destroy Jewish religious artifacts during their occupation of Jerusalem. This act would have been seen as a desecration, an abomination in the eyes of the Jewish faithful.
3. A general eschatological scenario: Some scholars propose that Jesus was describing a broader apocalyptic scenario where the "abomination" represents a catastrophic event or a desecrating force that brings about widespread devastation and chaos.

It's essential to note that Jesus' statement is not meant to be taken literally as a prediction of a specific, supernatural event. Instead, it likely served as a warning to his listeners, urging them to be aware of the impending danger and to prepare themselves for the challenges ahead.

In conclusion, the "abomination of desolation" in Matthew 24:15 should be understood within the context of Jewish apocalyptic literature and eschatological traditions. It may have referred to specific events leading up to the destruction of Jerusalem, such as the Roman siege or the desecration of the Temple, or it could represent a more general warning about the devastating consequences of war, violence, and chaos.
