However, the answer falls short in acknowledging and exploring the significance of this phrase in light of Jesus' divinity and the prophetic nature of his words. It lacks a Christian worldview perspective and fails to consider the spiritual implications and fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus' teachings. Emphasizing the supernatural and divine aspects of Jesus' message would have strengthened the analysis."
