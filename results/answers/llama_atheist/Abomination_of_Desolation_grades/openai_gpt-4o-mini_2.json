While the scholar's approach is commendable in understanding the phrase from a secular viewpoint, the exclusion of any acknowledgment of the spiritual or divine significance of defiling God's sacred places does not align with a Christian worldview. Christians believe in the sacredness of God's dwelling and the importance of heeding prophetic warnings in the Bible regarding such matters. The response falls short in addressing these essential Christian perspectives."
