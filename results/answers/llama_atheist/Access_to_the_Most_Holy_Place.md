## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question about the ancient Israelites! As a scholar, I'm happy to provide you with an evidence-based answer.

The "most holy place" refers to the Holy of Holies within the Tabernacle, which was later replaced by the Temple in Jerusalem. According to the Hebrew Bible (Leviticus 16:1-34), only two individuals were permitted to enter this sacred space:

1. The High Priest: Once a year, on Yom Kippur, the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies to make atonement for his own sins and those of the people.
2. God Himself: According to the biblical account, God's presence dwelled in the Holy of Holies (Exodus 25:8-9).

The restriction on entering the most holy place was crucial for several reasons:

1. Impurity: The Israelites believed that any ordinary person who entered the Holy of Holies would be defiled by the divine presence. This fear of impurity led to the stringent restrictions on access.
2. Atonement: The High Priest's annual entry into the Holy of Holies was a crucial part of the atonement process, ensuring the people's sins were forgiven and the nation's spiritual well-being was maintained.
3. Separation from the profane world: By restricting access to the most holy place, the Israelites created a clear distinction between the sacred (the Temple) and the profane (the outside world). This separation underscored the importance of separating the divine from human affairs.

In summary, only the High Priest, on behalf of the people, and God Himself were permitted to enter the "most holy place" due to concerns about impurity, atonement, and the need for spiritual separation.
