  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer regarding who was permitted to enter the 'most holy place' in the Tabernacle/Temple and why this restriction was important. They accurately highlighted the roles of the High Priest and God Himself in entering this sacred space, and effectively explained the reasons behind the restriction - impurity, atonement, and separation from the profane world. However, they could have placed more emphasis on the primary reason stated in the reference answer, which is to maintain the holiness of God's presence and to represent the people before God in the most sacred area. Overall, a strong answer with a Christian worldview perspective."
