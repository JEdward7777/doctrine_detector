The student's approach of disregarding religious teachings and referring to them as \"religious dogma\" showcases a bias against faith-based beliefs. A more balanced analysis, considering both secular and Christian perspectives on marriage and unfaithfulness, would result in a more comprehensive and nuanced discussion."
