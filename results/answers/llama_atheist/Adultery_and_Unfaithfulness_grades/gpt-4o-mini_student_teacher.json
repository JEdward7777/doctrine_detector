  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would assign a grade of 20 to this student's response.\n\nWhile the student makes some valid points about the cultural and historical context of fidelity in relationships, they completely dismiss the given concern related to the importance of loyalty and faithfulness in both spiritual and marital commitments. The response fails to engage with the Christian worldview presented in the reference answer, which emphasizes the significance of fidelity in marriage as paralleling faithfulness to God. The student's atheistic perspective and dismissal of religious teachings without engaging with the specific concern presented are inconsistent with the requested Christian worldview. Therefore, a low grade is warranted."
