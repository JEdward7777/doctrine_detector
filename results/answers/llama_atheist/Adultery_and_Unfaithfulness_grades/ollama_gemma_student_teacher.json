  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of \"unfaithfulness\" in marriage from a secular perspective. They acknowledge the cultural and historical contexts of the term and challenge the idea of its absoluteness. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the connection between the concept of faithfulness in marriage and Christian beliefs."
