  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10/100\n\nComment: This response completely dismisses the importance of loyalty and faithfulness in both spiritual and marital commitments. It focuses solely on a secular perspective without addressing the concern regarding the significance of these values in Christian worldview. Furthermore, it undermines the gravity of adultery within marriage by reducing it to a mere cultural construct. More emphasis on the relational and spiritual implications of unfaithfulness in light of Christian beliefs is needed for a higher grade."
