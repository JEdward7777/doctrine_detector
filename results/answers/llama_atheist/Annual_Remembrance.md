As a secular scholar, I'll provide you with a historical and cultural analysis of the Passover celebration without relying on religious beliefs or supernatural explanations.

According to the biblical account in Exodus 12:1-14, Passover was instituted by God as a memorial to the Israelites' liberation from slavery in Egypt. The commandment to celebrate Passover annually was given to the Israelites after they left Egypt and entered the Promised Land.

Historically, it's likely that the early Israelites celebrated various spring festivals or harvest festivals, which were common practices among ancient Near Eastern cultures. The Exodus story may have been woven into these existing celebrations as a way to emphasize the Israelites' unique experience of liberation from slavery.

The biblical account suggests that the Passover was initially observed by the Israelites during their time in Egypt (Exodus 12:14), and later became an annual observance after they entered the Promised Land. This may have been done to:

1. Commemorate the Israelites' freedom from slavery: By celebrating Passover, the Israelites could recall and reenact the story of their liberation from Egyptian bondage.
2. Honor God's deliverance: The biblical narrative portrays God as the one who freed the Israelites from slavery, so observing Passover would have served as a way to express gratitude and loyalty to this deity.
3. Celebrate the spring harvest: As an agricultural society, the early Israelites may have seen the spring season as a time of renewal and harvest. The Passover celebration could have been tied to these seasonal events, with the sacrifice of the lamb representing the end of winter's scarcity and the beginning of new life.

In terms of cultural significance, the Passover celebration likely played a role in reinforcing social bonds and community identity among the early Israelites. By gathering together to celebrate this event, families and communities could reaffirm their shared history, traditions, and values.

It's important to note that these interpretations are based on historical and cultural analysis, rather than religious beliefs or supernatural explanations. As a secular scholar, I'm focused on understanding the Passover celebration within its historical and cultural context, without relying on divine intervention or revelation.
