The answer misses the theological aspect of Passover as a shadow and type of Christ's sacrifice for sin, emphasizing instead historical and cultural perspectives without acknowledging the religious foundations. It is important to also consider the spiritual implications and God's redemptive plan when discussing the purpose of Passover in a Biblical context."
