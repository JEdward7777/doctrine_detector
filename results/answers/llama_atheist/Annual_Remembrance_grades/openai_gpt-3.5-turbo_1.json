As a Christian, the significance of Passover goes beyond historical and cultural context; it is deeply tied to the relationship between God and His people, emphasizing the need to remember His faithfulness and deliverance. The response fails to acknowledge the spiritual significance of Passover in Christian belief, resulting in a limited perspective from a Christian worldview."
