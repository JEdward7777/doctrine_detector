In Christian faith, the act of celebrating Passover serves as a significant remembrance of God's deliverance of the Israelites, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ. It is crucial to consider this Christian perspective when discussing the significance of Passover, as the remembrance of God's interventions and faithfulness is foundational to the Christian worldview."
