The explanation lacks acknowledgment of the spiritual and theological implications of Passover as a symbol of God's deliverance and victory, which are central themes in Christian understanding. From a Christian worldview, the importance of Passover goes beyond historical and cultural observations to encompass God's faithfulness, salvation, and the need for continual remembrance of His redemptive acts."
