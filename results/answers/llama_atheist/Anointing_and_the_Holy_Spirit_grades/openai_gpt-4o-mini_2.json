The secular analysis and interpretation provided lack depth in linking anointing with the empowerment of Christians through the Holy Spirit within a Christian theological framework. There is room for improvement in explicitly connecting anointing with divine empowerment and illustrating how this aligns with Christian beliefs about the work of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives."
