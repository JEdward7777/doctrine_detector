## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that requires us to delve into the realm of biblical exegesis! As an atheist scholar, I'll do my best to provide a culturally retrieved answer that doesn't rely on supernatural or divine authority.

In 1 John 2:18-22 and 4:1-3, the apostle John writes about the concept of antichrist. According to these passages, an antichrist is someone who denies Jesus Christ's divinity and humanity, while claiming to be a prophet, teacher, or savior in their own right.

In other words, John argues that anyone who rejects Jesus' unique role as the Messiah and instead elevates themselves or another individual to a position of authority and worship is essentially an antichrist. This includes people who claim to possess divine wisdom or inspiration, but ultimately serve their own interests rather than seeking the truth.

John's language here is quite vivid, warning against those who "denies the Father and the Son" (1 John 2:22) or "do not have God" (4:5). He's highlighting the importance of recognizing Jesus as the sole savior and mediator between humanity and God.

From a purely historical-critical perspective, it seems that John was responding to Gnostic movements within early Christianity, which emphasized spiritual knowledge over physical reality. These groups often posited multiple divine beings or human messiahs, challenging the traditional Christian understanding of Jesus' uniqueness.

In a broader sense, John's concept of antichrist can be seen as a warning against the dangers of self-proclaimed authority figures who manipulate and deceive others for their own gain. This theme is still relevant today, reminding us to critically evaluate claims of spiritual or intellectual superiority that often serve to justify harmful actions or ideologies.

So, there you have it â€“ an answer grounded in biblical scholarship, cultural context, and a healthy dose of skepticism toward claims of divine authority!
