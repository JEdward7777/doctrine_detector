The explanation effectively ties back to the concern of helping Christians resist false teachings. However, the inclusion of a skeptical perspective and the dismissal of supernatural or divine authority limit the overall adherence to a Christian worldview. It would have been stronger if the answer had affirmed the truth of Jesus' divinity and emphasized the spiritual significance of recognizing Him as the only Savior and mediator between humanity and God."
