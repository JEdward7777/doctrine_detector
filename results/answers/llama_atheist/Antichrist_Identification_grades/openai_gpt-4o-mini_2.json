While it acknowledges the deceptive nature of antichrists in denying Jesus' divinity and humanity, it lacks a clear emphasis on the significance of this knowledge in guarding against false teachings and preserving true Christian beliefs. A stronger connection between the identified traits of antichrists and the practical application for Christians in discerning and standing against false teachings would have enhanced the response."
