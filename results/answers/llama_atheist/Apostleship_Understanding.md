## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that has sparked debate and inquiry for centuries! As an atheist scholar, I approach this inquiry from a historical and cultural perspective.

The account of Jesus sending out his apostles to spread the gospel can be seen as a pivotal moment in early Christianity. This event is recorded in the Gospels of Matthew (10:1-42), Mark (6:7-13), Luke (9:1-6, 10:1-24), and John (17:18). The significance of this episode lies not only in its role as a foundation for early Christian missionary activity but also in its reflection of the cultural and social context of ancient Palestine.

In the ancient Mediterranean world, the sending out of disciples or emissaries was a common practice among itinerant teachers, prophets, and charismatic leaders. This custom is evident in Jewish traditions, such as the sending out of 70 disciples by Jesus (Luke 10:1-24), as well as in Greek and Roman literature.

Jesus' instruction to his apostles to "go nowhere among the Gentiles, and enter no town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of Israel" (Matthew 10:5-6) highlights the initial focus on Jewish converts. This emphasis is consistent with Jesus' ministry, which primarily targeted Jews.

The commissioning of the apostles can also be seen as a manifestation of Jesus' authority and power. By empowering his disciples to perform miracles, heal the sick, and proclaim the kingdom, Jesus demonstrated his divine mandate. This episode serves as a demonstration of Jesus' messianic claims, emphasizing his role as the one who would bring salvation to Israel.

Furthermore, the sending out of the apostles reflects the cultural significance of community and social networks in ancient Palestine. The apostles were instructed to "eat what is set before you" (Matthew 10:8) and "stay in the same house, eating and drinking whatever they provide" (Mark 6:11). This emphasis on hospitality and reciprocity underscores the importance of relationships and community in Mediterranean societies.

In conclusion, the significance of Jesus sending out his apostles to spread the gospel lies not only in its role as a foundation for early Christian missionary activity but also in its reflection of the cultural and social context of ancient Palestine. The episode highlights Jesus' authority, emphasizes the initial focus on Jewish converts, and underscores the importance of community and relationships in Mediterranean societies.

(Please note that my analysis is from an atheist perspective, focusing on the historical and cultural significance of the event rather than its theological implications.)
