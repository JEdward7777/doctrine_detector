  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough analysis of the historical and cultural context surrounding the sending out of the apostles by Jesus, their answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview in addressing the significance of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission. The discussion on theological implications and the divine authority bestowed upon the apostles is missing. Encouragement to incorporate a Christian perspective to enhance their understanding would be beneficial."
