  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response adequately addresses the concern of understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission, but falls short in fully capturing the theological significance of Jesus' commissioning of his apostles. While it provides a solid historical and cultural analysis of the episode, it does not explicitly connect this event to the broader mission of spreading the gospel.\n\nThe response's focus on the cultural and social context of ancient Palestine is commendable, but could be further developed to explore how these factors influenced the apostles' missionary endeavors. Additionally, the response could have more explicitly connected Jesus' commissioning of his apostles to the Great Commission, highlighting its importance in the establishment and expansion of the early church.\n\nOverall, while this response provides a good foundation for understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission, it could benefit from further theological reflection and connection-making to truly demonstrate mastery of the topic."
