However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern about the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission. While the response discusses the significance of the apostles' mission, it does not explicitly connect it to the Great Commission or delve into the theological implications of their role as representatives of Christ. Additionally, from a Christian worldview perspective, the response does not engage with the spiritual aspect of the apostles' mission and their position as authoritative messengers of the gospel."
