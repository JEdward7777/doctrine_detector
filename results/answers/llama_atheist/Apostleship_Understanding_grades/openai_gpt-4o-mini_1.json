However, the primary focus is on the cultural context and human dynamics involved, rather than on the theological implications or the divine authority behind the apostles' mission. From a Christian worldview, the response lacks a recognition of the spiritual significance and divine calling of the apostles, as well as the foundational role of their mission in spreading the Gospel message."
