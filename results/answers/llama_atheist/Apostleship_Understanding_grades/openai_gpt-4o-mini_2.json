While the response did not explicitly address the theological implications or the specific term \"Great Commission,\" it effectively explored the context and implications of apostleship in spreading the gospel message. The inclusion of relevant biblical passages and cultural practices added depth to the discussion. However, from a Christian worldview, connecting the apostles' mission to the Great Commission and the broader theological implications of their role could have further enriched the response.\n"
