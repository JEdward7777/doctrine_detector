  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and well-articulated response on how Christians can apply the principle of reconciliation in their relationships with others. They presented various practical ways such as seeking forgiveness, mending relationships within and beyond the faith community, practicing self-reflection, embracing enemy love, and seeking divine guidance. While the student's answer was comprehensive and insightful, it lacked a direct focus on the Christian-specific aspect of reconciliation through Jesus and God's compassionate love. Encouraging the student to further emphasize the unique Christian worldview and scriptural foundations would strengthen their response."
