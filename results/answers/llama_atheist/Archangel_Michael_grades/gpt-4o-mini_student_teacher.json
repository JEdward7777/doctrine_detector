  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided the correct answer by correctly identifying Michael as the only angel referred to as an 'archangel' in the Bible. However, the response showed a lack of recognition of the importance of this identification within a Christian worldview, as highlighted in the concern provided. Encouraging the student to consider the significance of Michael's role in spiritual warfare and intercession would enhance their understanding and application of biblical knowledge."
