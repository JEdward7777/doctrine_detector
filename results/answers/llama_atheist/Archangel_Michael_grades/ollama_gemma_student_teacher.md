A question that has no bearing on my personal beliefs or lack thereof! As a scholar, I shall provide you with the answer without any bias.

According to the Bible, the archangel Michael is the only angel referred to as such. This can be found in Jude 1:9, where it says, "Yet Michael the archangel, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for speaking against him but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'"
