According to the Bible, the archangel Michael is the only angel referred to as such. This can be found in Jude 1:9, where it says, "Yet Michael the archangel, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for speaking against him but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'"

Comment: The response accurately identifies that Michael is the only angel referred to as an archangel in the Bible. However, it lacks depth in exploring how recognizing Michael's unique position can influence one's understanding of spiritual warfare and intercession from a Christian perspective. Expanding on this insight would improve the response.
