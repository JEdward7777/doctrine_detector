However, as an atheist scholar, the answer dismisses the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God from a Christian worldview. The concern raised specifically asks for an understanding of these aspects, which the response fails to address adequately. From a Christian perspective, acknowledging the divine significance and presence associated with the most holy place is essential in interpreting the placement of the Ark of the Covenant."
