However, as an atheist scholar, the writer fails to fully address the significance of the most holy place as the dwelling of God's presence. From a Christian perspective, understanding the presence of God in the most holy place is essential and integral to the significance of the Ark of the Covenant. The response lacks a Christian worldview in interpreting the sacredness and importance of the Ark's location within the Tabernacle."
