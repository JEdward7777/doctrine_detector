  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the significance of the Ark of the Covenant within the biblical narrative. They provide a well-researched and articulate analysis of its religious, historical, and cultural significance. The student's secular approach to the analysis is commendable, providing a balanced and nuanced perspective on the artifact's significance. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview and its interpretation of the Ark's significance."
