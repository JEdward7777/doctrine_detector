However, while the response acknowledges the importance of the Ark in symbolizing God's presence and covenant with Israel, it lacks explicit reference to the significance of God's laws and His relationship with His chosen people through the Ark. The response could have further emphasized the covenantal aspect and the importance of following God's laws as a reflection of the relationship between God and His people."
