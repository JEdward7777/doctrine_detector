While it presents a comprehensive understanding of the Ark's role, it lacks a explicit recognition of the divine origin and authority behind the laws contained within the Ark and the covenant between God and His chosen people. In a Christian worldview, it is essential to emphasize the divine nature of God's laws and the covenant relationship rather than purely viewing it through a historical or cultural lens."
