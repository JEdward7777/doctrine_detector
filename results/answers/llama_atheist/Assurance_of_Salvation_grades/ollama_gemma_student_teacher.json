They effectively balance critical analysis with sensitivity towards religious beliefs. The answer challenges traditional assumptions about the literal nature of biblical narratives while acknowledging the emotional and psychological significance of faith. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit statement acknowledging the personal experience of believers and their faith in Jesus Christ as a source of assurance."
