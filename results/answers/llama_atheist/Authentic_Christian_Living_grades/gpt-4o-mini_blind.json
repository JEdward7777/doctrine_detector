  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a thoughtful and well-developed response to the question by delving into the concept of agap\u0113 love as described in Romans 12:9. The student correctly highlights the importance of authenticity, humility, and consistency in embodying this type of love and avoiding hypocrisy. The answer could be improved by directly quoting or referencing the actual verse for more doctrinal accuracy and by incorporating more specific Christian principles and teachings to deepen the analysis. Overall, a strong effort with room for minor enhancements."
