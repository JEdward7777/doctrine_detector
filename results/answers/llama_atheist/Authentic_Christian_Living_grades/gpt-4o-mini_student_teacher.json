  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response, exploring the concept of love as described in Romans 12:9. They highlighted the importance of authenticity, humility, and consistency in demonstrating love to avoid hypocrisy. While the student's answer was insightful and reflective, it could have been more directly tied to the reference answer provided by focusing on the specific aspect of genuine and sincere love without hypocrisy. Emphasizing this core aspect of the verse would have strengthened their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
