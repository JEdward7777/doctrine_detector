  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed analysis of the concept of divine authority from a cultural and historical perspective, but failed to address the given concern from a Christian worldview. The answer lacks a clear understanding of divine authority as originating from God and guiding believers in their faith journey. Additionally, the student's atheistic perspective influenced the response, leading to a lack of alignment with the Christian-specific worldview."
