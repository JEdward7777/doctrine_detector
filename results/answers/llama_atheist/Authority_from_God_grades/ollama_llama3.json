It also acknowledges the potential implications and criticisms of this concept. However, while it provides a nuanced analysis, it doesn't directly address the concern about understanding divine authority helping believers discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey.\n\nThe response could be improved by more explicitly exploring how divine authority is understood to guide moral and spiritual decisions within religious traditions, and how this relates to the concern about maintaining obedience. Nevertheless, the response's strength lies in its thoughtful analysis of the concept and its potential problems, making it a solid effort overall."
