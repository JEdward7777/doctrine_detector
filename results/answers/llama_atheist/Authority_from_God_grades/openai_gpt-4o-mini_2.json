However, the perspective of the atheist author is maintained throughout, and while the understanding of divine authority is presented objectively, the response lacks engagement with the concern highlighted about how understanding divine authority helps believers discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. From a Christian worldview, divine authority is central to understanding God's will and guidance for believers, which is not fully reflected in the response."
