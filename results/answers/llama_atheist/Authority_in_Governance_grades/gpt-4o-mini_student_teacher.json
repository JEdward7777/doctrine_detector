  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response is well-researched and provides a good understanding of the biblical perspective on governance and the relationship between rulers and citizens. However, the student's inclusion of their personal atheistic perspective detracts from the focus on biblical teachings. The student could improve by maintaining a consistent Christian worldview throughout the response and focusing on the specific concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey."
