  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response goes beyond just affirming that governing rulers have been established by God, which aligns with the provided answer. It provides additional biblical passages to support the concept of government being accountable to God and responsible for justice. The response also highlights the importance of citizens having responsibilities, including contributing to the common good through civic engagement.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because some parts of the response feel more like an academic analysis rather than a direct address to the concern about understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. For instance, the section that says \"As an atheistic scholar, I must admit...\" seems out of place in this context.\n\nAdditionally, while the response provides some biblical passages to support its claims, it does not delve as deeply into the implications of these passages for understanding our responsibility to obey governing authorities. Overall, a strong effort, but could be more focused on addressing the specific concern."
