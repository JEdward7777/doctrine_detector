The analysis adequately addresses the concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. However, the inclusion of the atheistic scholar's perspective at the end detracts slightly from the focus on the Christian worldview and could have been omitted to maintain consistency throughout the response."
