The analysis of relevant biblical passages supports the notion that rulers possess authority from God. The response could have delved deeper into the significance of obeying and respecting this God-ordained structure of authority, connecting it more explicitly to the responsibility of citizens to obey and submit to governing authorities. Additionally, the mention of atheistic perspective at the end could be viewed as somewhat distracting from the Christian worldview analysis."
