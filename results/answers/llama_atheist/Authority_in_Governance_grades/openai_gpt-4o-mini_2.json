  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough exploration of biblical teachings related to governance, specifically addressing the authority of governing rulers as established by God and the responsibility of citizens to obey. The analysis of selected passages and the application of biblical principles to governance were insightful and well-supported. The response demonstrated a solid understanding of the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey as outlined in Romans 13:1-2. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the importance of obedience and submission to God's established authorities throughout the response to better address the specified concern."
