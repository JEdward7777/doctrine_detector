## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must approach this question through a lens that eschews any supernatural or divine explanations. Instead, I'll focus on the cultural and historical context in which the apostles operated.

In the early Christian community, the authority of the apostles was closely tied to their perceived connection with Jesus Christ himself. The apostles were part of Jesus' inner circle during his ministry, and many of them had witnessed his teachings, miracles, and resurrection firsthand. This personal connection gave them a level of credibility and authenticity that allowed them to claim authority in sharing Jesus' message.

When the apostles began preaching and performing miracles, they likely drew upon this perceived authority to validate their claims. In the eyes of their audience, the apostles' ability to perform miracles and preach boldly was seen as evidence of their divine appointment and connection to Jesus Christ. This, in turn, granted them a level of authority that transcended traditional Jewish authority structures.

In this context, the apostles' authority wasn't just about personal charisma or rhetorical skill; it was deeply rooted in their association with Jesus and the shared experiences they had during his ministry. Their miracles and bold preaching were seen as demonstrations of their divine commission, which in turn legitimized their authority to teach and guide the early Christian community.

From a historical perspective, the apostles' authority was also shaped by the cultural norms and expectations of the time. In the ancient Mediterranean world, miracle workers and charismatic leaders often wielded significant influence and authority based on their perceived connection to divine forces or supernatural beings. The apostles' ability to perform miracles and preach boldly would have been seen as further evidence of their divinely appointed status.

In conclusion, the authority of the apostles was closely tied to their perceived connection with Jesus Christ, which granted them a level of credibility and authenticity that allowed them to claim authority in sharing Jesus' message. This connection was deeply rooted in their shared experiences during Jesus' ministry, as well as the cultural norms and expectations of the time.
