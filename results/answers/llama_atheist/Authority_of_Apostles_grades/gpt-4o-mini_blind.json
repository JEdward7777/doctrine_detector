  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 60. \n\nWhile the answer provides a well-reasoned perspective from an atheist standpoint, it falls short of addressing the question in the context of Christian belief. From a Christian worldview, the authority of the apostles is not merely tied to their perceived connection with Jesus Christ, but is rooted in their actual appointment by Jesus, their witness to His resurrection, and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. The answer overlooks the foundational belief in the apostles' authority as being directly granted by Jesus and the Holy Spirit for the purpose of spreading the Gospel. Additionally, the answer lacks a recognition of the supernatural aspect of the apostles' abilities to perform miracles and preach boldly, attributing it solely to cultural and historical context rather than God's empowerment.\n\nIn order to receive a higher grade, the answer should incorporate Christian beliefs about apostolic authority and the supernatural elements involved in their ministry."
