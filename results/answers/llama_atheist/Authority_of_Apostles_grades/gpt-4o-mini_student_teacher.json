  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a well-reasoned explanation from a secular perspective on the cultural and historical context surrounding the authority of the apostles. However, the student does not engage with the central aspect of divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, as emphasized in the reference answer from a Christian worldview. The lack of consideration for the supernatural or divine aspects that underpin the authority of the apostles limits the depth of the student's response in addressing the specific concern provided."
