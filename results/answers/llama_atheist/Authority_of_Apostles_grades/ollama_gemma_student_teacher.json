They provide a thorough analysis of the cultural and historical context in which the apostles operated, highlighting the significance of their personal connection to Jesus Christ and the influence of cultural norms. However, the answer lacks a clear acknowledgment of the supernatural or divine aspects of the apostles' authority, as specified in the concern."
