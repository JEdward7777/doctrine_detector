  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nWhile the response does touch on some aspects related to the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles, it primarily focuses on their human connection with Jesus Christ, cultural context, and historical norms. While these factors are important in understanding the apostles' ministry, they do not directly address the concern of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles.\n\nThe response does mention miracles and bold preaching as demonstrations of the apostles' divine commission, but it does not explicitly discuss how God empowered them for ministry or what specific authority was given to them by Jesus. The answer is more focused on the human factors that contributed to the apostles' authority rather than the direct divine empowerment.\n\nTo improve this response, the writer could have directly addressed the concern of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles, providing evidence from Scripture or historical records that supports their divine commission for ministry."
