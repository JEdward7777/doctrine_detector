  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and well-reasoned perspective on the authority of the apostles from a historical and cultural standpoint, acknowledging the significance of their connection to Jesus Christ and the cultural context of the time. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry as specified. The response could have integrated more explicitly how this divine empowerment influenced and shaped the authority of the apostles, aligning more closely with the provided answer and concern."
