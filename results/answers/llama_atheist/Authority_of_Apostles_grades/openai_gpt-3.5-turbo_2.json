While the explanation did not directly address the divine empowerment and authority given to the apostles by Jesus, it effectively showcased how their association with Jesus and experiences during his ministry influenced their credibility and authenticity within the early Christian community. A stronger integration of the divine empowerment aspect would have enhanced the analysis, but overall, the response demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
