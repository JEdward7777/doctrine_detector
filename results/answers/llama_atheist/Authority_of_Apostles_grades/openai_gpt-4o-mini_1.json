While the perspective is from an atheist viewpoint, the analysis effectively explores how the apostles' perceived authority could be rooted in their association with Jesus. However, the response falls short of fully addressing the concern of divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, as it focuses more on the cultural and historical factors rather than acknowledging the supernatural empowerment from God as the source of their authority."
