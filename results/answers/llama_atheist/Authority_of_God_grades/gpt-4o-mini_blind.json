  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the term \"Yahweh of Hosts\" and its significance in the context of ancient Near Eastern cosmology. The response correctly outlines how this title emphasizes God's authority over spiritual beings and the entire cosmos. The analysis could be enhanced by incorporating more direct references to specific biblical passages that use the term \"Yahweh of Hosts\" and delving deeper into the theological implications of God's authority over spiritual beings within Christian doctrine. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated, but deeper scriptural and doctrinal exploration would enhance the response."
