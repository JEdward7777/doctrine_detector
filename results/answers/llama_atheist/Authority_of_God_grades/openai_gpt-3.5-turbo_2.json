  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"Yahweh of Hosts\" in its ancient Near Eastern context, emphasizing God's supreme authority over spiritual beings and the cosmos. The student effectively connects the term to the concept of God's omnipotence and control, demonstrating a clear understanding of how this knowledge can deepen faith and trust in God. The response could have further highlighted the importance of recognizing God's authority in relation to personal faith and daily lives, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern provided."
