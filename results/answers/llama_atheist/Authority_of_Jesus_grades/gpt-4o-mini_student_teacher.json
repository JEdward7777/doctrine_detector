  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough analysis of the title \"King of the Jews\" from both Jewish and cultural perspectives, the answer lacks acknowledgment of Jesus' divine authority over all creation. Understanding Jesus' authority as King goes beyond mere cultural or historical significance; it is foundational to acknowledging His sovereignty in believers' lives. The response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Jesus' kingship and its impact on believers' understanding of His authority."
