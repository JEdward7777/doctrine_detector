While the explanation is detailed and insightful, it falls short of acknowledging Jesus' authority as a divine mandate that transcends cultural interpretations. The perspective presented leans heavily on cultural and historical contexts rather than recognizing Jesus' authority as rooted in His divine kingship over all creation. It lacks a recognition of the spiritual truth that believers hold regarding Jesus' sovereignty in their lives, which is fundamental to a Christian worldview."
