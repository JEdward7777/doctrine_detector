  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough examination of the biblical basis for parental authority over children, they missed addressing the core Christian principle of obedience and authority within the family dynamic. The student's response lacked direct reference to Ephesians 6:1-3, which clearly outlines the command for children to obey their parents. To improve the grade, the student should have connected their analysis to this foundational biblical passage to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the Christian perspective on parental authority."
