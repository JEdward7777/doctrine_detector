## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
What a fascinating topic! As an atheist scholar, I must approach this question from a more nuanced perspective, acknowledging that the attribution of authorship is not as clear-cut as we might like.

Traditionally, biblical scholars have attributed many of the psalms to King David, who is said to have written 73 of them. However, it's essential to note that this attribution is not universally accepted among scholars today. The Hebrew Bible itself does not explicitly state which authors wrote each psalm.

That being said, some psalms do bear inscriptions indicating their authorship. For instance, Psalm 120-134 are ascribed to the "sons of Korah," who were likely a group of Levitical singers or musicians. Other psalms, such as Psalms 2, 12, and 44, mention King David by name.

Some scholars have proposed that the Psalms were compiled over an extended period, with various authors contributing to the collection. For example, some argue that the wisdom psalms (e.g., Psalms 37, 49, 73) reflect a later, more sophisticated literary style, which might suggest a different authorship.

In any case, it's crucial to recognize that the Psalms themselves contain no explicit claims of authorship. The ancient Israelites likely viewed these poems as part of a larger, collective tradition, rather than attributing them to individual authors.

As an atheist scholar, I'm drawn to exploring the historical and cultural contexts in which these texts were composed. By examining the literary styles, themes, and motifs within the Psalms, we can gain a deeper understanding of the people who wrote (or contributed to) these remarkable works.
