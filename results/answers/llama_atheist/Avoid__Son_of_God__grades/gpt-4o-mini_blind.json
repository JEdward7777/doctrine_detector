  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the cultural implications of translating the term \"Son of God\" into polytheistic contexts. The alternatives provided are respectful and offer nuanced ways to convey the original meaning without causing unnecessary confusion. However, one area for improvement could be to emphasize the unique and foundational Christian doctrine of Jesus as the Son of God, ensuring that while being culturally sensitive, the core theological truth is not compromised or diluted. Overall, a well-reasoned response with valuable insights."
