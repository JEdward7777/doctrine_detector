  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student demonstrates a good understanding of the potential cultural misunderstandings surrounding the term \"Son of God,\" their proposed solutions involve altering the translation of a fundamental Christian doctrine. The Christian worldview emphasizes the unique relationship between Jesus as the Son of God and God the Father, a concept central to Christian theology. Instead of avoiding the term, it is more appropriate to provide context and explanation to ensure accurate understanding without compromising the doctrinal significance. The student's consideration of cultural sensitivity is commendable, but their proposed alternatives stray too far from the original meaning of \"Son of God\" in a Christian context."
