  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response acknowledges the concern about avoidance leading to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings, and it provides alternative translations that are culturally sensitive and accurate in conveying the original meaning. The writer also recognizes the importance of balancing accuracy with cultural sensitivity in translations.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the opposing view that the term should not be avoided but instead carefully taught through context and explanation. While the writer's suggestions for alternative translations do provide a way to avoid potential misunderstandings, they do not necessarily dismiss the idea of carefully teaching the original meaning.\n\nThe comment I would include is: \"This response effectively addresses the concern about avoidance leading to theological gaps and misunderstandings, but could be improved by explicitly considering and responding to the opposing view that careful explanation can also be an effective way to convey the meaning of the term.\""
