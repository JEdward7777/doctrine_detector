  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides thoughtful consideration of the cultural context and potential misunderstandings surrounding the translation of the term \"Son of God.\" The suggested alternatives are respectful and attempt to maintain the original meaning while being culturally sensitive. However, the response falls short of directly addressing the specified concern that avoidance of the term can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. While the proposed alternatives aim to bridge cultural differences, they do not directly address the concern raised in the answer provided. A stronger connection between the proposed alternatives and the concern would strengthen the response."
