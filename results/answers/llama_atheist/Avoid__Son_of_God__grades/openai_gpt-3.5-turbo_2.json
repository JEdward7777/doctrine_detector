The alternative translations suggested show a thoughtful approach to preserving the original meaning while being culturally sensitive. However, the response does not directly address the specified concern that avoidance of the term could lead to theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. While the proposed alternatives are well thought out, they do not fully align with the original answer of not avoiding the term but rather teaching its meaning through context and explanation. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the complexities involved in translating sacred texts but could benefit from directly addressing the concern raised."
