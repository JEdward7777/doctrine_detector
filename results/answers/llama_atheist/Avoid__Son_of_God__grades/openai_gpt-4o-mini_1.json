  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful consideration of the potential challenges in translating the term \"Son of God\" into cultures with polytheistic backgrounds. The suggested alternative translations show a good attempt at finding culturally sensitive ways to convey Jesus' divine nature. However, the answer does not directly address the given answer that avoidance should be avoided, and the emphasis on providing context and explanation could potentially leave room for misinterpretation. While the response offers valuable insights, a stronger alignment with the Christian worldview's emphasis on teaching and explaining the true meaning of Jesus' identity would have improved the grade."
