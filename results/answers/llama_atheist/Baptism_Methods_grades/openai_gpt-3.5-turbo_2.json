The writer effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the interpretations within different Christian traditions. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the absence of discussing the theological significance and importance of baptism as a sacrament for believers could be improved upon. Additionally, the perspective of an atheist on understanding baptism lacks the recognition of its spiritual significance in Christian faith, which is a key aspect when discussing baptism within a Christian context."
