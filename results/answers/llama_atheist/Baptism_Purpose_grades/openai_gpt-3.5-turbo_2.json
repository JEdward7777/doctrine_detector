The explanation of baptism as a symbol of cleansing from sin and unity with Christ aligns well with Christian beliefs. However, the adherence to a neutral and atheistic perspective may lead to a lack of acknowledgment of the spiritual depth and transformational nature that Christians attribute to baptism. It would have been more insightful if the response had included a reflection on the spiritual impact of baptism for believers within a Christian worldview."
