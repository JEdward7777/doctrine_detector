  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-reasoned analysis from a neutral perspective, which is commendable. However, from a Christian worldview, the concern specifically highlights that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism, which the student did not directly address or affirm. While the student presented various perspectives on the relationship between repentance and baptism, they did not clearly acknowledge the Christian doctrine emphasizing repentance as a necessary step before baptism. Therefore, the grade is lower due to the lack of alignment with the Christian-specific concern provided."
