  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-written and informative response on the term \"gracious\" from a secular perspective, their answer did not align with the Christian obligation to be forgiving and kind as outlined in the given concern. The Christian worldview emphasizes extending grace, kindness, and forgiveness to others, especially in challenging situations or when wronged. Therefore, the student's response, although insightful, did not address the specific Christian principles related to being gracious."
