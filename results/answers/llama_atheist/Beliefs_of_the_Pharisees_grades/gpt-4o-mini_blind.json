However, as a Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of understanding and presenting beliefs accurately, a more objective stance on the Pharisees' beliefs from a Christian perspective would have been beneficial. Additionally, the reference to the writer being an atheist and the focus on scholarly views instead of exploring the beliefs from a Christian worldview may not align closely with a doctrinally focused analysis."
