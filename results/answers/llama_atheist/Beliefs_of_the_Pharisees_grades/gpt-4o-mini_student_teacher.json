  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed and well-researched overview of the beliefs of the Pharisees regarding life after death and spiritual beings. They accurately reference scholarly sources and present a nuanced understanding of the Pharisaic traditions. However, the student's personal beliefs as an atheist are irrelevant to the question and the Christian-specific worldview in this context. Additionally, while the answer delves into the complexities of Pharisaic beliefs, it could have been more concise and focused specifically on the beliefs of the Pharisees without unnecessary details."
