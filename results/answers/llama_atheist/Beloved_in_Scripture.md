## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating question!

In the New Testament letters, particularly those written by Paul and John, the term "beloved" (Greek: ἀγαπητός, agapētos) is used to convey a sense of endearment, affection, and even intimacy. When describing someone as "beloved," these authors are highlighting their special connection with God or other believers.

In 2 Corinthians 7:3-4, for instance, Paul addresses the Corinthian church as his "beloved" when encouraging them to cleanse themselves from any impurities. This phrase conveys a sense of affection and concern, emphasizing Paul's close relationship with these believers.

Similarly, in John's letters (1 John 2:7; 3:21; 4:7), the term "beloved" is often used to describe Christians who are in a special status before God. This language creates a sense of intimacy and closeness between the author and his audience, underscoring their shared experience as children of God.

In both cases, using "beloved" emphasizes the tender and affectionate nature of God's relationship with His people. It highlights the importance of personal connection, love, and unity within Christian communities.

So, while some might be tempted to view these references as mere sentimental expressions, I believe they offer a powerful representation of God's character – one characterized by unconditional love, acceptance, and care for humanity.
