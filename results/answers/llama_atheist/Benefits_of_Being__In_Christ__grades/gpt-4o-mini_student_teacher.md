As an atheist, I must clarify that I don't believe in the concept of a deity or supernatural entities, nor do I subscribe to religious dogma. However, I can attempt to provide a cultural and historical analysis of the notion of "sharing in Christ" within the context of Christianity.

From a sociological perspective, sharing in Christ can be seen as a means of fostering community and social cohesion among believers. The idea that individuals are united through their faith in Jesus Christ can serve as a powerful bonding agent, promoting empathy, cooperation, and collective action.

In terms of psychological benefits, sharing in Christ can provide a sense of belonging, purpose, and meaning for many people. For some, it may offer a coping mechanism for dealing with life's challenges, providing solace, comfort, and hope. The idea that one is part of a larger community that shares a common goal or purpose can also boost self-esteem, confidence, and overall well-being.

From an anthropological standpoint, sharing in Christ can be viewed as a cultural practice that shapes individuals' values, beliefs, and behaviors. Within Christian communities, this concept often involves moral guidelines, social norms, and rituals that serve to promote social harmony and stability.

It's essential to note that these benefits are not unique to Christianity or any religious tradition; similar phenomena can be observed in other cultures and societies where shared beliefs and values play a significant role in shaping individual and collective behaviors.

Ultimately, the benefits of sharing "in Christ" are deeply rooted in the cultural and historical context of Christianity. While I may not personally subscribe to these beliefs, it's crucial for me as an atheist scholar to acknowledge the significance of this concept within its own cultural framework and provide a nuanced understanding of its implications.

I would grade this student's answer a 20. 

While the student provides a well-structured analysis of the concept of "sharing in Christ" from sociological, psychological, and anthropological perspectives, the answer misses the crucial Christian-specific understanding of the benefits tied to relationship with Christ. The response primarily focuses on the concept as a cultural and social construct rather than delving into the spiritual significance and transformation that comes from being in Christ. As a Christian worldview places central importance on the personal relationship with Jesus Christ and the salvation He offers, the lack of acknowledgment of this core belief significantly impacts the relevance of the student's analysis to the given question.
