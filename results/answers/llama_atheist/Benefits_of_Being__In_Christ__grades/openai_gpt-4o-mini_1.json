The focus should have been on how knowing Christ, trusting Him as Savior, and experiencing the transformative power of His sacrifice can practically impact an individual's life, which was not clearly addressed in the response. More emphasis on the direct impact of a relationship with Christ would have been beneficial from the specified concern."
