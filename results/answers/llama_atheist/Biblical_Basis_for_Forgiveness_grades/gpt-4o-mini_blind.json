  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant Bible verses that emphasize the importance of forgiveness among individuals. However, the interpretation and explanation of these verses lack doctrinal correctness. The student's perspective of not subscribing to the religious views presented in the verses is noted, but the response lacks depth in understanding the theological implications and significance of forgiveness within a Christian worldview. It would be beneficial for the student to engage more deeply with the biblical context and implications of forgiveness in Christian theology."
