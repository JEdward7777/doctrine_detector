  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively identifies key Bible verses that support the practice of forgiveness among believers, showcasing an understanding of the importance of forgiveness within Christian teachings. However, the response could have been strengthened by further elaboration on each verse's significance and application in fostering forgiveness in relationships. Additionally, while the candidate acknowledges the cultural significance and moral insights of these verses, a greater exploration of how forgiveness reflects the nature of God and impacts human relationships from a Christian worldview would have enhanced the response."
