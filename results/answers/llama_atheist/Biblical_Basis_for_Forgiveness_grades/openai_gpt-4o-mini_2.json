  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response effectively identifies key Bible verses that support the practice of forgiveness among believers, which aligns with the concern provided. However, the response also includes additional verses that do not directly relate to forgiveness among believers, thus slightly diluting the focus of the answer. Further clarification and explanation on how each verse specifically emphasizes the necessity of forgiveness among believers could have strengthened the response."
