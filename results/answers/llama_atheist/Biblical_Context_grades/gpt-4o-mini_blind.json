  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the responsibilities of deacons as presented in the New Testament, with a focus on key passages such as 1 Timothy 3:8-13 and Acts 6:1-6. The explanation of the role of deacons in serving others, managing resources, providing spiritual support, and offering practical help is well articulated. The integration of biblical scholarship and critical analysis enhances the understanding of the topic. However, the response could have included more explicit references to the biblical text and the theological significance of deacons within the context of the early church."
