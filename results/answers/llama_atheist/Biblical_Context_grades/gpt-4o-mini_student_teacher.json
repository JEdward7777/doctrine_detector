  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer at 80. The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the responsibilities of deacons as outlined in the New Testament, drawing from relevant passages and discussing key aspects of their role such as service, administration, and practical help. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of servant-leadership and serving the needs of others within the church community. However, the student could have directly addressed the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, as mentioned in the reference answer, to receive a higher grade."
