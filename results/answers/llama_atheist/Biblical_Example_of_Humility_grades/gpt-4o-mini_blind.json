  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of humility as exemplified by Moses in the biblical narrative. However, the response falls short in acknowledging the supernatural and divine context of Moses' humility as portrayed in the Bible. The student's personal beliefs should not be used to undermine the foundational truths of the biblical account. Encouragement to consider and engage with the biblical text in its entirety would be beneficial to deepen their analysis and interpretation."
