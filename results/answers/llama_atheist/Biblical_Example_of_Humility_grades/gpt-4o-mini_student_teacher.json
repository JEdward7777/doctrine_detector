  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 50. While the student does a good job of finding a biblical example of humility in Moses and provides specific instances from the text to support their analysis, they fall short of truly engaging with a Christian worldview due to their personal beliefs. The student's approach lacks a recognition of the importance of humility as taught in the Christian faith and fails to connect humility to God's will and the idea of trusting and obeying God, which is fundamental in a Christian perspective on humility. Additionally, their emphasis on the cultural relevance of humility, while valid to a degree, detracts from a more in-depth exploration of the biblical understanding of humility."
