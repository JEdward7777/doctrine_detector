  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of Moses' character, highlighting his humility as he responds to God's call to lead the Israelites out of slavery. The student effectively breaks down Moses' actions into four key areas where he displays humility, and compares him to other biblical figures who may have displayed more self-confidence. The response also acknowledges that humility can be understood and applied in various cultural contexts.\n\nHowever, while the response meets the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures, it does not directly address the original answer about David being an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God. Instead, it focuses on Moses as a distinct example of humility. To receive a higher grade, the student could have more explicitly connected their analysis of Moses' character to the concept of humility in the scriptures and its relevance to David's story."
