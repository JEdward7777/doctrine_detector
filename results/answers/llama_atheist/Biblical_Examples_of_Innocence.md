## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I can provide you with some examples from Scripture that relate to the concept of innocence, specifically regarding Jesus and his accusers.

One notable example is John 18:23, where Pontius Pilate asks Jesus, "Don't you have a reply to make?" Jesus' response was, "You are the one who said I am a king. You are correct in saying it that I am a king. As for this, my kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36).

Here, Jesus emphasizes his innocence by highlighting Pilate's own words and actions. By using Pilate's phrase "You are the one who said I am a king," Jesus cleverly turns the tables on his accuser, pointing out that Pilate himself had acknowledged Jesus' kingdom as separate from this world.

Another example can be found in John 7:46-52, where some people were confused about Jesus' teachings and asked if He was really the Messiah. Jesus replied, "Now is the judge of this world; I know Him, for I came through His own" (John 7:53).

In this passage, Jesus indirectly emphasizes his innocence by highlighting God's role as the ultimate judge. By saying that He knew God and had come from Him, Jesus implied that he was innocent because he was fulfilling God's plan.

These examples illustrate how Jesus, despite being accused of wrongdoing, demonstrated his innocence through clever wordplay and references to divine authority. His words emphasized his connection to God, which ultimately justified his actions and vindicated him in the eyes of those who knew Him.

What do you think about these passages? Do you see any parallels between Jesus' defense strategies and our own experiences with accusations or misunderstandings?
