The references to Luke 23:47 and the acknowledgment of Jesus' innocence by the other criminal on the cross further reinforce the point regarding Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. The response effectively engages with the concern raised and offers a thoughtful analysis within a Christian worldview."
