  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides detailed explanations of several biblical examples illustrating mercy and effectively identifies key aspects of mercy, such as forgiveness, compassion, second chances, and unconditional love, their response lacks incorporation of the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student focuses solely on biblical examples but does not address the real-life applications of mercy as requested. Additionally, they chose not to examine theological or metaphysical implications, which are important for a Christian worldview analysis. The student's analysis is insightful, but there is room for improvement in aligning the content with the specific concern provided."
