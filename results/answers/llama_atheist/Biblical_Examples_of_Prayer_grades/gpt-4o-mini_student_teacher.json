  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided well-analyzed biblical examples illustrating the power and importance of prayer from an anthropological and literary perspective. However, the student could have incorporated more direct examples focused on the power of prayer itself, aligning more closely with the specific concern of fostering a stronger prayer life from biblical stories. The examples provided are insightful, but the teacher's reference answer offers more direct and pertinent examples to the concern at hand."
