Their interpretation lacks a Christian worldview perspective and dismisses the significance of divine intervention and moral accountability in the act of repentance. Additionally, the focus on secular interpretations and human psychology detracts from the biblical context of repentance as a spiritual and transformative process guided by God's grace and forgiveness."
