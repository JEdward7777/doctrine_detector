  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 75/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of repentance within a Christian worldview. They provide relevant examples from the Bible and articulate the importance of personal reflection and growth. However, the response lacks a direct engagement with the concern about learning from biblical examples to apply repentance in contemporary life. Including a brief discussion of the relevance of these examples to believers today would strengthen the overall response."
