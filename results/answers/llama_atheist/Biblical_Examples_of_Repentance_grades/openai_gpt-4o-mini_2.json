The connection to the practical application of repentance in believers' lives is effectively made through the discussion of these biblical examples. The response could have further emphasized the significance of repentance in the Christian worldview as a necessary step towards reconciliation with God and others, highlighting the transformative power of admitting wrongdoing and seeking forgiveness."
