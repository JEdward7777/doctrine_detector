  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Biblical references that illustrate the concept of transgression, but their approach lacks a crucial aspect of learning from Biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life. Instead, the student maintained a purely historical and cultural perspective without acknowledging the importance of applying moral lessons from these texts to personal conduct. A deeper engagement with the ethical implications of transgression in the student's analysis would have enhanced their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
