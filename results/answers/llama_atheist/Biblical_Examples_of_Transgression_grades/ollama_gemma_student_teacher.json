  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of transgression in both the Hebrew and New Testaments. They provide detailed examples from scripture to illustrate the idea of transgression as sin and disobedience. Additionally, the student acknowledges the cultural and historical context of these passages, demonstrating a secular perspective. However, the response could benefit from including more direct connections to the specified concern of learning from biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life."
