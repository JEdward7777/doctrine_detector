However, it falls short of addressing the concern regarding the implications of actions and God's forgiveness, as it lacks discussion on mercy and grace as illustrated in 1 Samuel 25:28 and Romans 5:20-21. From a Christian worldview, understanding the concept of trespassing must also include the role of God's forgiveness and the grace that overcomes sin."
