## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I don't believe in a supernatural deity, but I can still analyze the biblical text to understand its cultural significance and historical context.

One notable example of worship being negatively contrasted with idol worship can be found in Deuteronomy 4:15-20. Here, Moses warns the Israelites not to make any graven images or likenesses of God, as they did at Sinai (Exodus 32:1-6). He cautions them that such idolatry will lead to their destruction and separation from God.

The text states:

"Be careful therefore to follow the commands, decrees, and regulations that I am giving you today. Take heed to yourself so that you do not forget how the Lord your God led you all along these great and terrible ways—and that he appeared to you at Horeb, at the mountain from which you got the firestone and said to me, 'Gather the people before Me and say to them: Listen carefully, O Israel! You saw no form of any kind when the Lord spoke to you out of the fire on Mount Sinai. There was only the sound; never a shape or form—and that's why I told you, "Be careful what you do, so that you don't forget how the Lord your God appeared to you here at Horeb."'" (Deuteronomy 4:5-9)

In this passage, Moses presents God as a transcendent being who cannot be captured or represented by any physical form. He emphasizes that Israel's worship should focus on the invisible, unknowable God rather than creating idols to represent Him.

This text can be seen as a negative contrast between worship (focusing on the true, invisible God) and idol worship (creating graven images). The passage highlights the importance of faith in an unseen deity, warning against the temptation to create or worship physical representations of God.

Please note that this analysis is from a historical-cultural perspective, not from a religious one. As an atheist, I do not accept the supernatural claims made by the biblical text but rather examine its cultural and social significance within the ancient Near Eastern context.
