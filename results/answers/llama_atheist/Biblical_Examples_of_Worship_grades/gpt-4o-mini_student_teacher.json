  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as a 60.\n\nWhile the student effectively identified a passage from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship (Deuteronomy 4:15-20), they missed the direct mention of the contrast in Exodus 20:3 provided in the reference answer. The student's analysis from a historical-cultural perspective is insightful and well-written, showcasing a deep understanding of the biblical text and its context. However, the concern specifically emphasizes the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship, which the student did not directly address in their response. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrated strong analytical skills and knowledge of the biblical text, but they could improve by directly addressing the concern provided in the question and incorporating the reference answer's example to strengthen their response."
