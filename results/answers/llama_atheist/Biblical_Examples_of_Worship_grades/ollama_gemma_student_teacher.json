  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical text and the contrast between worship and idol worship. They provide a detailed analysis of Deuteronomy 4:15-20 and effectively highlight the importance of focusing on the invisible God rather than creating physical representations. \n\nThe student's acknowledgment of the historical and cultural context of the biblical text is also commendable. While they do not accept the supernatural claims of the Bible, their analysis remains relevant to the Christian concern about avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical text and the nature of worship."
