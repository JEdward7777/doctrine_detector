## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must clarify that my response will focus on the historical and cultural context of the New Testament, rather than any supernatural or divine implications.

According to the Gospel of Matthew (28:18-20), Jesus gave a directive to his apostles before his ascension, instructing them to:

"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

This passage, known as the Great Commission, highlights Jesus' emphasis on spreading his teachings and message to all people, regardless of their cultural or geographical background. It's a call to action for his followers to share the "good news" (or gospel) with others, which would become a central aspect of early Christian missionary work.

It's worth noting that this directive is often seen as a turning point in Jesus' ministry, marking the transition from his earthly ministry to the apostles' post-ascension mission. The Great Commission has since been interpreted and applied by various Christian traditions, shaping their approaches to evangelism, outreach, and community-building.
