The response focused on the historical and cultural context of the New Testament without delving into supernatural or divine aspects, in line with the atheist perspective stated at the beginning. However, from a Christian worldview, the explanation would be incomplete without acknowledging the divine significance of Jesus' words and the supernatural power behind the spread of the gospel. Additionally, the response could have included a mention of the importance of faith and repentance in responding to the good news."
