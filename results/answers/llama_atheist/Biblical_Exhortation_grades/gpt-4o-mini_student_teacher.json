  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate response regarding Jesus' directive to his apostles in the Great Commission from a historical and cultural perspective. However, the response did not acknowledge the supernatural or divine nature of Jesus' instructions, which are foundational beliefs for Christians. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to recognize that evangelism is not just about spreading teachings but sharing the life-changing message of salvation through Jesus Christ. The response lacked this key theological aspect, hence the lower grade."
