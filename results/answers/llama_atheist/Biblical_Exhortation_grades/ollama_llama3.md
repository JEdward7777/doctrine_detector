## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must clarify that my response will focus on the historical and cultural context of the New Testament, rather than any supernatural or divine implications.

According to the Gospel of Matthew (28:18-20), Jesus gave a directive to his apostles before his ascension, instructing them to:

"Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

This passage, known as the Great Commission, highlights Jesus' emphasis on spreading his teachings and message to all people, regardless of their cultural or geographical background. It's a call to action for his followers to share the "good news" (or gospel) with others, which would become a central aspect of early Christian missionary work.

It's worth noting that this directive is often seen as a turning point in Jesus' ministry, marking the transition from his earthly ministry to the apostles' post-ascension mission. The Great Commission has since been interpreted and applied by various Christian traditions, shaping their approaches to evangelism, outreach, and community-building.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a clear and concise summary of Jesus' directive to his apostles in the Great Commission, highlighting its significance as a call to action for spreading the gospel to all people. It also acknowledges the passage's impact on Christian traditions and practices.

However, the response does not explicitly address the concern of recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith, which is stated in the given answer. While the response mentions Jesus' emphasis on sharing his teachings and message, it does not directly emphasize the significance or necessity of evangelism as a vital aspect of the Christian faith.

The comment I would provide is: "This response provides a good summary of the Great Commission, but could benefit from more explicit connection to the concern about recognizing the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith. With further development and emphasis on this point, the response could be even stronger."
