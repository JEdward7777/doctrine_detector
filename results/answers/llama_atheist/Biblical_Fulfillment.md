## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating question! As an atheist, I must approach this inquiry without apologetic or dogmatic undertones. Instead, I'll examine the historical and literary context of the reference to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the Bible, with a focus on its possible connections to Old Testament prophecies.

The phrase "King of the Jews" appears prominently in John 19:14-15, where Pontius Pilate asks Jesus if he is the "King of the Jews" during his trial. This reference has been interpreted by many Christian scholars as an allusion to the Old Testament prophecy found in Psalm 2:6-12 and Zechariah 9:9-10.

In these prophecies, we find descriptions of a future king or messianic figure who will reign over Israel and bring about a new era. Psalm 2:6-7 speaks of God's anointed one ( Messiah) who will rule with an iron scepter and smite the nations that refuse to obey him.

Zechariah 9:9-10, on the other hand, predicts the coming of a peaceful king who will ride into Jerusalem on a donkey, bringing salvation and peace to Israel. This image is often seen as an allusion to Jesus' humble entry into Jerusalem on a donkey (Matthew 21:1-11), which further solidifies his claim to be the long-awaited Messiah.

The reference to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in John 19:14-15 can thus be seen as a fulfillment of these Old Testament prophecies. Pilate's question may have been intended to mock Jesus' messianic claims, but for Christians, it represents a moment when the prophetic expectations of Israel were being fulfilled.

However, it is essential to recognize that this connection between Jesus and the Old Testament prophecies is not universally accepted by scholars. Some have argued that these references might be later interpolations or Christian reinterpretations of Jewish texts. Therefore, while I can provide an overview of the possible connections between Jesus and Old Testament prophecies, it is crucial for readers to approach this topic with a critical eye.

What do you think? Do you see any other potential connections between Jesus' claim to kingship and Old Testament prophecies?
