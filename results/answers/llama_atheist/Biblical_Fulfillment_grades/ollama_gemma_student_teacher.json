  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student provides a well-researched and thoughtful analysis of the references to Jesus as \"King of the Jews\" in the Bible and their possible connection to Old Testament prophecies. They demonstrate a clear understanding of the relevant prophecies and their significance in Christian theology. The student's ability to critically assess the scholarly debate surrounding the interpretation of these texts is commendable. However, a more explicit statement regarding the fulfillment of these prophecies by Jesus would have elevated the grade."
