  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response lacks the doctrinal correctness required in discussing Bible verses that illustrate God's majesty from a Christian worldview. The student's perspective as an atheist results in a flawed understanding of the concept being discussed and dismisses the foundational belief in the existence of a divine being. While the literary and cultural significance of the verses is acknowledged, the spiritual significance and true nature of God's majesty are missing from the analysis."
