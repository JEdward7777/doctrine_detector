  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful analysis of the cultural significance of the biblical passages related to God's majesty. \n\nThe student correctly points out that the verses convey a sense of awe and reverence for the divine, highlighting God's power, sovereignty, and creativity. \n\nThe student's secular perspective provides a unique approach to understanding the passages, focusing on their literary and cultural context rather than supernatural or religious interpretations. \n\nHowever, the student could strengthen their response by directly connecting the biblical verses with the understanding of God's majestic nature from a Christian worldview. This would provide a more comprehensive analysis of the topic."
