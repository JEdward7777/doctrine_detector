However, as an atheist, the respondent's perspective lacks the acknowledgment of the divine nature of God as presented in the provided Bible references. From a Christian worldview, it is important to recognize and acknowledge God's divine attributes, not just His cultural significance. The response could have benefited from addressing the concept of God's majesty from a Christian perspective, rather than solely focusing on the literary and cultural aspects."
