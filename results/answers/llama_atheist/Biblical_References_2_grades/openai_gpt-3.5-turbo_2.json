  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of various Bible verses that convey a sense of God's majesty from a literary and cultural perspective. The student effectively engages with the concern by discussing the significance of these verses in highlighting God's greatness and power. However, the response falls short of connecting the specific verses mentioned in the provided answer (2 Peter 1:16-18, Daniel 4:36, Isaiah 2:10, Jude 1:25, and Micah 5:4) with the overall concept of God's majestic nature, which would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
