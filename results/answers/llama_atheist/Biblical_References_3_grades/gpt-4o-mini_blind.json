As a Christian, it's important to approach this topic from a doctrinal standpoint, emphasizing the Messianic significance of these Old Testament references. The answer also falls short in connecting these references directly to the prophesied Messiah in the Christian faith, relying more on Jewish interpretations. An integration of theological insights would greatly enhance the response."
