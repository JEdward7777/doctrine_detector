  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed analysis of Old Testament references related to the \"Son of Man\" concept; however, the response lacked a thorough examination from a Christian worldview. The answer focused more on historical and cultural analysis rather than theological perspectives, which are essential for understanding the Messianic role of Jesus as the \"Son of Man\" in the New Testament. The student should have delved deeper into the specific Messianic implications of the identified Old Testament passages and their significance in shaping Jewish expectations of the coming Messiah."
