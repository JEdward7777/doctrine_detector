  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe student provides a thorough analysis of various Old Testament passages that contain the term \"Son of Man,\" including Ezekiel, Daniel, and Psalm 8. They demonstrate an understanding of the historical and cultural context in which these passages were written and how they may have influenced Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern of exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\" The student's focus is more on the historical and cultural analysis of the Old Testament passages themselves rather than their relevance to the New Testament concept of Jesus as the Son of Man.\n\nThe student does mention that these references may have contributed to the cultural landscape that would later influence Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah, but this is not explored further in relation to the New Testament. To earn a higher grade, the student could have provided more explicit connections between the Old Testament passages and the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Son of Man.\n\nComment: While this response provides a solid analysis of the Old Testament passages that contain the term \"Son of Man,\" it falls short in directly addressing the concern about how these passages inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role. To strengthen the response, the student could have provided more explicit connections between the Old Testament and the New Testament, highlighting how the Old Testament passages laid the groundwork for the New Testament's understanding of Jesus as the Son of Man."
