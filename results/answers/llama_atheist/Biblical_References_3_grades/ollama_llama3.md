## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must emphasize that my responses will be grounded in historical and cultural analysis rather than theological or religious perspectives.

In the Old Testament, the term "Son of Man" (Hebrew: בן אדם, ben adam) appears 14 times in Ezekiel 2:1-3:15. In this context, it refers to a divine figure who is prophesied to appear as a human-like being, often symbolizing God's presence or judgment.

One key reference that contributes to the understanding of the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah is Daniel 7:13-14, which speaks of a divine figure who is given dominion over all nations and peoples. This passage may have influenced Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah, who would be a human-like figure with divine authority.

Another important reference is Psalm 8:4-6, which describes a mortal man being exalted to the level of God's angels. Some interpreters suggest that this psalm may have been seen as a prototype for the concept of the "Son of Man" – a human-like figure who would be elevated to divine status.

Additionally, in Daniel 7:22-28, a divine figure is described who is given authority over all nations and peoples. This passage may have also influenced Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah, who would be a human-like figure with divine authority.

It's essential to note that these references were not necessarily interpreted as referring to a future Messiah in the classical sense during the Old Testament period. Instead, they likely represented various prophetic or apocalyptic themes related to God's presence, judgment, or salvation.

In summary, while the term "Son of Man" is most prominent in Ezekiel, other Old Testament references like Daniel 7 and Psalm 8 may have contributed to the cultural landscape that would later influence Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The student provides a thorough analysis of various Old Testament passages that contain the term "Son of Man," including Ezekiel, Daniel, and Psalm 8. They demonstrate an understanding of the historical and cultural context in which these passages were written and how they may have influenced Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah.

However, the response does not directly address the concern of exploring how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man." The student's focus is more on the historical and cultural analysis of the Old Testament passages themselves rather than their relevance to the New Testament concept of Jesus as the Son of Man.

The student does mention that these references may have contributed to the cultural landscape that would later influence Jewish apocalyptic expectations about the coming Messiah, but this is not explored further in relation to the New Testament. To earn a higher grade, the student could have provided more explicit connections between the Old Testament passages and the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Son of Man.

Comment: While this response provides a solid analysis of the Old Testament passages that contain the term "Son of Man," it falls short in directly addressing the concern about how these passages inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role. To strengthen the response, the student could have provided more explicit connections between the Old Testament and the New Testament, highlighting how the Old Testament passages laid the groundwork for the New Testament's understanding of Jesus as the Son of Man.
