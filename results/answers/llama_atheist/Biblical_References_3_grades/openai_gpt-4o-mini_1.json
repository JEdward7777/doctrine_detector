  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed analysis of the term \"Son of Man\" in the Old Testament, referencing key passages like Daniel 7 and Psalms 8 that contribute to understanding the concept of the Messiah. The student appropriately explores the historical and cultural context without delving into theological perspectives. The only area for improvement would be to directly connect these Old Testament references to the New Testament understanding of Jesus\u2019 messianic role as the 'Son of Man' more explicitly. Overall, a strong and well-researched response."
