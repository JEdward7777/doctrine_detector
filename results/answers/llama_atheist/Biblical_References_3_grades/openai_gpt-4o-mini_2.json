  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of the Old Testament references to the term \"Son of Man\" and how they may have influenced Jewish expectations of the Messiah. The candidate effectively integrates the specified answer into their discussion and highlights relevant passages. However, the response falls short of explicitly connecting how these Old Testament themes inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the 'Son of Man,' which is the primary concern outlined. More emphasis on linking these Old Testament concepts to Jesus' messianic identity in the New Testament would have strengthened the response."
