## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I can certainly provide information on biblical passages that demonstrate the use of "Lord" in reference to God without endorsing or promoting religious beliefs.

In the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), the term "Lord" is often translated from the Hebrew word "Yahweh" (יְהוָה). For example:

* In Psalm 23:1, David writes, "The Lord is my shepherd." Here, the Lord refers to God as a guiding figure in one's life.
* In Isaiah 40:29, it says, "He gives power to the faint; and to those without might he increases strength. Even youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall stumble and fall; but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength." In this passage, waiting for the Lord implies trusting in God's guidance.

In the New Testament, the term "Lord" is often used to translate the Greek word "Kurios" (Κύριος), which means master or lord. Examples include:

* In Matthew 7:21-23, Jesus says, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do what my Father in heaven wants them to." Here, calling someone "Lord" implies submission and obedience.
* In Acts 11:17, Peter refers to Jesus as "the Lord," emphasizing his authority over believers.

These passages illustrate how the term "Lord" is used to describe God or Jesus Christ's relationship with humanity.
