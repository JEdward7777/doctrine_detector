  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student effectively provided examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in reference to God, both from the Old and New Testaments. However, the response lacked a clear focus on acknowledging God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord, as outlined in the specified concern. Additionally, the student's atheistic viewpoint may have hindered a more comprehensive exploration of the concept of God as Lord from a Christian worldview."
