  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 65. \n\nWhile the student accurately identifies and explains biblical passages that demonstrate the use of \"Lord\" in reference to God with reference to both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, they do not address the concern provided fully. The concern emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's authority and acknowledging Him as Lord, however, the response does not directly address this significance in relation to the biblical references provided. The response should make a more direct connection between the use of \"Lord\" and the concept of recognizing God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord to fully address the concern from a Christian worldview perspective."
