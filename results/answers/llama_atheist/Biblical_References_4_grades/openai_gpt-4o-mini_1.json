  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of biblical passages using the term \"Lord\" to refer to God's authority and divinity. It demonstrates an understanding of how these references reinforce the importance of acknowledging God as Lord. However, the response does not explicitly emphasize the significance of recognizing and submitting to God's authority in the context of human relationship with Him, which is a key element from the specified concern. Integrating this aspect more explicitly would have further strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
