The student provides a clear and concise explanation of the symbolism of unleavened bread in 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, drawing a parallel between the removal of leaven and the need for spiritual purification. The student also thoughtfully discusses the early Christian church's adoption of Jewish customs and symbolism while reinterpreting them within a new theological framework."
