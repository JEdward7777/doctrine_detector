## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that requires a nuanced and contextualized response!

The connection between unleavened bread and Christian teachings can be found in 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, where the apostle Paul writes:

"Clean out the old yeast so you may be a new batch without yeast - as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed."

Here, Paul is drawing an analogy between the Jewish practice of removing leaven (yeast) from their bread to prepare for Passover and the Christian concept of spiritual purification. In this passage, Paul likens Jesus Christ to a Passover lamb, referencing Exodus 12:1-28, where the Israelites are instructed to sacrifice a lamb during the first Passover.

In this context, the "leaven" represents sin and corruption, which must be removed for one to partake in the spiritual feast of communion with God. The "unleavened bread" thus symbolizes the purification and redemption that comes through faith in Jesus Christ, just as the Israelites were redeemed from slavery in Egypt.

This passage highlights the early Christian church's adoption of Jewish customs and symbolism while reinterpreting them within a new theological framework.
