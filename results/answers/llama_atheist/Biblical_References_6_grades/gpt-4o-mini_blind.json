  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65 \n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive list of Bible verses related to the concept of resurrection, touching on various passages from the Old and New Testaments. The analysis from a cultural and historical perspective is well-articulated, although the student's acknowledgment of their atheist worldview may limit their understanding of the theological and supernatural significance of these verses. It is important to recognize that Christian doctrine emphasizes the literal belief in resurrection as a core tenet of faith, based on the teachings of Jesus Christ and the promises of eternal life. The lack of theological insight and spiritual understanding in the response hinders its completeness, resulting in a lower grade."
