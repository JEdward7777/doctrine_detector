  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed analysis of various Bible verses related to the concept of resurrection and made a good effort to address the question. However, the student lacked the essential focus on scripture as the authoritative source for Christian beliefs. As a Christian, it is important to ground discussions on theological topics such as resurrection in the direct teachings of the Bible rather than personal interpretations or opinions. The focus on cultural and historical context, as indicated by the student's atheist perspective, does not align with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the divine inspiration and authority of scripture. The student's analysis could be improved by directly referencing and discussing the specific verses provided in the reference answer given by the teacher."
