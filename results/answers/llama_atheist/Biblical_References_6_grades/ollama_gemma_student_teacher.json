  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of resurrection within a Christian worldview. They effectively analyze the biblical texts, providing relevant passages and explaining their significance. However, the response would benefit from including more direct references to the specific verses suggested by the teacher as the basis for their insights. Additionally, the student's atheism does not seem to have influenced their ability to provide a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the biblical texts on resurrection."
