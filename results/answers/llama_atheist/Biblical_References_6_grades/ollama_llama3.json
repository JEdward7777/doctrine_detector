  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of focusing on scripture, as required by the concern. It provides numerous Bible verses that discuss resurrection and eternal life, including some that are specifically relevant to Jesus' teachings on the topic. The writer also demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural and historical context in which these passages were written.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement. While the response does cite some key passages related to Jesus' teachings on resurrection, it could have delved deeper into their meaning and significance. Additionally, the writer could have more explicitly connected the Old Testament passages they cited to Jesus' teachings on the topic. Despite these limitations, the response overall does a good job of grounding its discussion in authoritative Christian texts.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the importance of scripture in shaping Christian beliefs and teachings. However, it could benefit from further analysis and application of the Bible verses cited to Jesus' teachings on resurrection."
