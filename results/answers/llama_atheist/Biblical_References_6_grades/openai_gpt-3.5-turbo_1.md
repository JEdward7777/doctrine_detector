## [Answer](../Biblical_References_6.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of Christian theology! As an atheist, I must acknowledge that my understanding and analysis will be based on the cultural and historical context of the text, rather than any theological or supernatural significance.

That being said, if we're looking for insights into the concept of resurrection in the Bible, there are several verses that provide important clues. Here are a few key passages:

1. Job 14:14-15 - This passage speaks of the hope of a resurrected body, where God will "wake up" and "rouse" the deceased to new life.
2. Daniel 12:2-3 - In this apocalyptic vision, Daniel sees the dead rising from their graves to face judgment.
3. Psalm 16:10-11 - King David writes about his confidence in being reunited with God after death, suggesting a kind of resurrection or afterlife.
4. Isaiah 26:19 - This passage speaks of the dead being raised and returning to their cities, with no more fear of death or mourning.

In terms of Jesus' own teachings on resurrection, we see:

1. Matthew 22:31-32; Mark 12:18-27 - Jesus quotes from the Old Testament (Exodus 3:6) when asked about the nature of the afterlife, emphasizing the importance of honoring one's parents and the idea that God is the God of both the living and the dead.
2. John 5:25-29 - In this passage, Jesus claims to be the "resurrection and the life" who has power over death and can give eternal life.

Other key verses that touch on resurrection include:

1. Ezekiel 37:12-14 - This vision of a valley filled with dry bones is often seen as a metaphor for the resurrection of the dead.
2. Hosea 13:14 - This Old Testament passage speaks of God's judgment and the resurrection of the wicked, contrasting with the righteous who will be raised to eternal life.

Please note that these verses are not necessarily meant to provide a detailed account of what resurrection looks like or how it works; rather, they offer glimpses into ancient Jewish and Christian understandings of death, afterlife, and the hope of new life beyond this mortal coil.
