However, it lacks a deep analysis of the scriptural backing for the Sabbath observance in Christianity beyond mentioning some verses. A stronger integration of these scriptures to explain the relevance of Sabbath observance in Christian faith would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
