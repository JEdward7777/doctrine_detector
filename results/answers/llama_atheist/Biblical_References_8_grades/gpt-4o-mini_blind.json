As an atheist, the student is unable to provide a Christian-specific worldview which is essential in interpreting these verses correctly. The student accurately presented the verses, but the interpretation lacks the doctrinal depth and significance that a Christian worldview would provide. It is important to approach the topic of redemption from a Christian perspective to grasp the full theological implications and significance of the concept of ransom in the Bible."
