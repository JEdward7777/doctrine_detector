  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of Bible verses referencing the concept of ransom and how they contribute to the understanding of redemption. However, the student failed to engage with the specified concern of exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. Additionally, the student's analysis lacks a Christian worldview perspective, as they self-identify as an atheist and provide a neutral analysis. To improve the grade, the student should focus on integrating Christian theological perspectives and delve deeper into the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption."
