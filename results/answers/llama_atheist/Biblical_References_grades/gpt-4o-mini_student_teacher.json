  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of biblical passages related to covenant faithfulness, which is commendable. However, the answer lacks a Christian worldview perspective and does not connect the scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness as required by the concern. The focus on atheistic and culturally sensitive approach detracts from the Christian-specific perspective needed for this assignment. The inclusion of only one Bible reference provided by the teacher also highlights a lack of depth in engaging with the topic."
