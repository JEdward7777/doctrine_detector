  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a couple of biblical references related to covenant faithfulness as requested, but did not deeply explain how these passages specifically illustrate the idea of covenant faithfulness. Additionally, the response did not fully engage with the concern provided, as it offered more examples of biblical passages rather than delving into the understanding of covenant faithfulness itself. More in-depth analysis and connection between the examples given and the concept of covenant faithfulness would significantly enhance the response."
