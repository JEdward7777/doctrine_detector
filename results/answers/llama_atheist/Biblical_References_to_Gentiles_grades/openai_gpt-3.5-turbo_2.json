  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively analyzes the passages from Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 from a non-theistic perspective, highlighting the early Christian community's recognition of Gentile inclusion and the transformation of Paul's faith. The student provides insightful interpretations in line with the specified concern on exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of faith in Jesus over adherence to the law as a central theme in these passages, aligning more closely with the given answer."
