  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed analysis of the selected biblical passages from Acts and Galatians, considering the themes of Gentile inclusion and the shift towards faith in Jesus. However, the analysis lacks a direct connection to the central theme of grace as the basis for justification before God. While the response offers valuable insights from a non-theistic perspective, it does not fully address the concern of exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion within a Christian worldview."
