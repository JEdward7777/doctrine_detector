  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60. \n\nWhile the student did provide several relevant Bible verses and offered some analysis of their cultural and historical contexts, the response primarily focused on a scholarly approach grounded in empirical evidence rather than a Christian worldview perspective. The student could have delved deeper into the spiritual and theological implications of these verses and how they contribute to understanding God's kingdom and the realities associated with heaven. Additionally, the response could have incorporated more Scriptural references directly related to the concept of heaven as outlined in the concern. Strengthening the connection between the verses cited and the exploration of God's kingdom would have enhanced the overall response."
