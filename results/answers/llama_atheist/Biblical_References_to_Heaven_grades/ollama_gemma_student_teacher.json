They provide relevant examples of how these contexts shape the understanding of these verses. \n\nThe student's critical analysis and consideration of the broader social and intellectual influences on the biblical notions of heaven show a deep understanding of the subject. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from including more specific references to the key verses suggested by the teacher. This would strengthen the student's argument and provide additional evidence to support their claims."
