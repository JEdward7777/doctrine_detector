However, there is a lack of clear integration of the specified concern emphasizing God's kingdom and the physical and spiritual realities associated with heaven. The response could have been strengthened by directly addressing how the mentioned verses illustrate these aspects and deepen our understanding from a Christian worldview perspective."
