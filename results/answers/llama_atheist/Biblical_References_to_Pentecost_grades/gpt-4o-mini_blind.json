  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a decent overview of the Festival of Weeks and its references in the Bible, mentioning relevant passages from the Old Testament (Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers) and the New Testament (Acts). The student could improve the answer by emphasizing the theological and historical significance of Pentecost for Christians, linking it more explicitly to the Feast of Weeks in the Old Testament. Additionally, a stronger connection between the Old Testament references and the New Testament fulfillment at Pentecost would enhance the answer's coherence and depth. The student shows a good understanding but has room to deepen the theological implications further."
