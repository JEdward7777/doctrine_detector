  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 75.\n\nThe student correctly identified some key references to the Festival of Weeks in Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts, which aligns with the teacher's reference answer. However, the student did not mention 2 Chronicles, which was included in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the student's answer did not explicitly connect the significance of Pentecost to the festival's observance as the concern required. The student provided good information but could have enhanced their answer by tying the observance and significance of Pentecost more directly to the references provided."
