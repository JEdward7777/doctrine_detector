  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of references to the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) in ancient texts such as Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts. It correctly highlights the significance of this festival in Jewish tradition and its connections to the biblical narrative. The additional information on Acts 2:1-47 and the debate among scholars regarding the Festival of Weeks adds depth to the discussion. The only area for improvement would be to directly address the concern raised in the grading criteria and provide a clearer explanation of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost."
