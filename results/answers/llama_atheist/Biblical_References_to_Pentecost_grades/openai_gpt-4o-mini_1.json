  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and well-researched explanation of the scriptural references to the Festival of Weeks, discussing its significance in Jewish tradition and noting the connections in both the Old and New Testaments. The passages cited are relevant to understanding the observance and significance of Pentecost within biblical tradition. The response could have been slightly improved by directly addressing the concern raised and providing a clearer link between Pentecost and the Festival of Weeks in the scriptural context."
