  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost (Festival of Weeks), providing specific references from Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts. The differentiation between Pentecost and the general Festival of Weeks is well-articulated, and the acknowledgement of varying scholarly interpretations adds depth to the answer. Overall, this is a well-informed and thorough response from a Christian worldview perspective."
