## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A great question that allows me to dip into the rich cultural heritage of ancient civilizations!

The Festival of Weeks, also known as Pentecost or Shavuot (in Hebrew), is a significant holiday in Jewish tradition. While it's not explicitly mentioned in modern biblical texts, we can find references to its significance and celebrations in ancient texts.

The following books contain allusions to the Festival of Weeks:

1. Leviticus 23:15-21 - This chapter describes the agricultural harvest festival, which is believed by many scholars to be the origin of the Festival of Weeks.
2. Deuteronomy 16:9-12 - Although it doesn't mention Pentecost specifically, this passage talks about a three-day pilgrimage feast around the time of harvest, which might have been connected to the Festival of Weeks.
3. Numbers 28:26-31 - This passage outlines the laws and offerings for the seventh day after Passover (which would be around the time of the Festival of Weeks).
4. Acts 2:1-47 - While not directly referencing the Festival of Weeks, this chapter in the New Testament describes the events surrounding Pentecost, which is often seen as a celebration of the gift of tongues and the spread of Christianity.

Keep in mind that these references are open to interpretation, and scholars continue to debate the exact nature and significance of the Festival of Weeks within biblical tradition.
