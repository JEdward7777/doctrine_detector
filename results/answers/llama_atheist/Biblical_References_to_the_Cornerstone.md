A question that requires a nuanced answer!

While there isn't a specific verse that directly calls Jesus the "cornerstone," I can provide some context from Scripture to help clarify Jesus' role.

In Ephesians 2:20-22, Paul writes:

"Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone. In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord. And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God delights."

Here, Paul uses the metaphor of a building to illustrate the Church's foundation and structure. He highlights Jesus as the "cornerstone," emphasizing His central role in uniting the believers into a single entity.

In Matthew 21:42-44, Jesus Himself alludes to being the cornerstone:

"Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures: “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes”? The stone the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. And the one who falls on that rock will be broken to pieces, but the rock will crush them into powder.'"

Here, Jesus quotes Psalm 118:22-23, using the phrase "cornerstone" (or "head of the corner") to describe His role as the foundation stone upon which God's building is constructed. This passage emphasizes the idea that those who reject Jesus will be broken or crushed, while those who come to Him will find a solid foundation.

In 1 Peter 2:4-8, Peter writes:

"As you come to him, a living stone rejected by humans but chosen and precious in God’s sight— you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in Scripture: “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, elect, a cornerstone, chosen of God, and precious; And whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.”"

Here, Peter uses the metaphor of living stones to describe believers who are being built into a spiritual temple through their relationship with Jesus. The cornerstone is again emphasized as the foundation upon which this edifice is constructed.

In summary, while there isn't a single verse that explicitly calls Jesus the "cornerstone," these passages collectively convey His role as the central, unifying figure in God's plan for humanity.
