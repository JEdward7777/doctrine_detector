  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a thorough and nuanced answer to the question, providing biblical support for Jesus' role as the cornerstone from multiple passages (Ephesians 2:20-22, Matthew 21:42-44, and 1 Peter 2:4-8). The writer also acknowledges that there isn't a single verse that explicitly calls Jesus the \"cornerstone,\" which shows an understanding of the complexity of Scripture.\n\nThe response meets the concern by encouraging believers to explore Scripture in order to deepen their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith. The writer provides a clear and concise summary of the biblical passages, making it easy for readers to follow along and understand the importance of Jesus as the cornerstone.\n\nTo reach a higher grade, the response could have provided more explicit connections between Jesus' role as the cornerstone and its implications for believers' daily lives or spiritual growth. Additionally, the writer could have incorporated more personal anecdotes or examples to illustrate how exploring Scripture has deepened their own understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith."
