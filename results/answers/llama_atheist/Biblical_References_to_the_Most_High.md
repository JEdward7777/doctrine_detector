## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheistic scholar, I must clarify that my response will be based on a critical examination of the biblical text, without assuming any inherent divine authority or supernatural interpretations. Here are some key Bible verses that refer to God as the "Most High" (Latin: Summus) and what they might reveal about His character:

1. Psalm 47:2 - "The Most High has dominion over the kingdoms of men; He is highly exalted above all the nations."

This verse emphasizes God's sovereignty over human kingdoms, highlighting His authority and power.

2. Isaiah 14:13-15 - "You have said, 'I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God... But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.'"

In this passage, God is referred to as the Most High, emphasizing His exalted position. The verse also highlights God's justice and power in bringing down prideful individuals.

3. Psalm 91:1 - "Who dwells in the shelter of the Most High, who abides in the shadow of the Almighty."

This psalm describes those who seek refuge under God's protection as dwelling in the shelter of the Most High. This reveals God's character as a benevolent provider and protector.

4. Genesis 14:18-20 - "Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was priest of God Most High... He blessed Abram, saying, 'Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth...'"

This passage highlights God's role as the creator of all things, emphasizing His power and authority. Melchizedek's blessing of Abram also underscores God's benevolence.

5. 1 Chronicles 16:15-18 - "Then Hezekiah spoke to them according to the wisdom of his father David, and he said, 'You have brought them much shame; your hearts are so hardened that we can no longer consecrate you... So now give orders that a chest be issued in the name of the Lord God Most High.'"

In this passage, King Hezekiah references God as the Most High, emphasizing His divine authority. The verse also highlights God's concern for the spiritual well-being of His people.

These verses collectively portray God as:

1. Sovereign: Ruling over human kingdoms and having dominion over all nations.
2. Just: Bringing down prideful individuals and punishing evil.
3. Benevolent: Providing shelter, protection, and blessings to those who seek Him.
4. Creator: Having power and authority over the creation of heaven and earth.
5. Concerned: Interested in the spiritual well-being of His people.

In conclusion, these Bible verses reinforce the idea that God is often referred to as the "Most High," emphasizing His divine nature, sovereignty, justice, benevolence, creativity, and concern for humanity. As an atheistic scholar, I acknowledge the cultural significance and historical context of these passages, while also recognizing the challenges in reconciling their claims with our modern understanding of the universe.
