The inclusion of specific verses and their interpretations demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical text. The response effectively addresses the concern by exploring different facets of God's sovereignty portrayed in the Bible. While the perspective of an atheistic scholar is acknowledged, the focus on the biblical text and its implications aligns well with a Christian worldview."
