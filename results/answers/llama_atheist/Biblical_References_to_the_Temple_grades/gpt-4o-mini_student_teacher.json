  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and thorough response, identifying key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as the \"house of Yahweh\" within the Hebrew Bible. While the student included additional verses beyond what the reference answer provided, they effectively demonstrated an understanding of the topic and supported their points with relevant passages. Great job overall, but could have slightly focused more on the specific verses mentioned in the reference answer."
