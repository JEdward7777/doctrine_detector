## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that requires a thorough examination of ancient texts!

The concept of the "house of Yahweh" is indeed referenced in several scriptures within the Hebrew Bible (also known as the Old Testament). Here are some specific passages that mention the temple as the "house of Yahweh":

1. 2 Chronicles 7:1 - "When Solomon had finished praying, fire appeared from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices. When all the people saw this, they fell to the ground in worship." (Note: This passage explicitly calls the temple the "house of Yahweh" in verse 12.)
2. 1 Kings 8:27 - "But will God really dwell on earth? The heaven, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple that I have built!" (King Solomon's prayer to Yahweh)
3. Psalm 122:6-7 - "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May those who love her be secure. May there be peace within your walls and prosperity within your people." (This psalm is often interpreted as a reference to the temple, which was located in Jerusalem.)
4. Isaiah 56:1-2 - "Thus says Yahweh: 'Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is near to come. A book of remembrance was written before me by one who knows how to record it—of those who fear me and honor my name.'"
5. Jeremiah 7:10-11 - "'Stop at the entrance to the Rock; stop. Let the names of the righteous people you have chosen appear; let this city become a place where all your wisdom can be known—the one in which you live, by which we move and on which we dwell.'" (This passage is often seen as a critique of temple worship, but it still references the temple as the "house" or "place" of Yahweh.)

These scriptures demonstrate that the concept of the "house of Yahweh" was an important aspect of ancient Israelite faith, emphasizing the connection between the divine and human realms.
