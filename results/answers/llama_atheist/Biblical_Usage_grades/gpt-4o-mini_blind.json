However, their atheistic perspective leads them to downplay the theological and spiritual importance of this term in the Christian worldview. The response would benefit from a more robust exploration of the divine purpose and significance of lineage within the biblical narrative. Additionally, there is a need for greater emphasis on the doctrinal understanding of the term \"begat\" within Christian theology."
