  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The answer provides relevant examples of where the term \"woe\" is used in the Bible and mentions their connection to God's judgment. However, the analysis lacks theological depth and fails to acknowledge the Christian worldview regarding the authority of God and His ultimate judgment. Additionally, the student's disclaimer about being an atheist detracts from a more robust exploration of the biblical concept of \"woe\" in relation to God's righteous judgment. A stronger inclusion of scriptural interpretation from a Christian worldview would have enriched the response."
