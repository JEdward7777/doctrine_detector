  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: The student provided pertinent examples of the term \"woe\" in the Bible and touched on aspects of divine judgment. However, the response lacks depth in analyzing the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. The analysis primarily focuses on the surface meaning of the passages without delving into the implications for individuals or societies facing divine retribution. Additionally, the perspective offered is solely based on cultural and historical context without considering the spiritual implications of divine judgment from a Christian worldview."
