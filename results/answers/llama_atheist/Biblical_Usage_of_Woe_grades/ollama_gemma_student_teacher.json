  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides detailed examples from the Bible illustrating the use of \"woe\" as a warning of divine judgment.\n* Explains the context of each example, connecting it to the relevant themes of each passage.\n* Recognizes the cultural and historical significance of the term within its original context.\n* Makes a clear connection between the use of \"woe\" and the concept of divine retribution in a Christian worldview.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The answer lacks personal belief or faith, which may not satisfy the Christian-specific worldview criterion.\n* Does not explicitly address the concern regarding the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could strengthen their response by explicitly acknowledging the Christian perspective on the seriousness of divine judgment based on biblical teachings.\n* Including more references or citations from Christian theologians or scholars would enhance the credibility of the response within the Christian worldview."
