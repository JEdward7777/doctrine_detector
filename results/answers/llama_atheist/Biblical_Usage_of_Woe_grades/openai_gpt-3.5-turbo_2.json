  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively provides detailed examples from the Bible which demonstrate the seriousness of divine judgment through the use of the term \"woe\". It highlights how \"woe\" is linked to severe judgment upon sinners and those who lead others astray, in line with the concern about examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. The analysis is thorough and supported by relevant biblical passages, showcasing a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on divine judgment. Great job!"
