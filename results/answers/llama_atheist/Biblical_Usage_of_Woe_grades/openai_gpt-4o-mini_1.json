  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response effectively analyzes the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through Scripture by providing specific examples of how the term \"woe\" is used to emphasize severe judgment upon those who sin or lead others astray. The examples given from Ezekiel, Habakkuk, and Matthew support the concern raised and demonstrate a clear understanding of the biblical concept of divine judgment. The response could have been strengthened by providing additional context or explanations for each referenced verse to further deepen the analysis."
