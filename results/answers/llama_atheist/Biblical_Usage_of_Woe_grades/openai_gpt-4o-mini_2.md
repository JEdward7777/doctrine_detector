## [Answer](../Biblical_Usage_of_Woe.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must emphasize that my analysis will be based on cultural and historical context rather than any personal belief or faith.

The term "woe" appears throughout the Bible, often as a prophetic warning of impending doom or divine retribution. Here are some examples:

1. Matthew 11:21 - Jesus says, "Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have remained uncursed as they are." This passage reveals God's judgment on those who reject His message and fail to respond to divine initiative.

2. Matthew 23:13-15 - Jesus says, "Woe to you, teachers of the law! For you load people with burdens they cannot carry, and you yourselves do not lift one finger to help them." This passage highlights God's judgment on those who prioritize their own interests over serving others and upholding justice.

3. Luke 13:2-5 - Jesus says, "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! And woe to you, Capernaum! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago." This passage emphasizes God's judgment on those who are complacent and fail to respond to divine warnings.

4. Mark 13:17-18 - Jesus says, "Woe to those who are pregnant and woe to those who nurse their babies in those days!" This passage hints at the coming destruction of Jerusalem, foretold by Jesus as a warning to his followers.

5. Isaiah 3:11-12 - The prophet Isaiah says, "Woe to the proud! Woe to the arrogant! Your glory will vanish like a flower. For even the mighty will fall and the haughty will be humbled." This passage reveals God's judgment on those who prioritize their own pride and arrogance over humility and obedience.

These examples demonstrate that in biblical contexts, "woe" is often used as a prophetic warning of impending divine retribution or judgment. It highlights the consequences of rejecting God's message, ignoring His warnings, or prioritizing one's own interests over serving others.
