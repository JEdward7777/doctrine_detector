  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed exploration of the figurative uses of the term \"Zion\" in the Bible, touching on various aspects such as the city of God, heavenly realm, spiritual reality, community of faith, future hope, and symbolic representation. The student effectively demonstrates a strong understanding of the broader spiritual implications and symbolic meanings of 'Zion' in Christian theology. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher presents a more concise and focused definition of \"Zion,\" which could have been emphasized in the student's response to align more closely with the Christian-specific worldview."
