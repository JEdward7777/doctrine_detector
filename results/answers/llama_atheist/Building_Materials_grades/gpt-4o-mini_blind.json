  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times, incorporating historical and cultural contexts. The factual information presented is accurate and well-organized. However, there is a notable absence of any mention of the religious significance of altars within the biblical worldview. As grading from a Christian-specific perspective places importance on acknowledging the religious context and purpose of altars in biblical times, the response falls short in fully addressing this aspect. Additionally, the closing question delves into the cultural significance of altars but does not touch upon the spiritual or theological implications within the biblical framework."
