  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and factual answer regarding the materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times. However, the response lacked a Christian specific worldview in addressing the concern of how understanding altar materials deepens a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and worship. The inclusion of a perspective on the religious significance of altars based on a Christian worldview would have enhanced the answer."
