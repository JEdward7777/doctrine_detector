  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a good analysis of the materials commonly used in constructing altars during biblical times, incorporating additional relevant information from the student's own research. However, as a Christian, it is important to highlight the spiritual significance and symbolism associated with altars in biblical practices, which was not sufficiently addressed in the response. Discussing the religious and worship aspects tied to altars would have enhanced the Christian perspective and understanding of the topic."
