  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a comprehensive overview of various materials used in constructing altars during biblical times, aligning well with the specified concern about deepening a Christian's understanding of biblical practices. The information was well-structured and informative, even though the perspective is from an atheist worldview. The only area for improvement would be to incorporate some reflections on the spiritual significance and symbolic meanings often associated with altars in Christian belief, which could have further enhanced the Christian-specific worldview."
