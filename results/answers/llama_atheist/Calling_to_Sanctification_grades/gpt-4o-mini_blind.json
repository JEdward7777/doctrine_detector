The inclusion of relevant biblical passages like 1 Peter 1:15-16, 2 Corinthians 7:1, Romans 12:1-2, and Philippians 3:14 demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the student's stated atheistic worldview leads to a dismissal of the commands' divine authority. While acknowledging the cultural and historical impact of personal sanctification, the rejection of the foundational belief in a transcendent God undermines the theological significance of the commands given to believers. Emphasizing the importance of faith and obedience in interpreting and applying these commands would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
