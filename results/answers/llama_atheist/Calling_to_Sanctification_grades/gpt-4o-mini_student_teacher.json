  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough explanation of the Christian concept of personal sanctification from a historical and cultural perspective, they fail to address the concern of emphasizing personal responsibility in the sanctification process. The student's response lacks a recognition of believers' active role in their sanctification journey as commanded by God. A Christian worldview would prioritize personal responsibility in striving for holiness, aligning with God's will."
