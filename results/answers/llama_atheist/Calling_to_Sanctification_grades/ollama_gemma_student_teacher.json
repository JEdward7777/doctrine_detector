  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a thorough and well-researched response that carefully considers the question from both a theological and cultural perspective. They accurately identify relevant biblical passages and explain their significance in Christian theology. However, the student's rejection of the divine authority of the commands undermines the applicability of their analysis for believers. Nonetheless, their cultural and historical analysis adds depth to the discussion."
