It also acknowledges the cultural and historical significance of this concept in shaping Western moral and spiritual values.\n\nHowever, while the response does touch on the importance of self-reflection and good works in the sanctification process, it could be more explicit in emphasizing personal responsibility. For example, the author notes that believers are \"commanded to strive for holiness\" and \"to offer their bodies as a living sacrifice,\" but they do not explicitly state that this is a matter of personal choice and responsibility.\n\nThat being said, the response does make clear that sanctification is not something that can be imposed from outside, but rather requires an individual's active participation and commitment. The author notes that believers are called to \"strive for holiness\" and \"press on toward the uprightness that is mine through Jesus Christ,\" which implies a level of personal agency and responsibility.\n\nOverall, while the response could be more explicit in emphasizing personal responsibility, it provides a solid foundation for understanding the concept of personal sanctification and its cultural significance."
