From a Christian-specific viewpoint, faith is not merely about believing in divine power, but about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. Additionally, the analysis could have explored how Jesus' response and actions in this passage align with his overall message of the kingdom of God and the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation. Incorporating these aspects would have strengthened the argument and demonstrated a deeper understanding of the nature of faith and authority in the context of Jesus' ministry."
