It effectively addresses the concern regarding the mission of the Church to reach all nations and the inclusivity of the Gospel, highlighting key points such as the universal nature of the Gospel, the breaking down of cultural barriers by the Holy Spirit, and the inclusive vision of Jesus' teachings. The connection between the event and God's love and salvation for all people is well-explained and supported with scriptural references. Great job presenting a Christian worldview perspective on this biblical event."
