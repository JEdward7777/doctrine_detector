However, as an atheist, the perspective lacks an understanding of the theological implications and importance of the centurion's declaration as it relates to Christian beliefs in the divinity of Jesus Christ. The answer could be improved by delving deeper into the doctrinal significance of the centurion's proclamation within Christian theology."
