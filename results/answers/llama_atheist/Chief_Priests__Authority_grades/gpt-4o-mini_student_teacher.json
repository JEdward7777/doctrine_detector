  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-researched answer discussing the relationship between chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Israel. However, the student's answer focused more on historical and archaeological evidence rather than specifically addressing the authority aspect. From a Christian worldview, the key point is that the chief priests held a higher rank and power than the ordinary priests, with the high priest having the most authority. While the student's answer provided context and background information, it lacked a clear and explicit mention of this fundamental Christian perspective on the hierarchy of authority within the priestly class."
