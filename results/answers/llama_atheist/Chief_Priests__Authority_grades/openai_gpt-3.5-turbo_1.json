The answer aligns well with the given answer regarding the hierarchy within the priesthood. However, as a Christian worldview concern, it would have been beneficial to incorporate references to the biblical significance and divine establishment of this hierarchical structure, emphasizing God's role in appointing and guiding the leadership within the priesthood. This perspective would enhance the understanding of how the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel reflects divine order and purpose."
