  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between chief priests (Kohanim) and ordinary priests (Levites) in ancient Israelite society, aligning well with the given answer. It references biblical accounts and archaeological findings to support the conclusion that the chief priests held higher rank and power than ordinary priests. However, the response could have further emphasized the religious significance and spiritual aspects of the hierarchy, drawing more explicitly on a Christian worldview to deepen the analysis. Overall, a strong evaluation of the religious leadership structure in ancient Israel."
