  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the relationship between chief priests (Kohanim) and ordinary priests (Levites) in ancient Israelite society, aligning well with the Christian worldview's understanding of religious leadership during that time. The explanation is well-researched, supported by biblical references and archaeological evidence, and effectively addresses the concern regarding the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel. The deductive point was clearly articulated and supported by relevant information. Great job!"
