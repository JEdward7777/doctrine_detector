  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does a good job of providing detailed historical and biblical evidence to support the claim that the chief priests (Kohanim) held higher rank and authority over ordinary priests (Levites) in ancient Israelite society. The information presented aligns well with a Christian worldview's understanding of the religious leadership structure in ancient Israel. The response could have been strengthened by making explicit connections to the significance of this religious hierarchy within the broader context of biblical teachings and faith practices."
