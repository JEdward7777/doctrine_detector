The key points are well-articulated and the potential positive and negative consequences are thoroughly explored. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing how this understanding could deepen one's faith and sense of belonging in the Christian community. However, as an atheistic scholar, the perspective could have delved deeper into how this understanding may impact actual faith and belief in God rather than focusing solely on the cultural and philosophical aspects."
