  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and well-researched analysis of how the term \"Christ\" evolved in its usage throughout the New Testament. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the historical context and linguistic developments. The answer could be strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references to support the points made and by connecting the evolution of the term \"Christ\" to broader theological implications within Christian doctrine. Additionally, highlighting the significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response. Overall, a solid exploration of the topic with room for deeper theological analysis."
