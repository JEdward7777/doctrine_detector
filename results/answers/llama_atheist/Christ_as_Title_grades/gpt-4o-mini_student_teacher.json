  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-researched explanation of how the term \"Christ\" evolved in its usage throughout the New Testament, acknowledging the historical context and linguistic developments. The answer effectively explores the transition of the term from a descriptive title to a personal name emphasizing Jesus' unique status and mission. The response aligns with the concern by discussing the significance of the title 'Christ' in deepening understanding of Jesus's identity and purpose. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and directly addressed the key points provided in the reference answer. A slightly more focused approach would have improved the overall clarity and coherence of the response."
