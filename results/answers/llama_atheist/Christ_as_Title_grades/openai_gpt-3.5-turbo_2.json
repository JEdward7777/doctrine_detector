The historical context and linguistic developments are well-analyzed, contributing to a deeper understanding of the term's significance. The discussion effectively addresses the concern by elucidating how recognizing the title 'Christ' enhances comprehension of Jesus's identity and purpose. The response could further enhance its Christian-specific worldview by explicitly connecting the significance of the term 'Christ' to core Christian beliefs, such as Jesus being the Son of God and the Messiah foretold in the Old Testament."
