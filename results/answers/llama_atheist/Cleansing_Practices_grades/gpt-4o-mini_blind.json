As a Christian worldview is being prioritized, it is essential for answers to be rooted in biblical teachings and doctrines. The response from an atheist perspective misses the opportunity to highlight the significance of ritual cleanliness in connection to Christian faith and the symbolism it carries within the belief system. Encouraging personal hygiene, shared meals, stewardship of creation, mindfulness, personal growth, hospitality, and sacred spaces are all good ideas, but they need to be explicitly tied back to the fundamental truths and teachings of Christianity to truly reflect the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness in a Christian context."
