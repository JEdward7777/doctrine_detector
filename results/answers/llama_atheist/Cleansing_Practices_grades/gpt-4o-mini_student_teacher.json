  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70. While the student provided thoughtful and creative ideas for modern Christians to reflect on the concept of ritual cleanliness from the Old Testament, their answer did not directly address the concern of enhancing spiritual growth and accountability. The student's suggestions focused more on cultural and practical adaptations rather than deeply spiritual practices such as repentance, confession, and discipline as outlined in the reference answer. The student's answer would have been stronger if it had included more explicit spiritual practices aligned with the given concern."
