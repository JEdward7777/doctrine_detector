  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the concern provided, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clear conscience for spiritual health and alignment with God's will. The student's secular interpretation lacks a Christian worldview perspective and dismisses the core concept of obedience to God as the basis for a clear conscience in Christian teachings. The response also relies heavily on humanistic values and individual autonomy, which contradicts the Christian belief in divine authority."
