  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nWhile the student's answer is well-written and provides a comprehensive analysis of the concept of a \"clear conscience\" from a secular perspective, it does not fully address the Christian-specific concern of aligning one's conscience with God's will. The student's answer emphasizes self-awareness, moral integrity, and accountability, but it does not explicitly address the idea of sin or forgiveness, which are central to Christian teachings about a clear conscience."
