However, it falls short in fully addressing the concern about spiritual health and alignment with God's will.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge that Christian teachings often link a clear conscience to being \"right with God,\" it primarily focuses on human moral agency rather than exploring how this concept relates to one's relationship with God. The concern specifically emphasizes maintaining a clear conscience for spiritual health and alignment with God's will, which is not fully addressed in this response.\n\nTo improve, the response could have more explicitly connected the secular understanding of having a clear conscience to the Christian concept of being \"right with God\" and how this relates to one's spiritual health and alignment with God's will."
