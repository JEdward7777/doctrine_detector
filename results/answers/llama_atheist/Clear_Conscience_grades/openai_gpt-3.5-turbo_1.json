  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided completely disregards the Christian-specific understanding of having a \"clear conscience\" and instead presents a secular perspective that downplays the importance of obedience to God and aligning with His will. The student fails to address the concern that maintaining a clear conscience is vital for spiritual health and alignment with God's will, which is essential from a Christian worldview. The response lacks theological depth and fails to acknowledge the significance of God's authority in shaping one's conscience."
