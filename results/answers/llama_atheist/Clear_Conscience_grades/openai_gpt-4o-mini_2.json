However, it dismisses the Christian understanding that a clear conscience involves being in obedience to God and not hiding sin, which is crucial for spiritual health and alignment with God's will. From a Christian worldview, true moral agency and growth are found in aligning one's conscience with God's Word and seeking forgiveness through Jesus Christ."
