  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student did provide comprehensive examples of compassion demonstrated in the Bible and accurately described the stories of Ruth and Naomi, Job, Jesus, and Lazarus, there is a concern with their interpretation. The student stated their lack of faith in divine intervention, which is essential to understanding and truly recognizing compassion as modeled by biblical figures. In a Christian worldview, acknowledging divine intervention is crucial to fully grasp the depth and significance of biblical compassion. Therefore, while the student's examples are valid, the lack of recognition of divine influence in these acts of compassion hinders their understanding and interpretation from a Christian perspective."
