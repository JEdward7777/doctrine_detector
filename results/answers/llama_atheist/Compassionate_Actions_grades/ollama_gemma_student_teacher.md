## [Answer](../Compassionate_Actions.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I can certainly examine the biblical accounts of compassionate individuals, despite my own lack of faith in divine intervention.

One notable example is the story of Ruth and Naomi (Ruth 1:16-17). After Naomi's husband dies, her sons take foreign wives, which ultimately leads to their deaths. Naomi loses her entire family, leaving her alone and destitute. Ruth, who was Naomi's daughter-in-law, chooses to abandon her own culture and people to stay with Naomi, showing remarkable compassion and loyalty.

Another example is the story of Job (Job 19:13-14). Despite being afflicted with chronic pain and losing his children and possessions, Job remains faithful to God and shows compassion towards his friends Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, who come to console him. Job's friends offer little comfort, but Job continues to show kindness and understanding towards them.

In the New Testament, Jesus' life is full of examples of compassion. He heals the sick (Matthew 8:1-3), feeds the hungry (Matthew 15:32-38), and shows mercy to those considered outcasts by society, such as tax collectors and prostitutes (Luke 7:36-50).

The story of Lazarus in John 11:1-44 is another example. Jesus receives news that his friend Lazarus has fallen ill, but he delays traveling to Bethany until four days after Lazarus' death. When Jesus arrives, he finds Mary and Martha mourning their brother's passing. Jesus is moved by their grief and shows compassion by raising Lazarus from the dead.

These biblical accounts demonstrate that individuals within the biblical narratives have shown compassion towards others, often in the face of adversity or hardship. As a scholar, I can acknowledge these examples without necessarily ascribing them to divine intervention.
