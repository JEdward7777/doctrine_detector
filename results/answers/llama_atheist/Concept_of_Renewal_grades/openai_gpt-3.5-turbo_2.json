However, the analysis predominantly focuses on secular interpretations and historical practices rather than delving deeply into the transformative power of faith and God's ongoing work in a believer's life, which was the specified concern. The response could have better integrated the transformative aspect of restoration in Christian theology with a more explicit reference to God's role in renewing believers."
