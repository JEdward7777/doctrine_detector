## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
What a fascinating question! As an atheistic scholar, I must acknowledge that I don't rely on religious texts for my understanding of the world. However, I can certainly engage with your inquiry from a secular perspective.

Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 are both passages that contain teachings about punishment and condemnation. From a secular standpoint, it's essential to separate these passages' historical and cultural context from our contemporary understanding of justice and morality.

In Matthew 12:7, Jesus says, "And if you had learned to say good things when abuse was going on, then you would have been teachers by now for the people of Israel." This passage is often interpreted as Jesus condemning the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders who were critical of his teachings. In this context, punishment is not about retribution or condemnation but rather about calling out hypocrisy and encouraging moral growth.

In Psalms 34:22, we find a passage that says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled." This verse can be seen as a call to pursue justice and morality, rather than seeking punishment or condemnation. The idea is that by striving for righteousness, one will ultimately experience fulfillment.

From a secular perspective, these passages highlight the importance of moral growth and personal development over punitive measures. They suggest that our focus should be on becoming better versions of ourselves through education, self-reflection, and positive reinforcement rather than relying solely on punishment as a means of correction.

In modern times, we've come to recognize the limitations and potential harm caused by punitive approaches to justice. Instead, many advocate for restorative justice, rehabilitation programs, and community-based initiatives that focus on healing, growth, and redemption. These approaches prioritize building stronger communities over simply punishing individuals who have committed wrongs.

Ultimately, while these biblical passages may not directly inform my secular perspective, they do share common themes with modern secular values. By emphasizing personal growth, moral development, and a focus on positive reinforcement, we can create a more just and compassionate society that prioritizes rehabilitation and redemption over punishment and condemnation.
