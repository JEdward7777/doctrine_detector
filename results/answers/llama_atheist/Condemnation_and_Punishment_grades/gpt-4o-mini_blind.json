  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: This response, while well-written and thoughtful, falls short in addressing the specific teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 from a Christian worldview. It primarily focuses on a secular perspective and does not engage deeply with the doctrinal implications of these biblical passages. To improve the grade, the student should delve into the theological significance of the verses in shaping the Christian perspective on punishment and condemnation, incorporating key principles of Christian faith and doctrine."
