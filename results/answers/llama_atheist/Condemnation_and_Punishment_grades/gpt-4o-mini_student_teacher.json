  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough analysis and interpretation of the biblical passages in question from a secular perspective, they did not effectively address the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. The answer primarily focused on moral growth and personal development, lacking a Christian-specific viewpoint on the concept of punishment as a form of condemnation. Additionally, the student did not incorporate the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasized God's value of mercy over sacrifice and protection from condemnation.\n\nOverall, the student's response was well-written and informative from a secular standpoint but fell short of addressing the specified concern from a Christian worldview."
