While the secular approach offers valuable insights on justice and morality, it lacks a clear integration of the concepts of divine justice and mercy, as requested in the concern. A Christian worldview would emphasize how God's justice and mercy are intertwined in the context of punishment, which could have been further explored in relation to the provided biblical passages."
