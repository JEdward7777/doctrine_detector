The student appropriately discusses the passages from Matthew and Psalms in a secular context, highlighting the importance of moral growth and personal development. However, a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview and the concept of divine justice and mercy could have been further emphasized to strengthen the response. Additionally, integrating more explicit references to the sacrificial nature of Christ's atonement and how it influences views on punishment would have enhanced the analysis within a Christian worldview."
