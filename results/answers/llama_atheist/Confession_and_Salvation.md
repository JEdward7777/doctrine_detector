As a scholar, I'll delve into the nuances of Paul's writings on this topic.

In Pauline theology, "confessing that Jesus is Lord" (Romans 10:9-13, Philippians 2:5-11) and being saved are intricately connected. When Paul says "Jesus is Lord," he's emphasizing the ontological priority of Christ over all other authorities, including human ones.

For Paul, confessing Jesus as Lord means acknowledging His supreme sovereignty over the cosmos, humanity, and one's own life. This declaration is not just a verbal formula but an existential commitment to submit to Christ's lordship. In essence, it's an act of obedience to God's revelation in Christ, which supersedes all other allegiances.

Being saved, then, is not merely a matter of confessing the right words or performing certain rituals; rather, it's an experiential outcome of living under Christ's lordship. For Paul, salvation is a process that begins with faith (e.g., Romans 1:16-17), which is itself an act of submission to God's revelation in Jesus Christ.

In this context, "being saved" encompasses various aspects:

1. Justification: Being declared righteous by God due to one's faith in Christ's redemptive work (Romans 3:24-26).
2. Regeneration: The Holy Spirit's transformative power, which regenerates the heart and enables a new existence under Christ's lordship (Titus 3:5, Ephesians 2:1-10).
3. Sanctification: The ongoing process of becoming more like Christ as one yields to His lordship and allows His Spirit to shape their thoughts, emotions, and actions (Romans 6:11-13, Philippians 2:12-13).

In summary, Paul's writings suggest that confessing Jesus is Lord is an essential step toward being saved. This confession involves a commitment to submit to Christ's supreme authority and live under His lordship. As one makes this declaration, they're opening themselves up to the transformative power of God's salvation, which encompasses justification, regeneration, and sanctification.

It's worth noting that Paul's teachings on salvation are not limited to these specific texts but can be found throughout his Epistles, particularly in Romans, Ephesians, Philippians, and Galatians. As scholars, we must approach these complex themes with a nuanced understanding of the historical and cultural contexts in which they were written.
