  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive overview of how a Christian should resist temptation based on biblical references but fails to address the crucial aspect of confessing sins and seeking God's forgiveness. The importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness is a central aspect of the Christian worldview when dealing with temptation. The student's answer, although informative, lacks the essential emphasis on confession and seeking forgiveness in the context of God's grace and strength."
