  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical concept of conscience within a Christian worldview. The response intelligently explores the various aspects of conscience, including its connection to the heart, moral awareness, and its influence on behavior. The inclusion of relevant biblical passages further strengthens the argument. However, the student could improve their grade by providing more direct engagement with the given concern, which emphasizes the importance of understanding conscience for moral decision-making in a Christian context."
