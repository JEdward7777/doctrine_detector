  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of conscience, citing relevant biblical passages and explaining its role in guiding individuals toward righteousness and away from sin. The author effectively breaks down the concept into its various functions, including inner witness, moral awareness, guilt and shame, motivation for change, and sanctification.\n\nThe only areas where the response falls short are in its clarity and depth of explanation. At times, the language is overly academic or vague, which can make it difficult to fully grasp the concepts being discussed. Additionally, some sections feel a bit disconnected from the main topic, such as the discussion of Stephen's conscience in Acts 7:47-50.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical concept of conscience and its importance in Christian moral decision-making. With some refinement to address these areas, it could be an even stronger response."
