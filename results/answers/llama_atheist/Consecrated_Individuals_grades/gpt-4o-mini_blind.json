  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and well-rounded response by listing various individuals from the Bible who were consecrated to God, including key details about each person's consecration and significance in the biblical narrative. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of consecration and incorporates relevant scripture references. However, to enhance the grade further, the student could have included more Old Testament figures like Moses, Elijah, and Isaiah, who were also consecrated and called by God for specific purposes."
