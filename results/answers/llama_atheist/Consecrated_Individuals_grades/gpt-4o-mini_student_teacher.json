  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response, listing specific individuals from the Bible who were consecrated to God and explaining their significance. While the student included additional examples beyond what was mentioned in the reference answer, they accurately addressed the concern about the significance of consecrated individuals in biblical history. However, the answer could have been improved by directly citing the priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child as mentioned in the reference answer."
