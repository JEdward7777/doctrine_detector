  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of consecration from both philosophical and sociological perspectives. The student provides a well-reasoned and well-supported analysis of the act of consecration as a spiritual preparation or initiation that aims to purify, instill a sense of purpose, and grant special powers for service to God. The student's critical thinking and avoidance of unwarranted assumptions or uncritical acceptance of religious dogma are commendable."
