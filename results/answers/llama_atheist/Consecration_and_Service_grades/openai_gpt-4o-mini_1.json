However, it fails to fully address the concern about the purification process in relation to consecration from a Christian worldview. While it acknowledges the cleansing aspect briefly, a more in-depth exploration of how purification is central to consecration as part of preparing individuals or things for service to God would have strengthened the response. Additionally, the perspective on religious dogma and lack of empirical evidence could be viewed as dismissive of faith-based practices, which is a key aspect within a Christian framework."
