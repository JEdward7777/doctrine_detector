  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the biblical passages and their relevance to the concept of pride and humility. They provide clear examples from scripture to support their claims, and their secular analysis adds depth and relevance to the discussion. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct engagement with the teacher's reference answer, which explicitly connects the concepts of pride and humility with God's action."
