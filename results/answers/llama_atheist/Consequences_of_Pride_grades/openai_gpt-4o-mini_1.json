The focus on secular perspectives neglects to acknowledge the foundational importance of God's role in humbling the proud and exalting the humble, which is crucial when considering pride and humility within a Christian worldview. Integrating spiritual truths and acknowledging the ultimate authority of God's teachings would significantly enhance the response from a Christian perspective."
