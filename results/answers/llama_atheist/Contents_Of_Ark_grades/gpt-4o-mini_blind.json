The perspective presented disregards the sacred and foundational beliefs held by Christians regarding the Ark, its contents, and their significance within the biblical narrative. The emphasis on atheism and skepticism detracts from a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter from a Christian perspective. In future responses, it would be beneficial to focus more on presenting the information in alignment with Christian beliefs and doctrine."
