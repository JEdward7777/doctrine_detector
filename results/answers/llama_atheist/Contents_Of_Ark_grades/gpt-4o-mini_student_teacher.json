However, the response lacks a direct focus on the items contained within the Ark as a reminder of God's covenant with the Israelites. From a Christian worldview perspective, it is essential to prioritize the significance of the items stored in the Ark within the context of God's covenant rather than solely approaching it from a secular or atheistic standpoint."
