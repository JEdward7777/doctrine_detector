  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer provides some insightful perspectives on identifying corrupt influences in the world, focusing on systemic injustices and societal issues. However, the answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview in addressing the concern of remaining vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living. The student did not incorporate biblical teachings or the promotion of virtues like selflessness and righteousness in their response. Encouraging the student to align their analysis more closely with Christian principles and values would enhance the grade."
