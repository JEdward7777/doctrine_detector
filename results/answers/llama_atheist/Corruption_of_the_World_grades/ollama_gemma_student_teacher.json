They provide a comprehensive list of factors to consider, including power dynamics, financial corruption, environmental degradation, cultural biases, manipulation of information, and the exploitation of the vulnerable. \n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from further elaboration on how these factors align with biblical teachings and Christian values.
