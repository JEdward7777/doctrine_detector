While the suggestions align with promoting justice and fairness, they lack a direct connection to biblical teachings and the concern of remaining vigilant against worldly influences that may lead away from godly living. From a Christian worldview, it would be beneficial to emphasize the importance of aligning actions with Biblical principles and discerning influences that contradict these teachings. Additionally, integrating the concept of sin and selfishness as viewed through the lens of Christianity would further enhance the response."
