The response focused more on identifying corrupt influences from a societal perspective rather than emphasizing the importance of aligning behavior and attitudes with biblical teachings and combating sinful tendencies. More emphasis on the spiritual aspect of discernment and the importance of staying true to biblical principles in identifying corrupt influences would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
