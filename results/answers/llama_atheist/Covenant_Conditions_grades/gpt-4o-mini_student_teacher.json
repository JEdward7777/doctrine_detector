  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided detailed examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, their analysis lacked a Christian-specific worldview. As a Christian, it is important to understand that conditional covenants in the Bible demonstrate the dynamics of God's promises and expectations for obedience from His people. The student's response, while informative, did not address this concern adequately from a Christian perspective."
