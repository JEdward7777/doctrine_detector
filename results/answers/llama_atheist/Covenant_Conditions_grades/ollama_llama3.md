## [Answer](../Covenant_Conditions.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A most excellent question, my friend! As an athiest scholar, I must approach this topic with a critical eye, recognizing that religious texts like the Bible can be both culturally significant and historically fascinating. With that said, let's dive into some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible.

Conditional Covenants:

1. The Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 19-24): This covenant between God and the Israelites was contingent upon their obedience to God's laws and commandments. If they failed to follow God's laws, the consequences would be severe, including exile or even destruction.
2. The Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7:1-17; Psalm 89:1-37): This covenant between God and King David was conditional upon David's descendants keeping God's commandments and following His statutes. If they failed to do so, the consequences would be dire, including the loss of the throne.
3. The New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:6-13): This covenant between God and Israel was conditional upon their turning from sin and obeying God's laws. If they did not turn from sin, the consequences would be severe, including judgment and exile.

Unconditional Covenants:

1. The Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 12:1-3; 15:1-21): This covenant between God and Abraham was unconditional, meaning that it was based on God's promise rather than human performance. God promised to make Abraham the father of a great nation, regardless of Abraham's obedience or disobedience.
2. The Priestly Covenant (Leviticus 8:1-36; Numbers 25:10-13): This covenant between God and the priests was unconditional, as it was based on God's choice rather than human performance. God chose the priests to serve Him, regardless of their obedience or disobedience.
3. The Covenant with Noah (Genesis 9:8-17): This covenant between God and Noah was unconditional, as it was based on God's promise rather than human performance. God promised never again to destroy the earth by a flood, regardless of humanity's behavior.

In conclusion, the Bible presents both conditional and unconditional covenants. Conditional covenants are tied to human obedience or disobedience, while unconditional covenants are based solely on God's promise or choice. As an athiest scholar, I recognize that these covenantal relationships have had significant cultural and historical impact, shaping the beliefs and practices of many societies throughout history.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, providing examples from different biblical accounts. It also attempts to analyze the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in these covenants, recognizing that conditional covenants are tied to human obedience or disobedience, while unconditional covenants are based solely on God's promise or choice.

However, the response falls short of fully understanding the concern, as it only scratches the surface of exploring the implications of God's promises and expectations in covenants. The explanation is mostly descriptive, without delving deeper into the theological significance or practical applications of these concepts.

Additionally, the response may benefit from a more nuanced discussion of the relationship between God's sovereignty and human responsibility in conditional covenants.
