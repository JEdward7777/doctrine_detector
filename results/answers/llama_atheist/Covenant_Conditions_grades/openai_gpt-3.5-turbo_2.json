The discussion on how conditional covenants are tied to human obedience and how unconditional covenants are based on God's promise or choice aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the mention of being an atheist scholar and the absence of acknowledging the theological implications of these covenants within Christian belief could be seen as a limitation from a Christian perspective."
