However, the perspective of an atheist scholar, while presented respectfully, may not fully align with a Christian worldview that acknowledges God's sovereignty and authority in establishing and fulfilling covenants. Integrating a Christian perspective on how these covenants reveal God's character and plan for redemption would enhance the response."
