  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 40.\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed and well-researched explanation of the biblical concept of covenants from a historical and cultural perspective. However, the response lacks a Christian worldview and understanding of the spiritual significance of covenants in the Bible. From a Christian perspective, covenants are not merely cultural or historical agreements, but sacred and relational commitments orchestrated by God for His people. The student's analysis, while informative, falls short in conveying the spiritual depth and divine intentionality behind biblical covenants."
