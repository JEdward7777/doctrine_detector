However, as an atheistic scholar, the response lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not fully address the concern of understanding the biblical concept of covenant in relation to God's relationship with humanity. While the analysis is insightful and well-articulated, the perspective presented is secular rather than reflecting a Christian understanding of covenant faithfulness."
