The explanation focuses on reinterpreting God's laws as mere societal norms and customs, disregarding the foundational belief in the divine authority behind the commandments. Additionally, it overlooks the theological significance and the covenantal relationship between God and the Israelites, which is central to understanding the biblical narrative. From a Christian perspective, the obedience to God's laws is not metaphorical but a fundamental aspect of faith and demonstrating trust and reverence towards God."
