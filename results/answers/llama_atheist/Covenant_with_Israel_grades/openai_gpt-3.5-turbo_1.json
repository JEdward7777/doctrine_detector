The response mainly stays within a secular scholarly perspective and does not emphasize the spiritual significance of the covenant between God and the Israelites as seen through the lens of faith. A Christian worldview would highlight the loving and faithful nature of God in establishing a covenant with His chosen people, illustrating his sovereign will and plan for redemption through Jesus Christ."
