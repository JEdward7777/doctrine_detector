  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provides a comprehensive analysis of biblical covenants and their significance, their approach lacks the recognition of the overarching narrative of redemption in the Bible. The response tends to focus more on historical and literary aspects rather than emphasizing God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture. Encouraging the student to incorporate a Christian worldview perspective to further enhance their understanding of the topic."
