## [Answer](../Cultural_Practices.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
The Jewish view of Gentiles, or non-Jews, has a rich and complex history that had significant impacts on early Christianity. In ancient Judaism, Gentiles were viewed as being outside the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This distinction is reflected in various cultural practices and theological beliefs.

One significant practice was the concept of "clean" and "unclean." The Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) outlined rules for dietary laws, purity laws, and moral codes that applied only to Jews. Gentiles were not expected to follow these laws, as they were considered "other" and outside the covenant community. This cultural practice created a sense of separation between Jews and Gentiles.

Another significant practice was the idea of "separation" or "holiness." Jewish tradition emphasized the importance of keeping oneself separate from non-Jews (and even from other impure things) to maintain spiritual purity. This led to strict laws around social interactions, clothing, and even food preparation. For example, Jews would not eat with Gentiles or share meals together.

These cultural practices had significant impacts on early Christian communities:

1. Separation from the synagogue: Early Christians saw themselves as part of a new community that superseded traditional Jewish practices. As they separated from the synagogue, they also began to distance themselves from Gentile culture.
2. Evangelization and apologetics: The apostles and early Christians developed apologetic strategies to explain their faith to Gentiles. This led to the development of missionary theology and practices, such as Paul's arguments in Romans 9-11.
3. Church organization and governance: As Christian communities grew, they began to develop new forms of governance that were distinct from Jewish traditions. The separation between "clean" and "unclean" created a sense of distance from traditional Jewish authority structures.
4. Scripture and tradition: Early Christians developed their own scriptural canon, which was distinct from the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament). This led to a focus on the New Testament and the Gospels as authoritative texts for Christian practice.
5. Inculturation and contextualization: As Christianity spread to Gentile cultures, early Christians faced the challenge of adapting their faith to new contexts. This process, known as inculturation, required them to engage with non-Jewish customs and practices in creative ways.

In conclusion, the Jewish view of Gentiles had significant cultural and theological impacts on early Christian practices. The separation between "clean" and "unclean," the emphasis on separation and holiness, and the development of apologetic strategies all shaped the early Christian community's identity and mission.
