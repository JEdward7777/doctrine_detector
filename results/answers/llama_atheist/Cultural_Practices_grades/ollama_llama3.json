  "grade": 92.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 92.\n\nThis response thoroughly explores the Jewish view of Gentiles and its impact on early Christianity, providing specific examples and cultural practices that support its claims. The writer demonstrates a strong understanding of the historical context and theological implications of these cultural norms on faith communities and their practices.\n\nThe response also effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how the initial avoidance of eating with or associating with Gentiles created barriers in the early church, prompting discussions about inclusivity and acceptance. This shows that the writer has thoughtfully considered how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be even more explicit in drawing connections between these historical cultural norms and their ongoing impact on Christian practices today. However, overall, this response provides a rich and detailed exploration of the topic and demonstrates a strong understanding of the complexities involved.\n\nComment: This response is well-organized, well-supported, and effectively addresses the concern. The writer's use of specific examples and cultural practices adds depth and richness to the discussion."
