However, it falls short in recognizing the theological implications and the connection to God's judgment on disobedient people. The analysis lacks a firm grounding in a Christian worldview and does not emphasize the centrality of Christ in understanding salvation and judgment. The secular approach and avoidance of theological biases hinder a deeper exploration of the passage's significance within Christianity. Further integration of scriptural truths and theological insights would significantly enhance the response."
