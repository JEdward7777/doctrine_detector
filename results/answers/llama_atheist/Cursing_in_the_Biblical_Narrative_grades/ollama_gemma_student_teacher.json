  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the cultural and theological contexts surrounding the curse on the snake in Genesis 3:14. They provide a nuanced analysis of the symbolic significance of the serpent in ancient Mesopotamian culture and convincingly argue that the curse functions as a metaphor for the consequences of human disobedience in the natural world. \n\nThe student's willingness to challenge the traditional theological interpretation of the curse and explore it from an atheistic perspective is commendable. Their ability to connect the narrative to broader themes of sin and redemption while acknowledging the limitations of applying modern concepts to ancient texts showcases their critical thinking skills."
