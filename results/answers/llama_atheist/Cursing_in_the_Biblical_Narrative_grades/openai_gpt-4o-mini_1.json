While the analysis of the curse on the snake in its ancient Near Eastern context is informative, it overlooks the central Christian understanding of sin and redemption through Christ. The atheistic perspective presented does not address the theological significance of sin and the need for redemption as foundational elements of Christian belief. A Christian perspective would emphasize the fall of humanity into sin through disobedience, the consequences of this separation from God, and the redemptive work of Christ on the cross to reconcile humanity with God."
