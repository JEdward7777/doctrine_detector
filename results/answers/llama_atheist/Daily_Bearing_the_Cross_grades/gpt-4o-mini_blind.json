Without acknowledging the foundational belief that Jesus' death on the cross was for the forgiveness of sins and that believers are called to follow his sacrificial example, the answer falls short in providing a truly Christian worldview interpretation. To improve, the student should incorporate the key theological significance of the cross and its relation to self-denial, sacrifice, and discipleship as taught in Christianity."
