However, the answer strayed away from the Christian-specific understanding by not focusing on the personal cost of following Christ and the call to discipleship. The perspective provided lacks the recognition of the centrality of Jesus and obedience to God's will in the interpretation of this biblical concept. An improvement would be to integrate more explicitly the Christian worldview focus on self-sacrifice and commitment to following Jesus in the analysis."
