However, the inclusion of perspectives from an atheist worldview may dilute the focus on the Christian-specific interpretation and could potentially lead to confusion regarding the intended biblical meaning. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern raised by highlighting the call to discipleship and the personal cost of following Christ, but could benefit from a more focused presentation of the Christian perspective."
