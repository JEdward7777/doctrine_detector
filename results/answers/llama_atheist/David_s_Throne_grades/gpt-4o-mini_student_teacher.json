  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the promise of David's throne lasting forever, discussing its historical context and significance in Christian theology. However, the student's approach as an atheist and emphasis on historical-critical perspective detracts from the Christian-specific worldview necessary to understand the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus. The student acknowledges the Messianic interpretation but could better highlight the centrality of Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of this promise in Christian theology."
