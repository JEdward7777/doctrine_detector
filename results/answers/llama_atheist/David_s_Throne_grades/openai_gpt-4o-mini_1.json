The focus on the promise symbolizing God's eternal covenant and sovereignty, specifically through Jesus as David's descendant, aligns well with the Christian worldview. However, the perspective of the author as an atheist may introduce limitations in fully emphasizing the importance of recognizing the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus. It would be beneficial for the author to further explore and affirm the Christian belief in the Messianic fulfillment of this promise, rather than presenting it as one interpretation among many."
