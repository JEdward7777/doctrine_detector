## [Answer](../Day_of_the_Lord_Meaning.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that has puzzled many a biblical scholar for centuries!

In the New Testament, the phrase "day of the Lord" (Greek: ἡ ἡμέρα τοῦ κυρίου) is used to refer to a specific event or period when God's judgment and redemption will be fully revealed. This concept is rooted in Jewish apocalyptic traditions and is closely tied to the prophetic literature of the Old Testament.

In the New Testament, "the day of the Lord" is often associated with the second coming of Jesus Christ (e.g., 1 Thessalonians 5:2; 2 Peter 3:10). It's a time when God will intervene in human history, bringing an end to human domination and establishing His own kingdom. This event is characterized by various signs and wonders, such as the sun being darkened, stars falling, and the moon not giving its light (Joel 2:31; Matthew 24:29).

In a more general sense, "the day of the Lord" also refers to any moment when God's judgment or salvation is manifest. For instance, in Acts 2:20-21, Peter connects Jesus' crucifixion with "the day of the Lord," emphasizing that this event marked the beginning of the end times.

Some scholars have noted a possible distinction between two types of "days" in the New Testament:

1. A universal judgment, where God intervenes in human history to punish or reward humanity (e.g., 2 Thessalonians 2:4; Revelation 6:17).
2. A specific event or period within that larger framework, often associated with Jesus' return or a particular apocalyptic scenario (e.g., 1 Corinthians 5:5; 2 Peter 3:7-13).

In any case, the "day of the Lord" in the New Testament is a call to repentance and faithfulness, as it represents a pivotal moment when God's plan for human salvation will be fulfilled.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to return to my research on the cultural influences that shaped early Christian thought...
