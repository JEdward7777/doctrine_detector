Additionally, the student acknowledges the diverse interpretations of the event, including both universal judgment and specific scenarios.\n\nThe inclusion of textual references from various passages strengthens the argument and demonstrates the student's familiarity with the relevant biblical material. \n\nHowever, minor deductions are made for the slightly disjointed explanation of the two possible types of \"days\" and the abrupt conclusion without further elaboration on the cultural influences mentioned."
