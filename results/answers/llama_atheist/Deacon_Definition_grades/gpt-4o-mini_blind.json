The response, being from an atheistic perspective, lacks the doctrinal foundation necessary to fully grasp the primary role of a deacon as outlined in Christian theology. The student did well in highlighting the general support, assistance, representative, and service-oriented aspects of a deacon, but a deeper understanding of the biblical mandate and spiritual significance of the deaconate would enhance the response."
