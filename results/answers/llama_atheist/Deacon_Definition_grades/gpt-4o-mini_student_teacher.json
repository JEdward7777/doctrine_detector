  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated secular perspective on the role of a deacon in a local church, focusing on various practical aspects like ministerial support, practical assistance, representative role, and a service-oriented mindset. However, the student failed to address the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. From a Christian worldview, the primary role of a deacon is rooted in serving fellow believers with practical needs, as exemplified in the reference answer. The student's answer did not adequately reflect this biblical perspective, leading to a lower grade."
