  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** While the student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the multifaceted role of deacons, it lacks a clear connection to the Christian worldview or the specific concern of servanthood. The reference answer provided suggests a more narrow focus on practical assistance, which is only partially addressed in the student's response. The student's secular perspective and lack of theological understanding limit the depth of their analysis."
