The explanation focused on practical support and service-oriented aspects, which align with the general concept of servanthood. However, the response did not incorporate a Christian-specific worldview or mention the biblical foundation of the deacon's role in serving others. Integrating scriptural references or theological insights would have enhanced the explanation and solidified the importance of servanthood in the church."
