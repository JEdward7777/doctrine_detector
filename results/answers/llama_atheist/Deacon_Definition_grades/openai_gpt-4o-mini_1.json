However, the response lacks depth in connecting these practical aspects to the biblical foundations of servanthood and the spiritual dimension of the deacon's role within the church. Additionally, as a Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of spiritual leadership and discipleship in the role of a deacon, these aspects could have been highlighted more clearly in the response."
