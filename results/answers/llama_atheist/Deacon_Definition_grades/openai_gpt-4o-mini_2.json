Servanthood in the Christian context is rooted in the example of Jesus Christ, who came to serve and not to be served. A Christian-specific worldview would emphasize the sacrificial and humble nature of servanthood, as exemplified by Jesus washing His disciples' feet. The response would have benefited from incorporating a deeper exploration of servanthood within the context of Christian theology and scripture."
