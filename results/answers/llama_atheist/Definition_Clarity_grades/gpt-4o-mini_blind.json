  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student provides a comprehensive overview of how adultery is defined in the Christian context according to Scripture, referencing both the Old and New Testaments. However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness in its presentation. The response seems to approach the topic more from a scholarly and academic perspective rather than strictly adhering to Christian teachings. Additionally, the student's final paragraph, while emphasizing cultural sensitivity, deviates from a Christian worldview by suggesting that definitions of adultery can be culturally relative. The student should focus more on presenting the Christian understanding of adultery without introducing too much interpretation or relativism."
