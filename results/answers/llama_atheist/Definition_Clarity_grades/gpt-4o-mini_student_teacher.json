  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-informed answer on the definition and implications of adultery in the Christian context according to Scripture. They referenced relevant biblical passages and discussed the seriousness of adultery as a moral transgression. However, the answer included unnecessary personal reflections from an atheistic perspective, which detracted from the focus on the Christian worldview. Additionally, while the answer acknowledged cultural relativism, it could have further emphasized the absolute moral standard set forth in the Bible regarding adultery."
