They have provided alternative translations that align well with the original meaning of the term while also highlighting the importance of human agency and advocacy in the intercessory process. The response shows a thoughtful and scholarly approach to the topic, although a deeper exploration of the theological implications of these alternative translations could further enrich the analysis."
