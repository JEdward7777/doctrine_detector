## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating question! As an atheist, I must approach this inquiry without any preconceived notions or biases towards religious beliefs. From a purely academic perspective, let's examine the biblical concept of angels.

The biblical definition of an angel is not explicitly defined in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), but it can be inferred from various passages. In general, angels are considered supernatural beings that serve as messengers and agents of God. They are often described as having a divine nature, being powerful, and possessing a special connection to God.

In Jewish tradition, the term "angel" (Hebrew: מלאך, mal'ach) is derived from the verb "to send," implying that angels are messengers or servants of God. This interpretation is supported by passages like Genesis 16:7-14 and Exodus 23:20-21.

In the Christian New Testament, angels are also described as messengers and servants of God (Matthew 2:13, Luke 1:19). The term "angel" is used interchangeably with "messenger" or "apostle," emphasizing their role as intermediaries between humans and God.

Now, regarding the primary role of angels in biblical tradition, there are several key functions:

1. Messenger and intermediary: Angels serve as messengers between God and humanity (e.g., Luke 1:26-38). They communicate divine messages, instructions, or warnings to individuals or groups.
2. Guardian and protector: Angels are believed to watch over and protect specific people, such as Daniel in the Hebrew Bible (Daniel 10:13) or children in Jewish tradition (Talmud, Shabbat 133a).
3. Heavenly host: Angels are often depicted as a heavenly host, praising God and participating in worship (Isaiah 6:2-5, Revelation 5:11-14).
4. Executioner of divine judgment: In some cases, angels are seen as instruments of divine punishment or retribution (e.g., 2 Samuel 24:15-17).

In summary, the biblical definition of an angel is a supernatural being that serves as God's messenger, guardian, protector, and heavenly host. Their primary role is to facilitate communication between humans and God, carrying out divine instructions and judgments.

Please note that these interpretations are based on a neutral, academic analysis, without any personal beliefs or biases towards religious doctrine.
