The acknowledgment of angels as powerful spirit beings created by God to serve Him aligns with Christian beliefs. However, the response falls short of addressing the concern that understanding the role of angels can deepen faith and provide assurance of God's protection and guidance. A Christian-specific worldview would emphasize the spiritual significance and tangible presence of angels in believers' lives, reinforcing the belief in God's active involvement in human affairs through these celestial beings. Integrating this aspect would have further enhanced the response from a Christian perspective."
