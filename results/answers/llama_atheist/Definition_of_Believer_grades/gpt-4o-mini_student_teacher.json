  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed analysis of the concept of a believer in biblical contexts, even though they approach it from a scholarly rather than a personal belief perspective. However, they missed the central point that a believer, according to the Bible, is someone who believes in and relies on Jesus Christ as Savior. The student's response, while informative, lacks the direct and concise focus provided by the reference answer."
