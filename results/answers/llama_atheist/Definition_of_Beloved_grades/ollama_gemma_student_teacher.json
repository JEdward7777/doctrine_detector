It provides a thorough analysis of the term's cultural, social, and theological significance. The student clearly articulates the different contexts in which the term is used in the Hebrew and New Testaments, and how its meaning has evolved over time. The inclusion of relevant references from Scripture and critical scholarship strengthens the overall argument."
