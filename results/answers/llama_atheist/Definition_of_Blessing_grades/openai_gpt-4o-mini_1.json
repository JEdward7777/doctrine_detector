The acknowledgment of the significance of blessing in Christian practice and its roots in Jewish tradition is commendable. However, from a Christian perspective, the response could further emphasize the belief that blessings ultimately come from God and are not just wishful expressions for positive outcomes. Integrating this aspect would strengthen the response in addressing the concern more directly within a Christian worldview."
