The discussion accurately presents the evolution of the concept within early Christianity and highlights the community-oriented nature of the early church. However, the answer could be strengthened by integrating more explicitly Christian perspectives and doctrinal considerations, such as the role of Christ as the head of the church and the spiritual significance of the church as the body of believers. Emphasizing the theological aspects of the term \"church\" would enhance the overall analysis from a Christian worldview."
