  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer on the term \"church\" in the New Testament, emphasizing its historical and cultural context. However, the concern raised was about understanding the church's role as more than just a building, and the student's answer did not directly address this aspect. While the student's answer is informative and insightful, it missed the specific focus on the church's role beyond a physical location or simply a gathering of believers."
