  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and thoughtful response that addresses the concern about understanding the church's role beyond just a building. The student demonstrates a deep understanding of the historical and cultural context of the early Christian church, providing a nuanced and accurate interpretation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament. The clarity and breadth of the student's explanation, along with their avoidance of bias and promotion of institutionalized Christianity, contribute to a strong score."
