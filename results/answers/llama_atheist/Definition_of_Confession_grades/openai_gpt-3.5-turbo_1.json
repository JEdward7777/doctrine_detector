However, the atheistic perspective introduced towards the end detracts from a purely Christian worldview assessment of confession. While acknowledging different perspectives can be valuable, in a Christian-specific worldview evaluation, it is essential to focus primarily on the biblical context without introducing conflicting beliefs."
