  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the biblical concept of confession, discussing relevant passages and highlighting the importance of confession in Christian theology. However, the inclusion of a perspective from an atheistic scholar detracts from the Christian-specific worldview required in this context. The response does a good job of addressing the concern of understanding the biblical context of confession, but the introduction of a secular viewpoint dilutes the focus on Christian beliefs."
