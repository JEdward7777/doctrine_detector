  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provides a generally accurate explanation of the literal meaning of the term \"evangelist\" and its historical Christian context. However, as a Christian-specific worldview is being applied, points are deducted for the inclusion of the perspective of an atheist scholar and for downplaying the theological significance and distinctiveness of the term within Christianity. In a Christian grading context, the focus should be on the doctrinal understanding of evangelism within the faith tradition."
