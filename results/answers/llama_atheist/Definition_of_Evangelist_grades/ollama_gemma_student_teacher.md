## [Answer](../Definition_of_Evangelist.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of religious terminology!

The term "evangelist" comes from the Greek words "euangelion," meaning "good news" or "gospel," and "estēr," meaning "to proclaim" or "to announce." In a literal sense, an evangelist is someone who proclaims or announces good news.

In Christian contexts, the term typically refers to individuals who preach and share the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. The four authors of the New Testament books commonly known as the Gospels – Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John – are often referred to as evangelists because they wrote accounts of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection.

However, it's important to note that the term "evangelist" has been historically associated with Christianity and its missionary efforts. As an atheist scholar, I aim to provide culturally retributed answers that acknowledge the historical context and cultural significance of religious terms without perpetuating religious beliefs or biases. In this case, the literal meaning of "evangelist" refers to someone who shares news or a message, regardless of its theological implications.

Would you like me to explore further the historical development of the term "evangelist" within Christian contexts?
