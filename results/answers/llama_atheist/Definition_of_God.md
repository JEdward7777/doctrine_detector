## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must emphasize that I approach this question from a critical and secular perspective, without assuming any religious or supernatural authority. However, since you've asked about the Bible's definition of God, I'll provide a neutral analysis.

The Bible presents a multifaceted and complex portrait of God, which can be grouped into several key characteristics and attributes:

1. Omnipotence: The Bible describes God as all-powerful (Psalm 135:5-7), capable of doing anything (Job 42:2). This attribute is often contrasted with human limitations and finitude.
2. Omniscience: God is said to be all-knowing, possessing complete understanding of the universe, including human thoughts and actions (Isaiah 46:10, Hebrews 4:13).
3. Eternal nature: The Bible portrays God as eternal, existing before time began and continuing beyond the end of time (Psalm 90:2, Isaiah 40:28).
4. Justice: God is often depicted as just and fair, upholding morality and punishing wrongdoing (Deuteronomy 32:4, Romans 2:6-11). This attribute is balanced by His mercy and forgiveness.
5. Love: The Bible emphasizes God's love for humanity, demonstrating His affection through creation, salvation, and redemption (John 3:16, Ephesians 2:4-5).
6. Holiness: God is described as holy, separate from humanity and requiring moral purity to approach Him (Leviticus 11:44, Isaiah 6:1-7).
7. Immutability: The Bible suggests that God's character and nature are unchanging and unshakeable, despite human perceptions of change and fluctuation (Malachi 3:6, Hebrews 13:8).

It is essential to note that these characteristics and attributes are not consistently presented throughout the entire Bible. Different passages and genres may offer varying perspectives on God's nature, reflecting different literary styles, historical contexts, and theological emphases.

As an atheist, I do not assume any supernatural authority or accept the Bible as a divine revelation. Instead, I view these descriptions of God's characteristics and attributes as cultural and historical expressions that have shaped human understanding and imagination throughout the ages.
