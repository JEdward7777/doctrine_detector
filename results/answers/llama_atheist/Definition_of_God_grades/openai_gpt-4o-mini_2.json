However, it falls short in addressing the concern that understanding God's nature truthfully is essential for proper worship and relationship with Him. The emphasis on a purely cultural and historical interpretation disregards the significance of a Christian worldview that values the Bible as a divine revelation. The response lacks the recognition of God as a triune being and the importance of aligning one's understanding of God with biblical teachings for authentic worship and relationship."
