  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated analysis of the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil' from a cultural and historical perspective. However, the student's response overlooks the moral implications and the essence of good and evil as defined in the Bible. From a Christian worldview, 'good' is not merely a cultural construct but grounded in God's nature and character, and 'evil' is a departure from God's moral standard. The student's approach, while informative, lacks the Christian perspective on morality and the spiritual implications of good and evil in daily decision-making."
