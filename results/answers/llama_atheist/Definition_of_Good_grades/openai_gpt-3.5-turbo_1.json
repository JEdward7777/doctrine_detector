The emphasis on cultural and historical context, while important, overlooks the foundational Christian worldview that views \"good\" as morally right and \"evil\" as morally wrong. A Christian perspective would highlight the importance of aligning one's actions with God's moral standards and principles, rather than solely analyzing these concepts as culturally relative constructs."
