However, it missed the opportunity to delve deeper into the theological significance of the term from a Christian worldview. The student accurately highlighted the themes of divine distinctiveness, separation from the profane, exclusivity, and redemptive purpose associated with the term, but did not connect these themes to the core Christian belief in the holiness of God as revealed in the person of Jesus Christ. A more thorough exploration of how the concept of the \"Holy One\" in the Old Testament foreshadows the person and work of Christ would have enhanced the theological depth of the response."
