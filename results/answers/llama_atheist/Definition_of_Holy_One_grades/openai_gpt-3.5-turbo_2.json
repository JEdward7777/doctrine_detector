The perspective presented, although from a neutral and atheistic standpoint, effectively acknowledges the significance of God's holiness throughout Scripture. The understanding and analysis of God's unique role and holiness in the Bible are well-developed and insightful. However, from a Christian worldview, a more explicit acknowledgment of the significance of Jesus as the embodiment of the Holy One in the New Testament could have strengthened the response."
