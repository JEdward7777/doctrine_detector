However, it falls short of adequately addressing the concern of understanding the design and function of God's dwelling place from a Christian perspective. The response does not engage directly with the idea of the holy place as a space for God's presence or address the theological significance of God's dwelling among His people. More explicit connection to the Christian worldview and scriptural understanding of the holy place would enhance the response."
