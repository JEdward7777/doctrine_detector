## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I approach the concept of "saints" in the New Testament with a critical eye, seeking to understand its cultural and historical context.

In the ancient Mediterranean world, including the Jewish and early Christian communities, the term "holy ones" or "saints" (Greek: hagioi) referred to people who were considered morally pure, pious, and devoted to God. This understanding is rooted in the Hebrew Bible, where the term "kadosh" (Hebrew: קָדוֹשׁ) described those who were set apart for God's purposes.

In the New Testament, the term "saints" typically refers to believers in Jesus Christ who have been justified by faith and are now considered part of God's new community. This group includes both Jewish and Gentile (non-Jewish) Christians. In this sense, being a "saint" means being recognized as one who has been sanctified or set apart for God through faith in Jesus Christ.

The New Testament uses the term "saints" to describe various groups of believers, such as:

1. The earliest Christian communities (e.g., Acts 9:13; Romans 1:7).
2. Believers in general (e.g., Ephesians 1:1; Philippians 4:21).
3. Specific individuals or leaders within these communities (e.g., Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, in 1 Corinthians 1:2).

It's essential to note that this concept of "saints" is not equivalent to the medieval Roman Catholic understanding of saints as intercessors between God and humanity. Instead, it reflects a more ancient Mediterranean perspective, where moral purity and devotion to God were key characteristics.

In conclusion, when we encounter the term "saints" in the New Testament, we should recognize that it refers to believers who have been justified by faith and are now part of God's new community, characterized by moral purity, devotion to God, and a shared identity as followers of Jesus Christ.

Comment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of the term "saints" in the New Testament by delving into its cultural and historical context. The response correctly emphasizes the idea of believers being set apart for God through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the explanation could be enhanced by incorporating more specifically Christian doctrinal elements, such as the role of saints in the communion of the saints and their connection to Christ's work of redemption. Additionally, the comparison with the medieval Roman Catholic understanding could be clarified further for doctrinal accuracy.
