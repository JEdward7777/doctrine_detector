## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that has puzzled many a theologian and layperson alike! As an atheist, I'll approach this concept from a purely historical and cultural perspective, without injecting any supernatural or theological assumptions.

In the biblical context, "sanctify" (Hebrew: קדשׁ, pronounced kadesh) and "holy" (Hebrew: קדושׁ, pronounced qadosh) are related concepts that convey a sense of separation, consecration, and setting apart. These ideas were central to ancient Israelite culture and worship.

To sanctify something or someone means to set it apart for a specific purpose or function. In the case of God's sanctuary (the Temple), the priests and Levites would perform rituals to "sanctify" the space, making it fit for divine presence. Similarly, in everyday life, people might sanctify their homes by purifying them with sacrifices or rituals before major events like feasts or celebrations.

Being sanctified means being set apart for a specific purpose or role. In biblical language, someone can be "sanctified" to serve God (1 Corinthians 7:14), indicating that they have been consecrated for this purpose and are now dedicated to following God's ways. This sense of separation is not meant to imply moral superiority but rather a commitment to living in accordance with divine standards.

In the biblical narratives, people can be sanctified through rituals, sacrifices, or even prophetic pronouncements (e.g., Leviticus 20:8). For instance, when Moses and Aaron were consecrated as leaders, they underwent a ritualistic process to set them apart for their roles (Leviticus 8:1-36).

It's essential to note that this concept of sanctification was deeply rooted in the cultural and religious practices of ancient Israel. The idea was not unique to the Hebrew Bible but shared similarities with other ancient Near Eastern cultures, such as the Egyptians and Babylonians.

In summary, to sanctify or be sanctified in biblical terms means to set something or someone apart for a specific purpose, often through rituals, sacrifices, or prophetic pronouncements. This concept reflects the cultural and religious practices of ancient Israel, where the sacred and profane were intertwined, and the idea of separation was crucial for understanding one's place within the divine-human relationship.
