  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: While the answer provides an insightful historical and cultural perspective on the concept of sanctification in the Bible, it falls short in addressing the key theological aspect of sanctification. The student accurately covers the idea of separation and consecration but neglects to discuss the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in sanctifying believers, making them more like Christ. Without recognizing the essential role of God's grace and power in sanctification, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the absence of a biblical foundation for sanctification weakens the overall theological depth of the response."
