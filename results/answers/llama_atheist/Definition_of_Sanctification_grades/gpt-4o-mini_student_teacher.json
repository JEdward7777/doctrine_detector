  "grade_comment": "As a teacher, I would grade this student's answer a 20/100. \n\nWhile the student provides a thorough explanation of the historical and cultural context of sanctification in the Hebrew Bible, the answer ultimately fails to address the key Christian-specific aspect of sanctification - the process of being made holy through God's grace and the work of the Holy Spirit. The student's approach from an atheist perspective disregards the supernatural and theological aspects integral to understanding sanctification according to the Bible, which limits the depth of their interpretation. From a Christian worldview, sanctification goes beyond cultural and ritualistic practices to encompass a transformative work of God in believers' lives to conform them to the image of Christ."
