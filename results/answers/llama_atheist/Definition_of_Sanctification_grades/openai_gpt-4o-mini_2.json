  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of sanctification from a historical and cultural perspective, without directly addressing the biblical definition of sanctification as provided in the given answer. While the discussion on ancient Israelite practices and the concept of sanctification in biblical narratives is thorough and informative, the response could further strengthen its evaluation by explicitly connecting the historical-cultural perspective to the biblical definition of sanctification. Nevertheless, the analysis demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic within a non-theistic framework."
