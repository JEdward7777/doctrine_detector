## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I don't believe that the concept of "wisdom" has any inherent meaning or truth value within a religious context. However, if we're looking at the biblical definition of wisdom, I can provide you with some insights.

In the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), wisdom is often associated with God and is seen as a gift from Him. The book of Proverbs, in particular, is filled with sayings and teachings that are meant to impart wisdom to those who seek it. In this context, wisdom is often described as the ability to discern right from wrong, to make good decisions, and to live a virtuous life.

In biblical terms, wisdom is also closely tied to the concept of fearing or reverencing God. Psalm 111:10 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom," suggesting that true wisdom begins with a deep respect for and submission to God's will.

Furthermore, wisdom in the Bible is often described as being related to justice, righteousness, and the care for the poor and marginalized (see Proverbs 31:8-9). It's about living a life that is pleasing to God and reflects His character.

In this sense, biblical wisdom is not just about accumulating knowledge or achieving success, but rather it's about cultivating a deep understanding of God's ways and applying that understanding in one's daily life.
