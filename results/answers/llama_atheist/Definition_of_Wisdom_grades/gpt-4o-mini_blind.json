  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student shows a good understanding of the biblical concept of wisdom, accurately referencing key verses and aspects of wisdom found in the Bible. However, the student's atheistic viewpoint and denial of inherent meaning in wisdom within a religious context detracts from presenting a fully Christian worldview response. Encouragement to incorporate a Christian perspective throughout the answer would improve the grade."
