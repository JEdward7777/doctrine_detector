  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate overview of the biblical concept of wisdom, demonstrating an understanding of its association with God, discerning right from wrong, reverencing God, justice, righteousness, and care for the marginalized. However, the student's perspective as an atheist influences the tone of their response, leading to a lack of personal connection or conviction in their explanation of biblical wisdom. Furthermore, there could be a deeper exploration of the spiritual significance and transformative power of biblical wisdom that aligns more closely with the Christian worldview."
