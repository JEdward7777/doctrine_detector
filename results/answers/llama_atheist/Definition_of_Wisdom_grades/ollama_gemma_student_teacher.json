  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical definition of wisdom as encompassing moral understanding, decision-making, and living in accordance with God's will. The student correctly identifies relevant biblical passages and clearly articulates the connection between wisdom and fearing or reverencing God. However, as an atheist, the student's initial statement regarding the lack of inherent meaning or truth value in the concept of wisdom within a religious context is not entirely consistent with the Christian worldview being evaluated."
