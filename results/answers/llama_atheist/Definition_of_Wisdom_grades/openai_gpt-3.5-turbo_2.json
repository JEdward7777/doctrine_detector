  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thoughtful and comprehensive explanation of the biblical concept of wisdom, addressing key aspects such as the association of wisdom with God, the importance of fearing/reverencing God, the relationship between wisdom and justice/righteousness, and the responsibility to care for the poor and marginalized. The answer effectively highlights the significance of understanding biblical wisdom for aligning decisions with God's will. A slight deduction in points is made for not explicitly addressing how wisdom also involves practicing what is true and morally right as mentioned in the provided answer."
