However, the response lacks depth and fails to emphasize essential doctrinal truths that define a Christian according to a Christian worldview. Additionally, the language used suggests a secular perspective rather than a Christian one, and there is a missed opportunity to present a more robust biblical understanding of what it truly means to be a Christian in light of Christian theology."
