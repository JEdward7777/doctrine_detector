However, the perspective offered is from an atheistic viewpoint, which may not fully capture the true meaning of being a Christian in accordance with biblical teachings due to the lack of belief in the foundational tenets of Christianity. In order to fully understand the true meaning of being a Christian according to biblical teachings, one needs to approach the topic from a Christian worldview that affirms the divinity of Jesus Christ and the importance of faith in Him for salvation."
