  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: This response fundamentally strays from a Christian worldview in analyzing the concept of miracles. It dismisses the supernatural aspect of miracles and fails to acknowledge their significance in demonstrating God's authority. The perspective presented is heavily skewed towards atheistic beliefs, neglecting the core tenets of Christianity regarding miracles and divine intervention. A more doctrinally accurate understanding of miracles, rooted in faith and the power of God, is needed for a higher grade."
