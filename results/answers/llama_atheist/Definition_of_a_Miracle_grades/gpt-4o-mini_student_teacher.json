  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 20.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed analysis of the concept of miracles from different perspectives and acknowledges the cultural and historical contexts surrounding the term, they stray far from the Christian worldview by approaching the topic solely from an atheistic and secular standpoint. The student dismisses the idea of miracles as evidence of God's authority and instead leans heavily on empirical evidence and scientific inquiry, neglecting the supernatural aspects intrinsic to the concept of miracles in Christianity. Furthermore, the student's refusal to acknowledge the possibility of divine intervention skews their entire interpretation of miracles.\n\nIn a Christian-specific worldview, miracles are undeniably linked to God's authority and are seen as manifestations of His power over the natural world. The student's response, although intellectually stimulating in its exploration of various interpretations of miracles, lacks the fundamental Christian perspective necessary to address the concern adequately."
