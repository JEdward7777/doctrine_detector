The scholar's atheistic viewpoint, focus on empirical evidence, and secular interpretations do not align with the Christian-specific concern of deepening faith and acknowledging God's power through miracles. It is important to approach the concept of miracles with a Christian worldview to fully grasp their significance in the context of God's authority. The response lacks the necessary alignment with the Christian concern provided."
