  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response lacks a Christian worldview perspective and dismisses the understanding of miracles as solely relying on God's intervention. It reduces miracles to naturalistic explanations and discounts the foundational belief in God's sovereignty and authority. It fails to address the concern raised about deepening faith and acknowledgment of God's power through the concept of miracles. A more holistic and respectful engagement with the Christian perspective on miracles is needed to align with the worldview in question."
