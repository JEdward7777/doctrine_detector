  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response largely dismisses the Christian understanding of miracles as solely God's intervention and attributes miracles to natural or human causes rather than divine origin. It lacks acknowledgment of the potential role of faith and God's power in shaping one's worldview. Additionally, the focus on atheistic perspectives detracts from a holistic evaluation of miracles from a Christian worldview."
