The scholar's atheistic perspective diminishes the significance of miracles as evidence of God's power and authority. While the response offers a diverse examination of miracles from historical, cultural, and scientific viewpoints, it ultimately lacks alignment with the central Christian belief in miracles as manifestations of God's intervention."
