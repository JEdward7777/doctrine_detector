## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets at the heart of some of the most complex and contested issues in biblical studies! As an atheist scholar, I must approach this topic with a healthy dose of skepticism and a commitment to understanding the cultural context.

In the Old Testament, the phrase "people of God" (Hebrew: בְּנֵי הָאֱלוֹהִים, beney ha-Elohim) is often used to describe the Israelites, particularly in their early history before the monarchy. At its core, this phrase is a declaration of God's election and sovereignty over a particular group of people.

In the book of Exodus, for example, Moses says to Pharaoh, "The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you... The Israelites are my children, and I am their God" (Exodus 3:15-16). This language emphasizes God's paternal relationship with the people, underscoring their status as a chosen nation.

But what did this "chosenness" mean in practical terms? For one, it meant that the Israelites were seen as being under God's direct protection and guidance. They were expected to obey God's laws and commandments, which were considered essential for maintaining their relationship with Yahweh.

In return for their obedience, the people of God could expect blessings, such as land, prosperity, and victory over their enemies (e.g., Deuteronomy 28:1-14). Conversely, disobedience would lead to curses, such as exile or defeat.

The concept of being one of the "people of God" also had implications for social hierarchy and identity. In Israelite society, membership in the people of God was often tied to ethnicity (being a descendant of Jacob) and family lineage (e.g., Leviticus 21:17-23). Those who were considered part of this group enjoyed certain privileges and responsibilities, such as participating in the Temple cult and observing the Sabbath.

Of course, this concept of being one of the "people of God" is not without its complexities. The Old Testament itself highlights tensions between different groups within Israel (e.g., the northern and southern kingdoms) and the inclusion or exclusion of certain individuals based on their behavior or lineage.

As an atheist scholar, I acknowledge that my interpretation may differ from that of religious scholars who bring their own theological perspectives to the text. Nonetheless, I believe it's essential to understand the cultural context in which these phrases were written and how they contributed to the development of Israelite identity and society.
