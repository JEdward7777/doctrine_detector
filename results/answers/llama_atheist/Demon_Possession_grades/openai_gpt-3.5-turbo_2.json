The information presented is thorough and well-researched. However, it lacks an examination of the Christian-specific worldview concerning the nature of spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ. While the response acknowledges ancient Near Eastern beliefs and Jewish and early Christian practices related to demon possession, it does not address the Christian perspective on how spiritual warfare is fought and the role of Jesus Christ in deliverance. Incorporating this aspect would have enhanced the analysis from a Christian worldview."
