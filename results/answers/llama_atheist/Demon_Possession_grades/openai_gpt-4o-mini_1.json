The response focuses solely on secular interpretations of demon possession without incorporating the importance of Jesus Christ in overcoming spiritual warfare and the need for deliverance. A Christian worldview would emphasize the power of Jesus Christ to cast out demons and provide spiritual deliverance for individuals."
