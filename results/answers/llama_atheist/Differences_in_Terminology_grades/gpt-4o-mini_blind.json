  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-written analysis of the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' from a neutral, academic perspective. However, as this grading is done with a Christian worldview, the answer lacks a critical element of understanding these terms in light of biblical teachings. It misses the essence of exhortation, encouragement, and admonition as understood within the moral framework of Christianity. The answer also disregards the spiritual implications and contexts in which these terms are often used in the Bible and Christian teachings. A stronger integration of Christian perspectives and references would significantly enhance the response."
