  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-articulated analysis of the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' from a secular perspective, considering their cultural and historical nuances. However, the student's response does not address the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of these terms according to scripture. The Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of using language and communication in alignment with biblical teachings and principles. The student's answer, although informative and insightful in a general context, lacks the essential aspect of evaluating these terms through a Christian lens."
