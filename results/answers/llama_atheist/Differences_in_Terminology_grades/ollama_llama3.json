  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response does attempt to clarify the nuances of each verb, including their connotations and historical contexts. It also provides relevant examples from various domains (environmental activism, sports coaching, medicine) to illustrate how these verbs can be used in different situations. The key differences between exhort, encourage, and admonish are also well-explained.\n\nHowever, the response falls short of fully addressing the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. While it does mention Jesus' exhortations in the New Testament, it does not specifically explore how these verbs relate to biblical principles or provide clear guidelines for Christian communication.\n\nFurthermore, the response's focus on cultural and historical contexts, while valuable, may detract from its ability to provide a distinctly Christian perspective on encouragement. A more explicit connection between the verbs' meanings and biblical teachings would be beneficial in addressing the concern.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to incorporate more explicitly Christian examples or reflections on how these verbs relate to biblical principles, such as the importance of encouraging others in their faith journeys (1 Thessalonians 3:2) or the need for admonition in the face of sin and temptation (Hebrews 12:5-6)."
