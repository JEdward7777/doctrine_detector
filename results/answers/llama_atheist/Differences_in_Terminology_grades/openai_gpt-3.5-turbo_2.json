  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a generally accurate and insightful analysis of the meanings and nuances of the terms \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" from a secular perspective. It draws on cultural and historical contexts to explain the distinctions between these verbs effectively. However, the response lacks a direct connection to Scripture or a Christian worldview when discussing the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement. While the analysis is thorough and well-structured, integrating Biblical references or principles into the explanation would further enhance the response from a Christian-specific perspective."
