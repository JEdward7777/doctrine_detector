While the explanation aligns with the Christian worldview in terms of the general meanings of the words, it lacks direct reference to scripture to clarify the appropriate use of these forms of encouragement according to biblical principles. Encouragement and admonishment from a Christian perspective are rooted in love, correction, and guidance based on God's Word, which could have been emphasized more in the response."
