The examples given help illustrate the differences in meaning and usage. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the response lacks scriptural references or insights on how these forms of encouragement align with biblical principles. Integrating relevant biblical teachings on encouragement and correction could further enhance the response to address the concern more directly."
