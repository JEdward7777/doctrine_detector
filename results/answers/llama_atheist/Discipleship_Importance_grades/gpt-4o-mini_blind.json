However, it fails to address the primary theological significance of the twelve apostles being chosen by Jesus, which is crucial from a Christian worldview. The response focuses more on cultural context rather than understanding this event through the lens of Jesus' divine purpose and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. In a Christian evaluation, it is essential to prioritize theological significance and the intentions of Jesus in forming the Twelve, rather than solely focusing on cultural and historical interpretations."
