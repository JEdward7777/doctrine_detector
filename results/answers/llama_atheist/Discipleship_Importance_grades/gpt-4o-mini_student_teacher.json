  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-researched and thoughtful analysis from a historical and cultural perspective, the answer lacked a Christian worldview perspective. The student failed to address the core theological significance of the apostles in the New Testament, which is crucial in understanding their role as chosen by Jesus. Incorporating insights from a Christian perspective would have strengthened the answer."
