They provide a nuanced and well-researched analysis of the possible reasons why Jesus chose his twelve disciples, drawing on relevant Jewish traditions and social dynamics. The student's atheism does not impede their ability to provide a thoughtful and insightful response from a Christian-specific worldview."
