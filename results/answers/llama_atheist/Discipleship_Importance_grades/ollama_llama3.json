  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe respondent provides a nuanced and culturally informed analysis of the significance of Jesus' choice of twelve apostles, drawing on historical and cultural context from ancient Judaism and the early Christian movement. They consider multiple possible reasons behind Jesus' selection, including Jewish traditions surrounding unity and wholeness, the role of witnesses to his teachings and miracles, and social dynamics of patronage networks.\n\nThe respondent's approach is particularly strong in its attention to the cultural and historical context, which helps to provide a richer understanding of the significance of the apostles. Their willingness to consider multiple possible reasons behind Jesus' choice rather than offering a single, definitive answer also demonstrates a thoughtful and humble approach to biblical interpretation.\n\nWhere the response falls short is in not explicitly addressing the concern about the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. While they do provide some insightful observations about the apostles' role as witnesses and their importance for establishing the early Church, the connection between these points and the concern could be more explicit.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a thoughtful and culturally informed analysis that helps to deepen our understanding of the significance of Jesus' choice of twelve apostles."
