While the explanation acknowledges the cultural and social dynamics at play, it lacks a Christian-specific worldview and fails to recognize the spiritual significance of the apostles in the New Testament. It would be beneficial to include a perspective that highlights the divine calling and purpose behind the selection of the apostles in relation to the establishment of the early Church."
