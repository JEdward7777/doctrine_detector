  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful exploration of the potential reasons behind Jesus' choice of twelve apostles, touching on factors such as Jewish traditions, the role of witnesses, and social dynamics. However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern by not explicitly acknowledging the significance of the apostles in the New Testament from a Christian worldview. The analysis remains largely focused on historical and cultural contexts rather than emphasizing the specific role and significance of the apostles within Christian theology."
