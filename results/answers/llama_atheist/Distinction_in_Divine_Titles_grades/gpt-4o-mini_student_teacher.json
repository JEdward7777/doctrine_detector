  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed analysis from a scholarly and linguistic perspective, their answer does not directly address the concern of maintaining clarity in translations to prevent misinterpretations concerning God's identity and authority. The student's focus on linguistic accuracy and cultural significance is valuable, but the lack of emphasis on potential confusion for readers regarding the distinct meanings behind capitalization detracts from the overall alignment with the specified concern. Further integration of the concern provided by the teacher would improve the grade."
