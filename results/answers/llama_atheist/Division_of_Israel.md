## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
After the reign of King Solomon, a significant event in Israel's history was the division of the kingdom into two parts: the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel.

According to biblical accounts, this division occurred during the reign of King Rehoboam, who succeeded King Solomon. Rehoboam was the son of King Solomon and was known for his stubbornness and refusal to listen to his people's demands (1 Kings 12:1-24).

The northern tribes, led by Jeroboam, rebelled against the rule of King Rehoboam and formed their own kingdom, which became known as the Kingdom of Israel. This event is recorded in 1 Kings 12:16-20.

This division had significant consequences for both kingdoms. The Kingdom of Judah, which included Jerusalem and the southern tribes, remained a relatively small but prosperous state, while the Kingdom of Israel, also known as Samaria, became a larger but more turbulent kingdom.

The division of the kingdom was a major turning point in Israel's history, marking the beginning of a period of gradual decline and eventual exile for both kingdoms.
