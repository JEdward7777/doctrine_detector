  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the division of the kingdom of Israel after King Solomon's reign. They referenced biblical accounts and explained the consequences of the division for both the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel. The only area for improvement would be to directly state that the division resulted in the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah, as mentioned in the reference answer."
