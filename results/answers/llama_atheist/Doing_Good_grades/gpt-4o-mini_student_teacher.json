  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful answer from a secular perspective, exploring the cultural, historical, and ethical implications of \"doing good to\" within a Christian context. However, the answer lacked a direct Christian worldview perspective and failed to emphasize the central role of reflecting Christ's love in the act of doing good to others. It would have been beneficial for the student to focus more explicitly on the theological significance of this concept within Christianity."
