  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 90.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of encouraging Christians to live out their faith by doing good deeds. The writer provides a clear definition of what \"do good to\" means in a Christian context, citing relevant biblical passages and emphasizing the importance of compassion and kindness. The discussion of historical context and the influence of Christian teachings on Western philanthropy and social service movements is also well-done.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could benefit from more specific examples or applications of what \"do good to\" looks like in everyday life. While the writer provides some general categories (almsgiving, mercy, acts of service), they could have been more concrete about how these concepts play out in different situations and contexts.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept \"do good to\" in a Christian context."
