However, while the response acknowledges the significance of this concept in Christian ethics and history, it falls short in explicitly encouraging Christians to live out their faith by engaging in good deeds. A stronger emphasis on motivating and inspiring Christians to put their faith into action through acts of kindness and service would have enhanced the Christian worldview perspective in this context."
