The focus on stewardship rather than exploitation aligns well with the biblical principle of caring for creation. However, the answer could be improved by including more direct references to key biblical passages and theological teachings on dominion. Additionally, highlighting the importance of redemption and restoration through Christ in the context of our relationship with creation would have enhanced the theological depth of the response."
