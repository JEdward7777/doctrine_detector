The understanding of dominion in its cultural context and the emphasis on responsibility rather than exploitation align well with a Christian worldview. The integration of relevant biblical passages and the connection between human and natural worlds demonstrates a holistic approach to the topic. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding our God-given authority over creation and how to exercise it responsibly. Great job!"
