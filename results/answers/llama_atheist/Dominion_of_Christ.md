## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I'll provide an answer that's based on biblical accounts and avoids any religious or theological interpretations.

In the Bible, Jesus Christ's dominion is described as being of two types: his kingdom on earth and his reign in heaven. Here are some key descriptions:

1. Earthly Kingdom: In Matthew 4:23 and Mark 9:38-39, it's said that Jesus preached the kingdom of God (or heaven) and performed miracles, demonstrating his authority. His earthly ministry was a manifestation of the kingdom he came to establish.
2. Heavenly Reign: In Revelation 1:5, John describes Jesus as "the ruler of kings on earth" (NIV), emphasizing his sovereignty over earthly kingdoms. Similarly, in Revelation 12:10-11 and Philippians 2:9-11, Jesus is portrayed as having been exalted to the right hand of God the Father, where he reigns supreme.
3. Spiritual Dominion: Throughout the Bible, especially in the Gospels and Epistles, Jesus' dominion is described as a spiritual one. He's seen as the Son of God, sent to establish a new covenant (Luke 22:20) and to bring salvation through his life, death, and resurrection (John 3:16-17).
4. Cosmic Ruler: In Colossians 1:15-20 and Hebrews 1:2-3, Jesus is described as the one who created the universe and sustains it through his divine power. This emphasizes his position as the supreme ruler of all creation.

When examining these biblical accounts, I avoid making theological or religious claims about Jesus' dominion. Instead, I focus on understanding the cultural and historical context in which these descriptions were written, and how they might have been perceived by the original audience.
