However, it falls short in the aspect of theological depth. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to acknowledge and explore the theological implications of Jesus' dominion beyond merely presenting historical and cultural contexts. Incorporating the significance of Jesus' dominion in terms of salvation, redemption, and His role as the Son of God would have enriched the response. Additionally, failing to address the ultimate authority of Jesus as described in passages such as Matthew 28:18 weakens the completeness of the answer."
