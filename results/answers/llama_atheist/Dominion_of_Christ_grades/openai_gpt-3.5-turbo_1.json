However, the concern about recognizing the authority of Christ in all aspects of life and its impact on our faith is not directly addressed. The response could have delved deeper into the practical implications of Christ's dominion in shaping our beliefs and actions, applying the theological truth to everyday life more explicitly from a Christian worldview."
