However, the response could be enhanced by explicitly connecting the authority of Christ to the impact on one's faith and daily life, aligning more closely with the concern provided. Additionally, while the explanation avoids theological claims, it could benefit from a clearer integration of how recognizing Christ's authority influences believers' actions, beliefs, and relationship with Him in all aspects of life."
