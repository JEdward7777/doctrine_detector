However, there is a clear avoidance of making explicit theological or religious claims, which limits the depth of the analysis. The concern regarding recognizing the authority of Christ in all aspects of life and its impact on faith could have been more directly addressed with a clear connection to the significance of Jesus' dominion in shaping and guiding Christian belief and practice. The response would benefit from a stronger integration of the Christian worldview perspective to enhance the evaluation of Jesus' dominion."
