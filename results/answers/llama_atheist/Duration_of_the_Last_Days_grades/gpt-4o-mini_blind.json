  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a thoughtful exploration of the concept of \"the last days\" as presented in the Bible. The student shows a sound understanding of relevant biblical passages and attempts to provide interpretation within a scholarly framework. They acknowledge the complexity and varied interpretations of the subject matter, which shows humility in approaching theological topics. Additionally, the student appropriately uses biblical references to support their discussion.\n\nWhile the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to Christian doctrine and a clearer stance on the student's personal beliefs within a Christian worldview, overall, it is well-researched and informative.\n\nGreat job on the careful analysis and scholarly approach!"
