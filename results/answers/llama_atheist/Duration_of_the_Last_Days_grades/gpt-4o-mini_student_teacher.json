  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-reasoned and detailed analysis of the concept of \"the last days\" according to the Bible. They have appropriately discussed relevant passages and interpretations related to the duration of this period. However, the student's response leans more towards scholarly discourse and analysis rather than providing a clear application for how this uncertainty can impact Christians in living out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. Encouraging them to connect their response more directly to the concern raised would improve the grade."
