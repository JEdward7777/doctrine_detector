  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical texts and a nuanced approach to the question. The student provides a thorough analysis of the relevant passages, highlighting the ambiguity and lack of definitive information regarding the duration of \"the last days.\" The inclusion of references to historical context and theological debates adds depth to the response."
