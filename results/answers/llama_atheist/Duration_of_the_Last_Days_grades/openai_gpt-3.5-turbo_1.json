  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned and informed analysis of the concept of \"the last days\" in the Bible, acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding its duration. The author appropriately discusses relevant passages and interpretations while emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and careful exegesis. However, the concern raised about how this uncertainty can impact Christian faith in anticipation of Christ's return is somewhat glossed over. More direct discussion on how Christians navigate living out their faith in light of this uncertainty would have strengthened the response."
