The mention of key biblical passages and interpretations adds depth to the analysis. However, while the response approaches the topic with critical thinking and scholarly rigor, it could further address the concern raised about how this uncertainty impacts Christian living in anticipation of Christ's return. Emphasizing the importance of faith, hope, and perseverance in the face of uncertainty would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
