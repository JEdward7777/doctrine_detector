  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 40. While the student provided a thoughtful analysis of Gideon's actions in a historical and cultural context, they missed addressing the concern about the importance of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith. The student's response focused more on the blending of sacred and secular authority without directly tying it back to the lesson of avoiding idolatry. By not directly addressing the specified concern, the student's answer lacks alignment with a Christian worldview perspective."
