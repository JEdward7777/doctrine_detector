  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of Gideon's creation of the gold ephod and its implications in terms of maintaining boundaries between sacred and secular authority. The response effectively ties in contemporary issues like the separation of church and state and critical thinking skills. However, the grading is lower as the response does not emphasize the central theme of how objects associated with worship can become idols and lead people away from true worship of God. This aspect should have been given more prominence in the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
