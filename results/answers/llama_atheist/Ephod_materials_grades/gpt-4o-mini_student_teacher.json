  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate historical and cultural analysis of the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod. While the response lacked a direct Christian worldview perspective, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the significance of the materials in the context of ancient Hebrew culture and worship practices. The answer effectively addressed the concern by highlighting the importance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship, even though it did not explicitly discuss divine or mystical properties."
