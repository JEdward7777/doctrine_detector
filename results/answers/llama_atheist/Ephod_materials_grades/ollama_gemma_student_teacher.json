  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and well-written response that addresses both the historical and cultural significance of the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical text and relevant historical information, and their atheist perspective adds an additional layer of analysis. While the response does not explicitly address the concern about symbolism in worship, it implicitly acknowledges the importance of symbolism through the use of expensive and exotic materials."
