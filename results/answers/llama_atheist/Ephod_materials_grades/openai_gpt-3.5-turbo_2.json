The scholar demonstrates a sound understanding of the significance of these materials in ancient Hebrew culture. However, the response falls short by not addressing the potential divine or mystical significance of the ephod, as indicated in the concern. From a Christian worldview, it is essential to acknowledge the spiritual and symbolic significance of the high priest's ephod in the context of worship and the priestly role in connecting with God."
