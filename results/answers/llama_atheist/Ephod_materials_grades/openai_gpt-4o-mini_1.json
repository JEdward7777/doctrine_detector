However, as a Christian worldview emphasizes the divine significance and symbolism in religious artifacts, the response falls short in acknowledging or exploring the spiritual symbolism associated with the high priest's ephod within the context of Hebrew biblical beliefs. An understanding of the ephod's role as part of the priestly attire and its symbolic representation of the priest's authority and intercessory role between God and the people would enhance the response from a Christian perspective."
