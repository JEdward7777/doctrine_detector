The scholar effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship. However, the response falls short of acknowledging the potential spiritual or theological implications of these materials from a Christian worldview, given the ephod's role in the Israelite religious practices and the symbolism tied to the high priest's intercessory role. Integrating insights from a Christian perspective would have enriched the analysis further."
