As a scholar, I'd like to approach this question from a neutral and evidence-based perspective.

In the Hebrew Bible, the ephod was a type of garment worn by the high priest (Hebrew: kohen gadol) when conducting rituals and sacrifices in the Temple. The significance of the ephod can be understood through its biblical descriptions and archaeological findings.

According to Exodus 28:4-5, the high priest's ephod was made of intricately woven fabric, with gold thread and precious stones. It had a pouch on the front where sacred objects were stored (Exodus 28:29-30). The ephod was designed to symbolize the connection between God and humanity.

Several aspects make the ephod significant in Old Testament worship:

1. **Divine authority**: Wearing the ephod signified the high priest's divine commission, underscoring their role as a mediator between God and the people (Exodus 28:3).
2. **Ritual attire**: The ephod was part of the high priest's official vestments, emphasizing his status as a representative of God in religious ceremonies.
3. **God's presence**: The ephod contained sacred objects like the Urim and Thummim (Exodus 28:30), which were believed to possess divine guidance (Numbers 27:21). This association with God's presence highlights the importance of the high priest's role.
4. **Symbolism of human connection**: Archaeological findings suggest that the ephod's design may have been influenced by Mesopotamian and Egyptian textile traditions, symbolizing the connection between God and humanity.

It is essential to note that the significance of the ephod can be understood within its biblical context without resorting to modern-day theological or cultural interpretations.
