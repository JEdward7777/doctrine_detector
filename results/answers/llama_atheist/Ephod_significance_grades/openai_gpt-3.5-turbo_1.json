It effectively highlights the ephod's role in mediating between God and the people, as well as its connection to discerning God's will through the Urim and Thummim. The clear and detailed analysis from both a biblical and archaeological perspective enhances the understanding of the ephod within the context of Old Testament priesthood and worship practices. The response could have strengthened its Christian worldview perspective by emphasizing the unique role of the high priest in representing Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity."
