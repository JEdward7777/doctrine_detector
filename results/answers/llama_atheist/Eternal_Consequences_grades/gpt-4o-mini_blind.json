  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComments: The response strays far from a Christian worldview and does not address the eternal consequences for those described as \"perishing\" in alignment with Christian doctrine. The emphasis on reason, empirical observation, and dismissal of supernatural explanations conflicts with core Christian beliefs in the afterlife, resurrection, and judgment. The lack of acknowledgment or discussion of biblical teachings on the topic results in a very low grade from a Christian perspective."
