  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the Christian worldview and the importance of understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God. The response denies the existence of an afterlife and does not address the consequences of perishing from a Christian perspective. It lacks a foundational understanding of the Christian belief in the eternal consequences of sin and rejection of God."
