## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a non-theist, I'll approach this question from a philosophical perspective, focusing on the cultural and historical context in which the concept of the "Son of God" emerged.

In ancient Mediterranean cultures, including Jewish and Christian traditions, the notion of a divine son or messiah was often associated with savior figures who would bring redemption to humanity. The "Son of God" is typically seen as a unique being with attributes that set him apart from human sons.

Existence:

* Human sons: Are born of mortal parents and are subject to the limitations and fragilities of human existence.
* The "Son of God": In Christian theology, Jesus Christ is considered the only-begotten Son of God, begotten by the Father and co-eternal with Him. This implies that the Son of God has a divine origin, separate from human birth.

Eternal Nature:

* Human sons: Are mortal and their existence is bound to time. They have a beginning and an end.
* The "Son of God": In Christian theology, Jesus Christ is believed to be eternal in the sense that He shares the same eternal nature as the Father. This means that His existence is not limited by time or mortality.

Other differences between human sons and the Son of God might include:

1. Nature: Human sons are born with a natural, mortal body, while the Son of God is often depicted as having a divine, immortal body.
2. Authority: As the "Son of God," Jesus Christ is often seen as possessing divine authority, whereas human sons have no inherent authority or power beyond their mortal limitations.
3. Purpose: Human sons are born to fulfill specific roles in life, while the Son of God is believed to be sent by the Father with a divine mission to redeem humanity.

It's essential to note that these distinctions are rooted in Christian theology and may vary across different cultural and religious contexts. As an atheist scholar, I'm not attempting to establish or justify the existence or nature of the Son of God but rather provide a nuanced understanding of the concept within its historical and cultural framework.
