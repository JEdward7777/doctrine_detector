However, it falls short in addressing the core doctrinal beliefs of Christianity regarding the nature of the \"Son of God\" as understood within Christian theology. It lacks the acknowledgement of the biblical basis and the divinity of Jesus Christ, particularly in terms of His role in the doctrine of the Trinity. The focus on cultural context is informative but does not fully delve into the foundational beliefs that distinguish the Christian understanding of the \"Son of God\" from human sons."
