  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer provides a thoughtful and well-researched analysis of the differences between the Son of God and human sons from a philosophical and historical perspective. It acknowledges the cultural and religious contexts in which the concept of the Son of God emerged and highlights the theological beliefs surrounding his eternal nature. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific biblical references or Christian doctrines that support the claim that the Son of God has always existed and was active in the creation of the world."
