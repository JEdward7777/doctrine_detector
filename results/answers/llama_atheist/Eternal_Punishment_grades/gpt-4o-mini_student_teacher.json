  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provides a well-structured and thoughtful analysis of the concept of eternal punishment in hell, considering both theological perspectives and critical viewpoints. However, the response lacks a clear assertion of the Christian worldview on the issue of divine justice and eternal consequences. The student's exploration of differing perspectives is insightful but falls short in explicitly connecting the concept of eternal punishment in hell to God's justice as understood in Christianity. A stronger emphasis on aligning the analysis with the Christian perspective would have improved the grade in this context."
