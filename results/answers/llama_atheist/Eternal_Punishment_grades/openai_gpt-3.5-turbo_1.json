It acknowledges the tension between divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences, raising valid concerns about the fairness of eternal punishment. While the response integrates various viewpoints effectively, it could have delved deeper into exploring how divine justice and mercy intersect in the context of eternal consequences. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to emphasize the foundational Christian belief that God's justice is ultimately balanced with His mercy and love."
