  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-rounded analysis of the concept of eternal punishment in hell, acknowledging both theological perspectives and critical concerns. It effectively explores how the notion of eternal punishment can be viewed as reflecting both God's justice and mercy, considering the importance of repentance and the consequences of rejecting salvation. The critique of the punitive and retributive aspects of eternal punishment demonstrates an awareness of the complexities surrounding the nature of divine justice and mercy. Overall, the response engages with the specified concern effectively and offers insightful reflections, though could have delved deeper into how a Christian worldview specifically addresses these issues."
