It effectively addresses the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences by presenting various interpretations and viewpoints. However, the response could have delved deeper into the Christian perspective on God's justice and mercy specifically, and how they intersect with the concept of eternal punishment in hell according to Christian teachings."
