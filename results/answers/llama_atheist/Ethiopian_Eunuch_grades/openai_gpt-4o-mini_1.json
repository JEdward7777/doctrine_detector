It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the inclusiveness of the Christian message and the role of individuals from diverse backgrounds in the early church. The theological reflections and implications drawn from the biblical narrative demonstrate a solid understanding of the Christian worldview and its emphasis on the universal acceptance of believers regardless of background. The response effectively incorporates key Christian principles and perspectives into the evaluation of the given answer. Great job!"
