However, the answer falls short by failing to acknowledge the theological significance of Jesus' words. From a Christian perspective, Jesus' reference to eunuchs does indeed have implications for the concept of celibacy, particularly in relation to dedicating oneself fully to God's Kingdom. The response could be strengthened by incorporating the theological aspect of celibacy as it relates to discipleship and the call to follow Christ wholeheartedly."
