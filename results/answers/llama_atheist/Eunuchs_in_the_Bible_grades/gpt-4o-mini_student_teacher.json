  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed cultural-historical analysis of eunuchs in ancient Jewish culture and their relevance to the context of Matthew 19:12, their answer lacked a Christian-specific worldview. The student did not engage with the biblical perspective on celibacy and missed the key connection between eunuchs and celibacy for the sake of the kingdom of heaven as taught by Jesus. A stronger emphasis on the theological implications of Jesus' statement in Matthew 19:12 and its relation to celibacy from a Christian worldview would have improved the answer."
