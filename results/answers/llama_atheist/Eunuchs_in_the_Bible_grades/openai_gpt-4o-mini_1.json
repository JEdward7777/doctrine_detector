However, the response lacks a clear integration of the biblical perspective on celibacy and how it relates to the different reasons for living a life without marriage. It would have been beneficial to directly address the biblical teachings on celibacy and the significance of choosing celibacy for the kingdom of heaven based on scriptural references."
