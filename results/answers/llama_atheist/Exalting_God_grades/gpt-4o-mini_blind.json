  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: The response provided by the student demonstrates an attempt to engage with the concept of \"exalting God\" from a secular perspective, acknowledging cultural relativism and rejecting supernatural claims. While the student makes an effort to provide an alternative viewpoint on the idea of exaltation by emphasizing honoring values and principles in daily life, the response lacks acknowledgment of the Christian perspective on exalting God. From a Christian worldview, exalting God entails recognizing and honoring the sovereignty, holiness, and authority of God as the Creator and sustainer of all things. The student's response falls short in addressing this fundamental aspect, thus not aligning well with a Christian-specific worldview."
