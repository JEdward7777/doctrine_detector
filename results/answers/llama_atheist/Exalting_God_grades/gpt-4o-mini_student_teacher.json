  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response fails to directly address the concept of exalting God as outlined in a Christian worldview. While they provide a thoughtful exploration of alternative perspectives on exalting values and aspects of human experience, they do not engage with the importance of exalting God above all else. In a Christian context, exalting God entails acknowledging Him as the ultimate authority and source of goodness in a believer's life. The student's focus on secular values and cultural relativism strays far from the Christian-specific understanding of exalting God."
