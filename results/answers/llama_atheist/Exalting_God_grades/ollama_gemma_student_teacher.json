  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of exalting God from a Christian perspective. They acknowledge the traditional religious understanding of exaltation while also offering a broader, secular interpretation that aligns with their cultural relativist approach. The student's arguments regarding honoring nature, human connection, cultural heritage, and knowledge are well-articulated and demonstrate a deep appreciation for the values that bring meaning to life. However, the answer could benefit from explicitly connecting these concepts to Christian beliefs and practices."
