  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response offers an alternative perspective on the concept of exalting something in daily life, it falls short in addressing the importance of exalting God above all else. From a Christian worldview, exalting God is central to understanding one's purpose and relationship with the Creator. The response lacks acknowledgment of God as the ultimate source of goodness, justice, and meaning in life, and does not emphasize the significance of living according to His will. Therefore, the grade is lower as it does not prioritize the importance of exalting God above all else in life."
