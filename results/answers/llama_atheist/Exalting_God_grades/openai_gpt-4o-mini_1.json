  "grade_comment": "Grade: 15\n\nComment: The response provided fails to address the importance of exalting God above all else in life from a Christian worldview perspective. While the alternative perspective on exalting aspects of human experience is interesting, it does not align with the specific concern regarding the significance of exalting God. This response lacks a Christian-specific understanding of the importance of honoring God through worship, prayer, and obedience to His will."
