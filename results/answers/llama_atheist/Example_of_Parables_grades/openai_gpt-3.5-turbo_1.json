  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the moral lessons embedded in the Parable of the Good Samaritan by delving into its cultural context, Jesus' critique of religious hypocrisy, and the broader implications for social justice. The analysis demonstrates a clear understanding of the relevance of this parable today from a moral and ethical standpoint, despite the author's atheistic perspective. The only area for improvement would be to acknowledge the theological implications of the parable within a Christian worldview."
