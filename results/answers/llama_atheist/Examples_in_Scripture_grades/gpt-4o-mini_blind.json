  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While the student did provide examples from the Bible that illustrate instances of demon possession, the analysis lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview. The student's approach leans heavily on a secular and historical perspective, failing to acknowledge the spiritual reality of demonic possession as understood within Christianity. The student should have emphasized the authority of Jesus over demons and the significance of these instances in highlighting Jesus' power and mission. Further, the student did not incorporate scriptural references to support their claims, and their analysis downplays the supernatural aspects of these accounts. Additional focus on the theological implications of demon possession in the Bible would have strengthened the response."
