  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: While the student provided detailed examples from the Bible illustrating instances of demon possession and discussed the cultural and historical context surrounding these accounts, they missed the mark on the concern of understanding the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith. The response focused more on historical interpretations and societal views of demon possession rather than connecting these narratives to the spiritual realities and lessons they convey for modern believers. Additionally, the student could have integrated the reference answer provided by the teacher to further strengthen their response."
