  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical narratives related to demon possession and their cultural context. They provide detailed examples from the Gospels, analyzing the different perspectives and explanations of these events. The student also acknowledges the influence of ancient cultural beliefs and encourages critical engagement with the texts. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview and its interpretation of demonic possession."
