However, the response could further emphasize the spiritual significance of these narratives in shaping contemporary faith beliefs and practices. Encouraging a deeper exploration of the implications of these spiritual issues for modern believers would enhance the overall depth and relevance of the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
