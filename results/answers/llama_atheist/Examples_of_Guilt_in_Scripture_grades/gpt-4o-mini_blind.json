However, the perspective of neutrality and avoidance of religious implications hinder the depth of analysis that could have been offered from a Christian worldview. The response could have been greatly strengthened by delving into the theological significance of guilt, repentance, and forgiveness within the framework of Christian doctrine. Additionally, avoiding value judgments or acknowledging the moral implications of guilt from a biblical standpoint limits the answer's effectiveness in addressing the topic comprehensively."
