  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured response with relevant examples from the Bible demonstrating the concept of guilt. However, the answer did not directly address the concern provided, which emphasized the need for divine judgment in understanding guilt. The examples provided by the student, while insightful, did not specifically tie back to divine judgment as requested in the concern. Additionally, the student explicitly stated they were approaching the topic from a neutral, scholarly perspective, which does not align with the Christian worldview that recognizes the importance of divine judgment in understanding guilt. A stronger connection to divine judgment and innocence in the examples discussed would have improved the grade."
