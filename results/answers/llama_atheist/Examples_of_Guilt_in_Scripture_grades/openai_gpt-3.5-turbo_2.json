  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of guilt in the Bible, showcasing various examples and contexts. However, the response does not directly address the concern raised about understanding guilt in the context of justice, innocence, and divine judgment as explicitly outlined in the provided answer. To improve the grade, the response should have explicitly connected the examples provided to the need for divine judgment highlighted in the concern."
