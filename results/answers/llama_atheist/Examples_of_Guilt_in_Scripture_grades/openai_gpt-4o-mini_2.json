  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of how guilt is depicted in various biblical narratives, supported by relevant examples and explanations. However, it does not directly address the concern raised regarding the relationship between guilt, justice, and divine judgment. To improve the grade, the response could incorporate a more explicit connection between the examples given and the need for divine judgment in the context of justice and innocence."
