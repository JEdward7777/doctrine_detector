  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough examination of various miracles attributed to Jesus, exploring their reported significance and potential symbolic meanings. However, the response lacks a clear acknowledgment of the divine nature of Jesus and the foundational belief in the supernatural aspect of these miracles from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate Scriptural references affirming Jesus as the Son of God and the miracles as signs of His divinity and power. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of faith in understanding and accepting these miracles would align the response more closely with a Christian-specific worldview."
