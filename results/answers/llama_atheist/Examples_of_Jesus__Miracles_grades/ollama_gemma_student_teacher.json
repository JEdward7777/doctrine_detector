  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced approach to the question, considering both the historical and cultural contexts of Jesus' miracles. They provide detailed examples of several miracles and their significance, highlighting their potential to demonstrate Jesus' divinity, compassion, and authority. \n\nWhile the student acknowledges the limitations of historical verification and supernatural claims, they offer insightful interpretations of the miracles within their cultural framework. Their conclusion encourages critical examination and emphasizes the symbolic power of these events.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from a more explicit statement of how the miracles align with the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God. Additionally, the student's answer does not address the concern regarding the significance of Jesus' miracles in strengthening their belief in Him as the Son of God, as specified in the prompt."
