However, the perspective presented lacks an acknowledgment of the spiritual significance and divine involvement in shaping Abram's faith. As a scholar examining the topic from a cultural and historical standpoint, there is a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the supernatural dimension of faith in God's promises as a foundation for believers. Greater emphasis on the role of God's sovereignty and faithfulness in encouraging believers to trust in His word could have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview."
