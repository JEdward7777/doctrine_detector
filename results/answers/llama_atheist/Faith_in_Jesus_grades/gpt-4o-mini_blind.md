Comments: The response completely avoids addressing the question from a Christian worldview perspective. It would be more appropriate to explain the concept of "believing in Jesus" as understood within Christian faith, even if the student personally does not adhere to such beliefs. Engaging with the question from a Christian perspective is key in this context.
