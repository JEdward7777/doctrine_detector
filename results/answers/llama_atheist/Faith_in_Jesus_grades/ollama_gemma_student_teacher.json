  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of faith and trust in Jesus, but it lacks specificity and fails to elaborate on the practical implications of belief in Jesus. The response adequately explains the core elements of believing in Jesus, but it could benefit from further elaboration on how faith in Jesus affects personal life."
