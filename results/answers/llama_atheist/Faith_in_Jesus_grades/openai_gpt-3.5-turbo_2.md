## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response does not address the concern raised about understanding the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life. It simply restates the initial answer that assumes the existence of Jesus, which the respondent has expressed they cannot do. It does not engage with the specified concern from a Christian worldview.
