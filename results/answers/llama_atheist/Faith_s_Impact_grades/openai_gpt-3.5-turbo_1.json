The focus on cultural relevance and inclusivity, while important, detracts from the Christian-specific worldview of recognizing genuine faith through the evidence of good fruits. The response could benefit from a more explicit connection to how the indwelling of the Holy Spirit leads to transformation and the manifestation of faith in daily life."
