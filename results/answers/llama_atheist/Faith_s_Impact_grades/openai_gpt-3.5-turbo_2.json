The focus on cultural relevance and inclusivity, while important, should not overshadow the core Christian doctrine that genuine faith is a result of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Encouraging a deeper exploration of how the Holy Spirit influences and manifests in daily life would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
