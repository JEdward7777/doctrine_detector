  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provided a thoughtful and nuanced perspective on how true faith in Jesus might manifest in a person's life, touching on key aspects such as authenticity, compassion, humility, service, spiritual discernment, inclusivity, and resilience. However, the answer did not directly address the concern of recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life as stated in the question prompt. While the response provided valuable insights, the lack of direct connection to the specified concern lowers the grade slightly."
