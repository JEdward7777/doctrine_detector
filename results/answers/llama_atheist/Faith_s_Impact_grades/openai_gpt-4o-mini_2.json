  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response attempts to provide a comprehensive list of ways true faith in Jesus might manifest in a person's life, it lacks a clear connection to the core Christian belief that true faith produces good spiritual fruits or behaviors due to the presence of the Holy Spirit. The emphasis on cultural relevance and inclusivity, while important, somewhat detracts from the central Christian perspective on the evidence of genuine faith in daily life. A stronger integration of the central Christian belief along with the suggested manifestations of faith would have resulted in a higher grade."
