## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of human relationships and our most intimate bonds. As an atheist scholar, I must approach this inquiry through a historical-critical lens, examining the cultural and social contexts within which the biblical texts were written.

Regarding faithfulness in marriage and adultery, the Bible offers several perspectives across different books and genres. In the Hebrew Bible, there are varying degrees of condemnation towards adultery, reflecting the evolving moral codes of ancient Israelite society.

In Exodus 20:17 (Deuteronomy 5:18), the Decalogue prohibits committing "adultery" as a violation of God's commandments. This prohibition is part of the broader theme of respecting and honoring one's neighbor's property, including their spouse.

The book of Leviticus (18:20-23) expands on this prohibition, outlining penalties for adultery, including death by stoning or fines. However, it also acknowledges that a man who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife may be forced to compensate the injured party and offer a guilt offering to God.

In the New Testament, Jesus reiterates the importance of marital fidelity in Mark 10:11-12, stating that anyone who divorces their spouse and marries another commits adultery. This teaching is reinforced by Paul in Ephesians 5:25-33, where he emphasizes the mutual commitment and love between husband and wife, with faithfulness being a crucial aspect.

It's essential to note that these biblical teachings must be understood within the cultural and social contexts of ancient Israelite and Mediterranean societies. In those times, marriage was often viewed as a social and economic arrangement, rather than an emotional or romantic partnership.

When applying these teachings to modern situations, we should consider the evolving understanding of marriage, family, and human relationships. It's crucial to balance biblical principles with contemporary cultural and societal norms, recognizing that different cultures and societies have their unique values and practices regarding marriage and adultery.

Ultimately, as an atheist scholar, I believe it's essential to approach these questions through a critical examination of historical contexts, literary genres, and theological themes, rather than relying solely on dogmatic or literal interpretations. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding faithfulness in marriage and adultery, as well as the ongoing human quest for meaningful relationships and personal fulfillment.
