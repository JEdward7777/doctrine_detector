The exploration of cultural and societal contexts adds depth to the discussion. However, the response lacks a specific focus on how Christians are called to maintain integrity and faithfulness in marriages from a Christian worldview, as requested in the concern. The analysis could have been strengthened by emphasizing the importance of fidelity in reflecting God's sacrificial love and by highlighting the Christian duty to uphold the sanctity of marriage as a reflection of Christ's relationship with His church."
