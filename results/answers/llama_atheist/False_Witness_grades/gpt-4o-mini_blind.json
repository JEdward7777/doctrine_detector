The explanation of why giving false testimony is significant in a Christian context is well-supported with references to John 17:3, Matthew 5:33-37, 1 John 2:27-28, and John 17:6. The student successfully conveys the gravity of this sin and its implications within a Christian community. To strengthen the answer, deeper theological reflections on the nature of truth, the character of God, and the consequences of false testimony could be incorporated."
