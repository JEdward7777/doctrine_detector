  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out secular perspective on favoritism and its implications for relationships. However, the response did not address the concern of avoiding favoritism from a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, favoritism goes against the teachings of treating others as we would like to be treated and loving our neighbors equally. The student missed the opportunity to discuss how Christians should strive to show love and fairness to all individuals, regardless of personal biases or preferences."
