  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of favoritism from a secular perspective, acknowledging both positive and negative consequences. It offers practical strategies to mitigate the negative effects of favoritism. While the response does not address the Christian concern directly, it aligns with the Christian value of treating all individuals fairly and lovingly. The suggestions on transparency, inclusivity, and recognizing impact align well with Christian principles. The only improvement could be explicitly tying these strategies to Christian values to make the connection more explicit. Overall, a well-reasoned and thoughtful response."
