The student demonstrates an understanding of the concept through relevant scriptural references and explanations. However, there could have been a more explicit emphasis on the importance of grace as a key component in finding favor with God. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the significance of finding favor in the context of redemption and salvation through Christ. Nonetheless, the response effectively conveys the general idea of finding favor with both God and humans."
