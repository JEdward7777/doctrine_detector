  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-articulated and thoughtful analysis of the phrase \"find grace in the eyes of God\" from both a religious and secular perspective, they missed the mark in addressing the Christian-specific worldview concern. The student's emphasis on viewing the concept from a secular and atheistic perspective detracts from the Christian understanding of seeking and recognizing God's favor in one's life. The response could have benefited from a more focused exploration of how Christians can cultivate a relationship with God to receive His grace and favor."
