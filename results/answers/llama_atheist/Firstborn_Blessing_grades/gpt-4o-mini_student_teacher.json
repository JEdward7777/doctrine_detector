  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-written and inclusive of various perspectives, significantly misses the mark in addressing the question from a Christian worldview. The answer fails to connect the concept of birthright to leading one's family in faith, stewardship, and inheritance as outlined in the reference answer. Additionally, the response focuses more on general cultural and secular interpretations rather than delving into the spiritual implications within a Christian family context. A stronger emphasis on Biblical teachings and the specific spiritual responsibilities associated with the concept of birthright would have been more appropriate."
