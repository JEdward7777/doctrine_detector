  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured explanation of the relationship between \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" in Christian teachings. They correctly outlined the nuances between the two terms and how they are used within theological contexts. However, the student's explanation was more detailed and complex than the reference answer, which may have slightly deviated from the primary concern of clarifying the relationship between similar theological concepts. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic was demonstrated."
