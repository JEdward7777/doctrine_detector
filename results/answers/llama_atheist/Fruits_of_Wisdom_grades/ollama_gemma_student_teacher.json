  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of the fruits of the Holy Spirit. While they approach the topic from a secular perspective, they identify values and qualities that align well with Christian teachings. The inclusion of specific examples of these traits further strengthens the response. However, the absence of direct reference to the Holy Spirit or divine guidance slightly lowers the score. Overall, this is a strong and well-written response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the Christian worldview."
