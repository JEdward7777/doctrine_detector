## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a secular scholar, I will provide an analysis of the importance of fulfilling promises or vows made before God from a biblical and theological perspective.

In the Christian tradition, keeping one's promises or vows before God is seen as a fundamental aspect of faithfulness and obedience to God. The Bible emphasizes the importance of being faithful in our commitments and keeping our word (Numbers 30:2, Deuteronomy 23:21-23). This principle is rooted in God's own character and nature, who is often described as faithful and trustworthy (Deuteronomy 7:9, Psalm 119:137).

In the New Testament, Jesus emphasizes the importance of keeping one's word and being a person of integrity. In Matthew 5:33-37, Jesus teaches that swearing oaths or making promises before God is unnecessary because our words should be governed by the truthfulness of our hearts. He encourages his followers to let their "yes" be "yes" and their "no" be "no," implying that keeping one's word is essential.

Paul also emphasizes the importance of being faithful in our commitments, whether made before God or human beings (Romans 1:9, 2 Corinthians 1:17-20). He sees faithfulness as a reflection of one's relationship with God and as a means to build trust and credibility with others.

In summary, from a Christian perspective, fulfilling promises or vows made before God is seen as a vital aspect of faithfulness, obedience, and integrity. It reflects the character of God himself and is essential for building trust and credibility with both God and human beings.
