  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the importance of fulfilling promises or vows made before God from a biblical and theological perspective. The student references relevant Bible verses and teachings of Jesus and Paul to support their points. However, there is room for improvement in explicitly stating the gravity of making vows before God and the consequences of breaking them. Additionally, the inclusion of examples or parables illustrating the importance of keeping promises before God could further enhance the depth of the response."
