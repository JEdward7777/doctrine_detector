  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful analysis from a biblical and theological perspective on the importance of fulfilling promises or vows made before God. They effectively cited relevant scriptures and teachings from both the Old and New Testaments to support their points. However, the answer could have been more concise and directly addressed the concern by emphasizing the personal responsibility and spiritual significance of keeping one's word before God. Overall, a strong effort with room for slight improvement in focus and clarity."
