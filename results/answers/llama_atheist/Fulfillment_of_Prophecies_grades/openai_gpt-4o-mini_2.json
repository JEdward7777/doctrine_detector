The student effectively utilizes biblical examples and criteria for interpreting prophecy fulfillment. The discussion is relevant to the concern of understanding how God interacts with prophecy in Scripture. The only minor area for improvement would be to more explicitly tie in the statement that \"God causes to happen what was predicted in the prophecy\" with the broader discussion on criteria for determining prophecy fulfillment."
