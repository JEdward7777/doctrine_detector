Additionally, while the author acknowledges the importance of considering cultural context, literary genres, and historical background in biblical interpretation, a brief example or illustration could have been included to support this claim.\n\nOverall, this is a well-organized and informative response that effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a strong understanding of the role of fulfilled prophecies in Christian faith."
