  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a comprehensive exploration of how different cultures and belief systems interpret the concept of \"holy place,\" their answer does not align with the Christian worldview provided by the reference answer. The Christian perspective emphasizes setting apart places for God's worship and recognizing their sacredness in relation to divine encounter. The student's response, although insightful from a comparative religious studies standpoint, lacks the foundational Christian understanding of holy places."
