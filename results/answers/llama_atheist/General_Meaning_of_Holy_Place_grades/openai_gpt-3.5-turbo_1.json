The response from an atheist perspective did not engage with the specific Christian understanding of a holy place being set apart for God and intended for worship. Instead, it presented a more generalized and secular view of sacred spaces. In a Christian worldview, a holy place goes beyond cultural or psychological significance to embody a direct connection to the divine and the practice of worship."
