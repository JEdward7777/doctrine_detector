However, it falls short of addressing the concern of spiritual gifts related to evangelism from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could have integrated biblical references or theological insights to emphasize the spiritual aspect of evangelism as a gift from God for the edification of the church. Incorporating scriptural support and emphasizing the supernatural aspect of spiritual gifts would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
