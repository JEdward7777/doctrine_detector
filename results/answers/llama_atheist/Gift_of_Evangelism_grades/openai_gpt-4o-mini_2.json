However, it falls short of addressing the concern regarding spiritual gifts and their role in evangelism within the Christian worldview. While the response provides valuable insights, it lacks a clear connection to the spiritual aspect and theological underpinnings of evangelism as a spiritual gift within the church. An integration of scriptural perspectives and theological understanding of this spiritual gift would have enhanced the response from a Christian-specific worldview perspective."
