  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and respectful explanation of how believers might actively glorify God in their daily lives from an outside perspective. They have accurately highlighted various practices and perspectives, showing understanding and sensitivity towards religious beliefs.
