The emphasis on living according to God's character and commandments, as well as sharing testimonies of His goodness, aligns well with the concern of emphasizing the importance of honoring God's greatness. The only minor deduction is due to the inclusion of an atheist perspective, which, while offering cultural context, could potentially dilute the focus on glorifying God from a Christian worldview perspective."
