  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural and linguistic context of Jesus' statement in Mark 10:18 from an atheist scholar's perspective. However, the student's perspective lacks a Christian worldview in recognizing God as the ultimate source of goodness. The student does not fully grasp the Christian concept of God's moral perfection and righteousness as the standard of goodness. The response would benefit from incorporating a deeper understanding of Jesus' statement within a Christian framework."
