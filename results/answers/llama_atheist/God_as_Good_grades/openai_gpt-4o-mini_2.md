## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist scholar, I would approach this question from a historical-critical perspective, examining the cultural and linguistic context of Jesus' statement in Mark 10:18. It's essential to understand that the concept of "good" in ancient Jewish thought was not a moral absolute but rather a relative term often used to describe God's character or actions.

In Jewish tradition, God is considered "good" because He is just, merciful, and benevolent (see Psalm 119:68). However, this notion of "goodness" might not necessarily apply to all human actions. In fact, the Hebrew Bible presents a complex moral landscape where God's actions can be both good and evil (e.g., Deuteronomy 8:3; Isaiah 45:7).

Jesus' statement in Mark 10:18 should be seen within this Jewish context. When Jesus says that there is only one who is good, and that is God, he might be highlighting God's unique character as the ultimate standard of goodness. This could be a way for Jesus to emphasize God's transcendent nature, setting Him apart from human beings.

Moreover, by saying that God is the only one who is good, Jesus might be subtly distancing himself from the Jewish tradition, which often emphasized the importance of following God's commandments (see Leviticus 19:2) and the concept of "good" being tied to obedience (Deuteronomy 8:3).

In this context, Jesus' statement could be seen as a way to reorient his audience's understanding of what it means to be good. Rather than relying on human standards or self-righteousness, Jesus might be pointing to God as the ultimate source and standard of goodness.

As an atheist scholar, I would caution against reading too much moral theology into this passage. Instead, I would focus on understanding Jesus' statement within its original Jewish context, where "good" is not necessarily a fixed moral category but rather a relational concept tied to God's character and actions.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a well-reasoned and insightful analysis of Jesus' statement in Mark 10:18 within its Jewish context, emphasizing the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness. The atheist scholar effectively discusses the concept of "good" in ancient Jewish thought and highlights the importance of understanding God's character as the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs. However, from a Christian worldview, the response lacks acknowledgment of Jesus' divinity and how his statement reflects the inherent goodness of God incarnate in human form. While the analysis is thorough, a Christian perspective would also emphasize the role of Jesus as the embodiment of God's goodness, leading to a slightly lower grade.
