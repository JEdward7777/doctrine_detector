  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not address the concern of recognizing the significance of being chosen by God. Their perspective, while valid from a cultural and historical standpoint, completely disregards the theological aspect of God's selective grace towards His people. A Christian worldview acknowledges the concept of a remnant as a demonstration of God's sovereign choice and favor, which the student's answer fails to reflect."
