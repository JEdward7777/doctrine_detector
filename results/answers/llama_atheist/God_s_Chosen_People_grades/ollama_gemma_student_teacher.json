  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of a \"remnant\" from both cultural and historical perspectives. They provide a thoughtful analysis of the idea as a reflection of societal dynamics and human values, while appropriately acknowledging the absence of supernatural or divine entities from their own perspective. The student's ability to connect the concept to the idea of God's selective grace, even while maintaining their own non-theological stance, shows a nuanced grasp of the theological significance of the term."
