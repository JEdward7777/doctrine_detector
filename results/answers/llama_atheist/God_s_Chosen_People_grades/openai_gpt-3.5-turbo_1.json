As a Christian, the belief in God's selective grace and the concept of a remnant is foundational. The perspective provided here, from an atheistic viewpoint, dismisses the theological implications entirely. From a Christian worldview, understanding the concept of the remnant solely as a cultural and historical phenomenon misses the core essence of God's sovereignty and His relationship with His chosen people."
