From a Christian worldview, the acknowledgment of God's selectivity and grace towards certain individuals or groups is crucial in interpreting the concept of a remnant. This response dismisses the theological aspect and fails to engage with the idea of divine intervention and purpose behind the concept of a remnant, ultimately missing an important element of the question."
