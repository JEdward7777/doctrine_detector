They have shown an understanding of the complexities of God's nature as presented in the Bible. However, the answer could have been more focused on directly addressing the concern about how God's compassion influences our understanding of divine love and mercy instead of just presenting a general analysis of compassion in the biblical text. More emphasis could have been placed on the impact of God's compassion on our perception of divine love and mercy, which would have strengthened the response."
