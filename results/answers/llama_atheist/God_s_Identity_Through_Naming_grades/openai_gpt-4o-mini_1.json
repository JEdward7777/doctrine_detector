However, it deviated from the Christian specific worldview by approaching the topic from an atheist perspective rather than addressing the implications of identity and belonging to God in a Christian's life. While the response touched on the desire for recognition, belonging, and connection, it lacked a direct connection to the Christian understanding of being called by God's name and the personal relationship and identity with Him. A more focused discussion on how this concept relates to Christian beliefs and practices would have been beneficial."
