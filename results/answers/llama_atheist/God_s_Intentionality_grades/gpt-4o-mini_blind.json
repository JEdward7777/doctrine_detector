  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student made an effort to explore the concept of \"calling\" in a secular context, which is commendable. However, the answer lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the significance of God's calling. It does not address the theological implications of God's intentionality and purpose in His calling, missing a crucial aspect of the question. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating biblical references and emphasizing God's sovereign will in His calling of individuals."
