  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does address the concern of recognizing the intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity, as it explores the concept of \"calling\" within the context of human experience and language. The author acknowledges that many people believe God is an intentional and purposeful being, which aligns with the concern.\n\nHowever, the response falls short in fully embracing the intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity. While it acknowledges the connection between human communication and God's calling, it also emphasizes the cultural constructedness of the concept of \"calling.\" This focus on human perspective and language might detract from the idea that God's call is not just a product of human experience but also an objective reality.\n\nThe response does touch on the idea that God's call is not random, which aligns with the given answer. Nevertheless, it could have explored this concept further to provide more insight into the intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity.\n\nOverall, while the response addresses some aspects of the concern, it could have delved deeper into the topic and provided more biblical support for the idea that God's call is deliberate and intentional."
