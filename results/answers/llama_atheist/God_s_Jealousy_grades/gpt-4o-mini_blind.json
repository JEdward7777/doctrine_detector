  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and thorough explanation of the concept of God's jealousy in the Bible, considering the cultural and historical context. The response correctly emphasized God's deep investment in His covenantal relationship with Israel and avoided misconstruing divine jealousy as a justification for negative human behaviors. The use of scriptural references and analogy from Hosea added depth to the discussion. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound answer."
