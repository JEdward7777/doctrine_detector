  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched explanation of the concept of God's jealousy in the Bible, considering its cultural and historical context. The student effectively articulated how God's jealousy reflects His deep investment in the covenantal relationship with His people. However, the answer could have further emphasized the aspect of God's strong desire for His people to remain faithful to Him and keep Him foremost in their affections, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
