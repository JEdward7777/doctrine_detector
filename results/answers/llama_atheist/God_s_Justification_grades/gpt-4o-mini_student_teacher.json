  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: \nThe student provided a thorough explanation of the Christian doctrine of justification despite their atheistic perspective. They accurately described the concept of justification in Christian theology and its implications. However, the response lacks alignment with a Christian worldview as it dismisses the foundational belief in God's existence and the concept of sin. While the student demonstrated an understanding of the topic, the lack of acknowledgement of the Christian faith's core beliefs significantly impacts the grading."
