  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Christian doctrine of justification and its theological significance. They clearly articulate the process of justification as a forensic act and explain the key elements involved. The inclusion of relevant biblical references reinforces the accuracy and depth of the response. While the student expresses an atheist perspective and does not accept the theological claims, their explanation of the concept provides valuable insights for students with a Christian worldview."
