However, it fundamentally undermines the importance of understanding God's omnipotence in relation to faith and worship by emphasizing cultural and historical contexts over the theological significance of the term \"Almighty.\" It fails to acknowledge the foundational belief in God's absolute power and authority as essential to Christian faith and worship."
