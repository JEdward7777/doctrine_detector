  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The response deviates significantly from the provided answer and concern. While it provides an interesting critical perspective, it undermines the fundamental concept of God's omnipotence and the importance of understanding it in the context of faith and worship from a Christian worldview. The response focuses more on historical and mythological interpretations rather than addressing the concern raised."
