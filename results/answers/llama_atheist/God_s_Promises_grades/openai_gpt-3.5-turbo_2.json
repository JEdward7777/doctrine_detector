However, the response falls short in addressing the concern directly. While the secular perspective is valuable, it does not fully engage with the core issue of how understanding God's promises helps believers trust His faithfulness in their own lives. More emphasis on the spiritual impact and personal significance of God's promises for believers would have enhanced the response."
