  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The response provided, while well-intentioned, completely disregards the Christian worldview and the belief in divine providence. From a Christian perspective, discerning God's plans involves prayer, seeking biblical guidance, and aligning one's will with God's will. This response fails to address the core beliefs of the worldview in question. It presents a humanistic approach devoid of acknowledging God's sovereign authority and guidance in a Christian's life. The student should have at least acknowledged the Christian perspective and provided insight from that viewpoint while still offering alternative suggestions for a non-believer."
