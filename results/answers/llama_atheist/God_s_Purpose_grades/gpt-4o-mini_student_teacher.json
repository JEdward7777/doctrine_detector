  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well articulated and informative in a secular context, does not address the concern from a Christian worldview. As a Christian, discerning God's plan involves seeking guidance through prayer, Scripture, and the wisdom of fellow believers. The response provided by the student does not align with this perspective, earning a low grade in this context."
