  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response is comprehensive and well-written from a secular perspective that considers cultural and psychological factors. However, the answer falls short in addressing the specific concern of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation. From a Christian worldview, the student's answer lacks acknowledgment of God's central role in the new birth experience. While interdisciplinary perspectives are valuable, it is essential to prioritize the theological understanding of the topic."
