  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of \"being born again\" from both scientific and cultural perspectives. They acknowledge the lack of empirical evidence for a literal rebirth but explore the idea as a metaphorical representation of profound change. While the student does not explicitly mention God's role in the process, they recognize the importance of spirituality and the symbolic significance of higher power in human experiences. However, the answer could benefit from more direct engagement with the provided reference answer, which emphasizes God's sovereignty and grace in salvation."
