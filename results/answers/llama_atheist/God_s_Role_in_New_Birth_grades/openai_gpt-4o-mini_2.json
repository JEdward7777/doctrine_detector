While it acknowledges the cultural and psychological aspects surrounding spiritual transformations, the focus on a purely human-centered interpretation undermines the central Christian belief that being born again is a work of God's grace. The answer does not align with a Christian worldview that emphasizes the necessity of divine intervention in the process of spiritual rebirth."
