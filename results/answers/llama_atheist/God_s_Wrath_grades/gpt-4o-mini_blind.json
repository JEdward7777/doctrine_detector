The descriptions from Joel and Amos accurately portray the catastrophic nature of God's judgment. However, the inclusion of the personal note at the end as an \"atheistic scholar\" detracts from a purely objective analysis within a Christian worldview. Furthermore, it would have been beneficial to highlight the overarching theme of God's justice and righteousness in executing His judgment, underscoring the importance of repentance and obedience to avoid such punishment."
