  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of how God's punishment is described during the 'Day of Yahweh' based on biblical passages. They highlighted the themes of cosmic upheaval, destruction, chaos, and judgment, aligning well with the concern of recognizing the consequences for disbelief. However, the student missed explicitly mentioning that God's punishment is described as a 'pouring out of God\u2019s wrath' upon those who do not believe, which was the specific reference answer provided by the teacher. It is important to directly address the specific concern raised in the reference answer for a more complete response from a Christian worldview."
