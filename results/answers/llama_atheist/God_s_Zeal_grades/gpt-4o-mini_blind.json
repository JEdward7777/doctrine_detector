  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and demonstrates an understanding of how the concept of zeal was viewed in ancient Near Eastern cultures. However, the answer strays from a Christian specific worldview by avoiding direct theological exploration of the term \"zeal of the Lord.\" Instead, it focuses more on a secular interpretation, neglecting to delve into the biblical implications of God's zeal towards His people. The student should provide a more doctrinally sound analysis grounded in Christian beliefs to improve the grade."
