  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer strays too far from the Christian worldview by focusing solely on a secular perspective and dismissing theological interpretations. The answer lacks depth in connecting God's zeal to His actions towards His people and fails to address the concern of deepening believers' trust in God's commitment to their well-being. A more focused and scripturally-based response would have better reflected God's character and intentions towards His people."
