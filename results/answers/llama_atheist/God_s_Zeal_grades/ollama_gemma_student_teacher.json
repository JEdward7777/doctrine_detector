  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the biblical concept of \"zeal of the Lord.\" The student provides a thorough analysis of the term within its historical and cultural context, drawing parallels to human emotions and motivations. The inclusion of secular perspectives and interpretations adds depth to the discussion. While the student's answer aligns well with the given reference answer, it could benefit from a more explicit statement connecting the \"zeal of the Lord\" to God's actions towards His people."
