  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a well-developed exploration of the concept of the \"zeal of the Lord\" from a secular perspective, acknowledging the cultural and historical context. While the analysis is insightful, the concern regarding recognizing God's zeal to deepen believers' trust in His commitment is not directly addressed. The response could have been strengthened by integrating more explicitly Christian worldview perspectives on God's zeal and its impact on believers' trust and well-being."
