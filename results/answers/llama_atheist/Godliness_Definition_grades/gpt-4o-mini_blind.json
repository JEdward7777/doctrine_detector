The student effectively incorporates various passages from both the Old and New Testaments to support their explanation of godliness as obedience to God's will and character. The analysis is thorough and demonstrates a clear grasp of the concept within Christian theology. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to emphasize the importance of faith in Christ as essential for true godliness, as Jesus is the ultimate example and source of living a godly life."
