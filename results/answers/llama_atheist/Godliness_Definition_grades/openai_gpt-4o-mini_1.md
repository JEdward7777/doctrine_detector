## [Answer](../Godliness_Definition.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I'll provide an answer based on the biblical text itself, without injecting personal beliefs or assumptions. In the context of living one's life, "godliness" (or Greek: εὐσέβεια, eusebeia) in the Bible is closely tied to obedience to God's will and character.

In 1 Timothy 2:2-3, Paul instructs Timothy to pray for kings and all those in authority that they may live a life of godliness (εὐσέβεια). Here, godliness seems to be synonymous with living according to God's standards, which are based on His nature revealed through creation (Romans 1:20) and His Word.

In the Old Testament, godliness is often associated with the Hebrew concept of "fear of the Lord" (Yirah), which involves acknowledging and respecting God's power, wisdom, and character. This fear or reverence is seen as a foundation for right living (Deuteronomy 6:13; Psalm 111:10).

The prophet Micah emphasizes that to live godly means to "do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God" (Micah 6:8). This passage highlights the importance of practicing social justice, showing compassion, and having a humble attitude towards God.

Jesus Christ also taught about godliness. In Matthew 22:37-40, He emphasized that loving God with one's whole being (heart, soul, mind, and strength) is the greatest commandment. This love for God involves obeying His commands and embracing His character, which is revealed in Jesus' teachings.

In the New Testament epistles, godliness is linked to living a life of faith, hope, and self-control (1 Peter 2:3; 4:8; 5:10). It also involves walking with God through obedience to His Word, trusting Him, and resting in His sovereignty (Psalm 37:5-6).

In summary, the Bible defines godliness as living according to God's standards, which are based on His nature and character. This involves practicing social justice, showing compassion, having a humble attitude towards God, loving Him with one's whole being, and walking with Him through obedience to His Word.
