While the secular analysis is informative, it lacks a Christian-specific worldview in discussing the supernatural origin and significance of these virtues. To improve, the response could benefit from incorporating insights on how Christians believe these traits are empowered by the Holy Spirit and how individuals can cultivate them through faith and obedience to God."
