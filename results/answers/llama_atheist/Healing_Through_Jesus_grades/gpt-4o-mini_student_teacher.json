  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer provides an in-depth analysis of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals from a scholarly and historical perspective, but it lacks a consideration of the Christian worldview concerning the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the role of prayer and faith in healing. The student's emphasis on cultural and linguistic aspects, while interesting, does not align with the specified concern. A Christian perspective would emphasize the power and authority of Jesus in casting out demons through prayer and faith."
