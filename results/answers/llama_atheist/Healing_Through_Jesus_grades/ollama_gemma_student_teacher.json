  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the biblical accounts of Jesus healing demon-possessed individuals. The student provides a comprehensive analysis of Jesus' approach, considering spiritual confrontation, divine language, faith, physical contact, and association with the marginalized. The student's atheism does not detract from the quality of the answer, as it allows for an objective analysis of the biblical data."
