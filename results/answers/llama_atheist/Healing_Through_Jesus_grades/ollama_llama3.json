  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student provides a thorough analysis of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals, highlighting key features such as spiritual confrontation, use of divine language, emphasis on faith, physical contact, and association with the marginalized. They also demonstrate an understanding of the cultural and historical contexts in which Jesus operated.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about recognizing the authority of Jesus over evil spirits or the power of prayer and faith in healing. While the student notes that Jesus' approach may have been intended to demonstrate his authority and connection to those he healed, they do not explicitly affirm Jesus' divine authority or the role of faith in the healing process.\n\nOverall, the response is strong in its analysis and demonstration of understanding, but falls short in directly addressing the concern."
