However, the response did not explicitly address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing, which are central aspects of the Christian worldview when it comes to healing demon-possessed individuals. The response from an atheist perspective lacks an acknowledgment of the supernatural elements and divine intervention attributed to Jesus in casting out demons, which are foundational beliefs in a Christian worldview."
