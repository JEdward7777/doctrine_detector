However, it falls short of recognizing the ultimate authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the significance of prayer and faith in the healing process, as emphasized in a Christian worldview. The analysis lacks acknowledgment of the supernatural aspect of Jesus' ability to cast out demons and the role of faith in invoking divine intervention. While the scholarly insights are insightful, they do not fully align with the Christian perspective on spiritual healing."
