  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough exploration of anointing in the New Testament from a cultural-critical perspective, acknowledging its significance in early Christian communities. However, as a Christian-specific worldview is being applied here, the response lacks emphasis on the theological and doctrinal aspects of anointing related to healing. The student did well in discussing the historical and cultural context but could improve by integrating more scriptural references and theological insights concerning the spiritual significance of anointing for healing in Christianity."
