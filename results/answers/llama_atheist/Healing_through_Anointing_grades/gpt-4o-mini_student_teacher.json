  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and thorough answer exploring the practice of anointing in the New Testament from a cultural-critical perspective. However, the student's approach as an atheistic scholar may lead to interpretations that do not align with a Christian worldview. The answer lacks explicit mention of the spiritual significance of anointing in relation to healing as emphasized in Christian practice. The student's focus on cultural aspects is informative but does not fully address the concern of recognizing anointing in spiritual and physical healing within a Christian context."
