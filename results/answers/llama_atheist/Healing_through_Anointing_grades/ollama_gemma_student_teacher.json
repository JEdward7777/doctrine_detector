  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer is well-written and provides a comprehensive overview of the practice of anointing in the New Testament and its relationship to healing. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the cultural and religious significance of anointing in early Christian communities. The answer is well-researched and provides relevant examples from the Gospels and other early Christian sources. However, the student's atheism perspective and focus on cultural-critical analysis slightly detracts from the explicitly Christian concern of the question."
