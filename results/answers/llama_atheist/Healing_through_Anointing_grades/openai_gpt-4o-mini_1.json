  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a well-researched and insightful exploration of anointing in the context of healing within early Christian communities. The discussion draws on relevant biblical passages and historical practices to demonstrate the significance of anointing for spiritual and physical well-being. However, the response could have further emphasized the central role of God's intervention and healing power in the process of anointing for healing, specifically from a Christian worldview perspective."
