  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the roles of different individuals in approaching the Ark of the Covenant and the specific protocols involved. They correctly highlighted the importance of ritual purification, proper attire, and reverence. However, the student included additional groups like purified priests and the Levites, which goes beyond the specific reference answer that only the high priest could approach the ark, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement."
