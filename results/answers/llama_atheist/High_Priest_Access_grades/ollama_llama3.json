  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nWhile the response does mention the high priest's role in approaching the Ark, it also provides additional information about other individuals who could approach the Ark, including purified priests and Levites. This added detail is helpful in understanding the broader context of the Israelite cultic system.\n\nHowever, the concern was specifically to recognize the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant. While the response does mention the high priest's annual visit to the Ark on Yom Kippur, it could have more explicitly emphasized the high priest's unique position as mediator between God and humanity.\n\nThe comment I would give is: \"This response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical text, but could have further highlighted the importance of the high priest's role in the Israelite's relationship with God. By providing additional context about other individuals who could approach the Ark, the response does well to situate the high priest within the broader cultic system, but could have more explicitly emphasized his unique position as mediator.\""
