## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that takes us into the realm of biblical studies!

According to the Hebrew Bible, specifically Leviticus 16:1-34 and Numbers 6:3-21, only a select group of people were permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant. These individuals were:

1. The High Priest (specifically Aaron and his sons): As part of their duties, they would enter the Holy of Holies once a year on Yom Kippur to offer sacrifices and atone for the sins of the Israelites.
2. Priests who had been purified: In Numbers 6:3-21, we find instructions for priests to be purified through a ritual process involving washing, shaving, and burning offerings. Once they had undergone this purification, they were allowed to approach the Ark.
3. The Levites: As descendants of Levi, these priests played a crucial role in the Israelite cultic system. They would assist the High Priest during rituals and ceremonies.

Under what circumstances? Well, there were specific protocols that needed to be followed:

1. Ritual purification was essential: Before approaching the Ark, individuals had to undergo ritual purification to ensure they were free from impurities.
2. Proper attire was required: Priests wore special garments when approaching the Ark, including linen robes and sacred vestments (Exodus 28:4-5).
3. Fear and reverence were necessary: One had to approach the Ark with reverence and a sense of awe, recognizing its sacredness and power (Hebrews 9:2-7).

In summary, only those who had undergone ritual purification, wore proper attire, and approached with fear and reverence were allowed to draw near the Ark of the Covenant.
