However, the approach taken in the response completely discounts the religious significance attributed to the practice in the biblical account. As a Christian worldview emphasizes the divine guidance and intervention in shaping religious practices, failing to acknowledge God's instruction to eat unleavened bread as part of the Israelites' deliverance from slavery overlooks a critical aspect of the historical events that shaped this religious practice."
