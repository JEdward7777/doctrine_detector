The response does not engage with the idea of divine instruction as the primary reason for the practice. In a Christian worldview, recognizing God's role in shaping and guiding religious practices is crucial, and this aspect is largely neglected in the response. Theories and speculations, while informative, do not align with the understanding that God's instructions were foundational in the Israelites' dietary choices during their deliverance from slavery."
