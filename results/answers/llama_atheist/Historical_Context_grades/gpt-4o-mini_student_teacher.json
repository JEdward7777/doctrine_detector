  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the concept of \"remnant\" in the prophetic books of Isaiah and Amos, supported by relevant biblical events. They successfully connect the idea of remnant to covenant faithfulness and provide a thorough explanation of how the remnant played a significant role in various historical contexts. However, the response could have included a clearer connection to the teacher's reference answer and elaborated more on the specific biblical events mentioned in Isaiah and Amos to further strengthen their argument from a Christian worldview perspective. Overall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
