  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of \"remnant\" in Isaiah and Amos, supported by relevant biblical events. The analysis is historically informed, culturally nuanced, and clearly articulates the tension between faithfulness and apostasy. The inclusion of the Maccabean Revolt as an example adds depth to the discussion. Overall, this is an excellent response that showcases advanced biblical knowledge and analytical skills."
