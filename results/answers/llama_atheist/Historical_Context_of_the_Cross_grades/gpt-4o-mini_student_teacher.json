  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough historical and cultural analysis of the Roman practice of crucifixion and its impact on the perception of the cross in early Christianity. The student accurately captures the initial association of the cross with shame and defeat, as well as the transformative shift brought about by Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. However, the student's emphasis on atheistic and purely secular perspectives detracts from a deeper exploration of the profound theological significance of the cross in Christianity. Incorporating more discussion on the spiritual implications and divine aspects of the symbol would enhance the analysis from a Christian worldview."
