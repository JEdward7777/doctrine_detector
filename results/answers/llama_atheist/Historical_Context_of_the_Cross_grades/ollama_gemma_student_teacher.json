  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the historical context of crucifixion and its significance in early Christianity. They effectively analyze the initial perception of the cross as a symbol of shame and humiliation, and how early Christians transformed it into a symbol of redemption and salvation through Jesus' resurrection. The inclusion of references to Paul's teachings and the theological significance of the cross adds depth to the analysis. The student's atheism does not impede their ability to provide a thoughtful and insightful response from a historical and cultural perspective."
