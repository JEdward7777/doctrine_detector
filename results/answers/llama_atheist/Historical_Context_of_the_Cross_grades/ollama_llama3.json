  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a great job of exploring the transformation of the symbol of the cross from one of shame and suffering to one of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection. The writer provides a clear and concise overview of the historical context of crucifixion in ancient Rome and its significance for early Christianity. The discussion of how early Christians reframed the cultural significance of the cross is also well-handled.\n\nHowever, I deduct 10 points because the response could be more explicitly tied to the concern. While the writer does discuss the transformation of the symbol of death into one of life and hope, it could be made more explicit that this is a central aspect of the Christian message. Additionally, as an atheist writing about Christian theology, the writer could do more to acknowledge and critically engage with the divine or supernatural forces that shape early Christian thought.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that provides a clear and well-organized discussion of the transformation of the symbol of the cross. With some further attention to explicitly connecting the discussion to the concern and engaging with the theological aspects of the topic, it could be even stronger."
