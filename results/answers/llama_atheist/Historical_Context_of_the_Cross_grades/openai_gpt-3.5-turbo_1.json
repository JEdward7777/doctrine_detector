  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-informed response that effectively explains the transformation of the symbol of the cross from one of shame and suffering to one of hope, victory, and eternal life within early Christianity. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian perspective on the significance of the cross and effectively addresses the concern provided. However, it is important to note that from a Christian worldview, the role of divine intervention and God's redemptive plan through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross should be emphasized more explicitly."
