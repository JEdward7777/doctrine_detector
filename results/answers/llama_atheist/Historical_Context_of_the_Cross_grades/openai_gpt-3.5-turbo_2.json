While the analysis is well-reasoned and insightful from a historical and cultural perspective, the perspective of faith and the role of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ are not acknowledged or considered in shaping the Christian understanding of the cross. Incorporating a Christian worldview that recognizes the divine significance of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection would have strengthened the response."
