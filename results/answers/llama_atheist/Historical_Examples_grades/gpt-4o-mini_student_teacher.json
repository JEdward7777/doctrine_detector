  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched response on the significance of building altars in ancient Near Eastern cultures, citing examples from the Hebrew Bible. However, the student's approach as an atheistic scholar lacks the Christian worldview perspective necessary for this assignment. The focus on cultural and historical context, while informative, does not address the concern of inspiring Christians to express their faith through intentional acts of worship. Additionally, the explanation does not highlight the faithfulness and commitment to God that Noah and Abraham exhibited through building altars, as emphasized in the reference answer."
