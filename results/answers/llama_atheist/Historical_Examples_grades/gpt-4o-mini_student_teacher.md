## [Answer](../Historical_Examples.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A most excellent question! As an atheistic scholar, I'll approach this topic from a cultural and historical perspective, highlighting the significance of building altars in ancient Near Eastern cultures.

In the Hebrew Bible, we find several instances where individuals build altars to mark important events, express gratitude, or demonstrate their devotion. Let's take a closer look at some examples:

1. Abraham (Genesis 12:7-8, 13:18): When God instructs Abraham to leave his homeland and journey to Canaan, he builds an altar in the land of Shechem. This act symbolizes his trust in God's promise to make him the father of a great nation. Similarly, when Abraham and Lot part ways, Abraham builds another altar in Beersheba, emphasizing his commitment to following God's guidance.
2. Jacob (Genesis 28:18-22): After wrestling with an angel and receiving a blessing from God, Jacob sets up a pillar and pours oil on it as a symbol of his gratitude and promise to worship God at that site.
3. Joshua (Joshua 4:1-10, 8:30-35): Following the Israelites' crossing of the Jordan River, Joshua builds an altar on Mount Ebal as a memorial to God's deliverance. This act serves as a witness to future generations and reiterates God's covenant with his people.
4. Samuel (1 Samuel 7:1-17): As the prophet Samuel dedicates the temple of the Lord in Mizpah, he builds an altar to atone for the Israelites' sin and to demonstrate their commitment to following God.

In these examples, building altars served several purposes:

* Marking significant events or milestones (e.g., Abraham's journey, Jacob's blessing)
* Expressing gratitude and devotion to a higher power (e.g., Joshua's altar, Samuel's dedication)
* Demonstrating a people's commitment to their gods or deity (e.g., the Israelites' covenant with Yahweh)
* Creating physical reminders of divine presence and involvement (e.g., Jacob's pillar)

In ancient Near Eastern cultures, building altars was a common practice across various societies. It signified respect for the land, the community, and the divine. The act of altar-building often accompanied rituals, sacrifices, or other forms of worship.

As an atheistic scholar, I'm not concerned with the supernatural significance of these events. Instead, I focus on understanding the cultural context and historical relevance of building altars in ancient societies. By doing so, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of human culture and the diverse ways people have expressed their connection to the land, community, and the divine throughout history.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my research on the cultural significance of ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats...

Grade: 50

Comment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched response on the significance of building altars in ancient Near Eastern cultures, citing examples from the Hebrew Bible. However, the student's approach as an atheistic scholar lacks the Christian worldview perspective necessary for this assignment. The focus on cultural and historical context, while informative, does not address the concern of inspiring Christians to express their faith through intentional acts of worship. Additionally, the explanation does not highlight the faithfulness and commitment to God that Noah and Abraham exhibited through building altars, as emphasized in the reference answer.
