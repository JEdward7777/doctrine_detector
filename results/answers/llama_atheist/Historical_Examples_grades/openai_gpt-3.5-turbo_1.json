However, the atheistic worldview and perspective ignore the supernatural and spiritual aspects of these events, missing the core Christian belief in the importance of faithfulness and commitment to God. The concern emphasizes the inspiration for Christians to express their faith through intentional acts of worship, which is not addressed or supported in the atheistic scholarly analysis presented."
