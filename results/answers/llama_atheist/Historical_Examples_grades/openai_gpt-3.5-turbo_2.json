While the scholar gives a detailed and informative analysis of building altars in ancient Near Eastern cultures, the response lacks any acknowledgement or discussion of how Christians today can draw inspiration from biblical examples like Noah and Abraham to deepen their own faith and worship practices. In a Christian worldview, the focus should be on how these historical examples can serve as models for expressing faith, devotion, and obedience to God in contemporary times."
