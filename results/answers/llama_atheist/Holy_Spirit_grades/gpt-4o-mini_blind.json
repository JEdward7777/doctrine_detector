However, from a Christian perspective, there are significant doctrinal concerns with the suggested approach. The Holy Spirit is a distinct person within the Godhead, and downplaying terms like \"Trinity\" or \"person of the Godhead\" can diminish the foundational Christian belief in the triune nature of God. Similarly, avoiding dogmatic language may lead to a watering down of essential theological truths about the Holy Spirit's role in salvation and sanctification. While seeking to connect with different cultures is important, it should not come at the expense of compromising on essential Christian doctrines."
