  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit in unfamiliar contexts, emphasizing cultural sensitivity, experiential aspects, and avoiding technical language. While the emphasis on respecting cultural context is commendable, the response could strengthen its connection to the specific concern by explicitly addressing how clear, contextual teaching can help prevent misconceptions about the Holy Spirit's identity and work. Overall, this response shows a good understanding of the importance of effective communication in theological teachings."
