However, the response falls short of addressing the concern raised about spiritual warfare and divine authority impacting a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. From a Christian worldview, it's essential to highlight the significance of understanding the spiritual realm and the role of angelic beings in spiritual warfare, which can greatly influence one's approach to prayer and facing spiritual battles. The response could have integrated these aspects more explicitly to better align with a Christian worldview perspective."
