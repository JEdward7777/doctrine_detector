However, it lacks acknowledgment of the spiritual warfare aspect and the impact of divine authority on prayer and spiritual battles from a Christian worldview. The analysis could have been enhanced by addressing how the understanding of heavenly hosts relates to spiritual warfare and the authority believers have in prayer. Integrating these elements would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
