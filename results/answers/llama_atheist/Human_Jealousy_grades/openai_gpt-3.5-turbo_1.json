The response lacks a Christian-specific perspective on jealousy as it pertains to sin, trust in God's plan, and the importance of seeking reconciliation and forgiveness in relationships. Encouraging seeking support from a therapist is helpful, but integrating biblical principles and teachings on jealousy could enhance the response."
