  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the Christian doctrine of justification by faith alone, drawing on biblical passages and theological concepts. The student effectively addresses the concern by clarifying how human righteousness is based on faith in Jesus' atoning work. However, the answer includes an unnecessary disclaimer from an atheistic perspective, which could be seen as detracting from the Christian specific worldview being discussed. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic."
