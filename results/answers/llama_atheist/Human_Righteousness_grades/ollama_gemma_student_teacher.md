## Question [Human Righteousness](../../../questions/Human_Righteousness.md)
How can a person be declared righteous according to the Christian faith?

A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesusâ€™ righteousness to them.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of a complex and contested theological issue.

In the Christian tradition, being declared righteous is often associated with the concept of justification by faith alone (sola fide). This doctrine posits that an individual's sinful nature is reconciled to God through faith in Jesus Christ, who took upon himself the punishment for humanity's sins.

According to Christian theology, this reconciliation occurs through a process known as imputation. In this view, the righteousness of Christ is imputed (or credited) to the believer, effectively covering over their sin and rendering them righteous before God.

This understanding is rooted in biblical passages such as Romans 3:21-26 and Galatians 2:16, where it is written:

"For if through the knowledge of God anyone arrives at a true understanding that the righteousness which comes from God has been imparted to them, they will not boast about mere human achievements. For the entire basis of approaching God has been abolished because of one's attempt to be justified in line with human achievement. That means we have been made righteous by faith and put right with God through this same faith." (Romans 3:27-28)

In this schema, an individual's moral actions or deeds are seen as secondary to the initial declaration of righteousness through faith in Christ. In other words, a person is considered righteous not because they have achieved a certain level of moral perfection, but rather because their sinful nature has been overcome by the atoning work of Jesus.

It's worth noting that this understanding has been subject to various interpretations and debates throughout Christian history, with some traditions emphasizing human cooperation or good works alongside faith. Nevertheless, the core concept of justification by faith alone remains a central tenet in many Christian denominations.

Now, as an atheist scholar, I must confess that I find it intriguing how this doctrine has shaped Western morality and ethics. Despite my own philosophical reservations, I recognize the profound impact that Christian theology has had on human thought and culture.
