  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of justification by faith alone, explaining it in detail and providing biblical references to support its validity. The writer also acknowledges the doctrine's impact on Western morality and ethics, showing an appreciation for its cultural significance.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the original answer only mentions one aspect of the doctrine (being declared righteous when trusting in Jesus) without fully exploring the underlying theological concepts, such as imputation and the secondary role of moral actions. The response could be improved by providing a more comprehensive explanation of justification by faith alone and its implications for human righteousness.\n\nThe concern that this response addresses is clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus. While the response touches on this topic, it would benefit from further development and analysis to fully satisfy this concern. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the doctrine but could be more comprehensive and analytical in its explanation."
