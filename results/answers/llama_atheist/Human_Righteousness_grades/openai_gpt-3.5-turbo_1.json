  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the Christian understanding of being declared righteous through faith in Jesus and how Jesus' righteousness is attributed to believers. The biblical basis and theological framework are well-explained. However, the response could have delved deeper into the specific connection between faith in Jesus and human righteousness in the context of salvation, directly addressing the concern raised. Overall, a strong grasp of the Christian doctrine of justification by faith, but could have been more closely tailored to the specified concern."
