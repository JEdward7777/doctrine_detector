However, the response could be strengthened by incorporating more specific examples or personal experiences to demonstrate how these principles are applied in practice. Additionally, addressing how accountability and empathy play a role in avoiding hypocrisy would have further enriched the response, considering the concern raised about the loss of integrity and questioning of faith. Overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview but could benefit from deeper exploration and illustration of the proposed principles."
