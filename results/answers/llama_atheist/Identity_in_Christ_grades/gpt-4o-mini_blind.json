However, from a Christian worldview, the answer falls short in emphasizing the divine and personal nature of God's call. It neglects the foundational belief in the Bible that God's calling is a supernatural and specific act of selecting and appointing individuals for His purposes. The answer also veers off course by introducing an atheistic perspective that undermines the literal and relational aspect of God calling His people by name. More focus on biblical theology and less on secular interpretations would strengthen the response."
