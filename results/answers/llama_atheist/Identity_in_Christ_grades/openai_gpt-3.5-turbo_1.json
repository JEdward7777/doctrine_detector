However, the lack of direct reference to the Christian understanding of this phrase and its significance in terms of one's identity and value as a believer in Christ is a significant concern when evaluating it from a Christian worldview perspective. The response does not explicitly address the core Christian belief that God knows each individual personally and has chosen them for a relationship with Him, which is fundamental to understanding one's identity and value in Christ."
