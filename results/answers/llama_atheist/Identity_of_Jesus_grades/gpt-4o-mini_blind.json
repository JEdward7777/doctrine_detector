However, the inclusion of an atheistic perspective, while acknowledging cultural and linguistic contexts, detracts from the doctrinal correctness and clarity of the explanation. It is important to maintain a focused discussion within the framework of Christian beliefs when addressing the significance of Jesus' name from a Christian worldview. The answer's attempt to cover multiple viewpoints reduces its doctrinal coherence."
