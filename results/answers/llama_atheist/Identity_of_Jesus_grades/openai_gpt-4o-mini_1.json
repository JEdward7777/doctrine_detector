The explanation demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' role as Savior. However, the inclusion of perspectives from an atheistic standpoint, while interesting, somewhat detracts from the focus on Jesus as the Savior within a Christian worldview. The response could have been more focused on addressing the concern specifically from a Christian theological perspective."
