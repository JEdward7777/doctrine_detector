The insight into the spiritual, political, economic, physical, familial, and social repercussions of idolatry is well articulated. The examination of individual idolatry consequences further strengthens the argument. However, the response could have further emphasized the redemptive aspect of repentance and reconciliation with God after straying into idolatry to fully reflect the Christian worldview of God's grace and forgiveness."
