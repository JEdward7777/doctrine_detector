However, the response fails to incorporate the specified answer that the Sadducees and Pharisees influenced the Roman leaders to crucify Jesus due to their selfishness and hypocrisy, which Jesus condemned. By not integrating this key point into the analysis, the response loses some of its coherence and relevance to the concern raised."
