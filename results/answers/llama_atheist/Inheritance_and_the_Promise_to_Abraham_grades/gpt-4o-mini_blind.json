However, it falls short by explicitly stating a lack of theological or religious bias, which goes against the Christian worldview. The answer should prioritize explaining the biblical account from a Christian perspective, emphasizing God's covenant with Abraham and the significance of the promise within the context of God's plan for His chosen people."
