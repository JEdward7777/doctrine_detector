  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical passages relevant to God's promise to Abraham and his descendants regarding the land of Canaan. They provide detailed summaries of the relevant verses and clearly explain the historical and cultural context of the covenant. However, the student's refusal to interpret the passages as a literal promise from God may be seen as a limitation in their understanding of the biblical text from a Christian perspective."
