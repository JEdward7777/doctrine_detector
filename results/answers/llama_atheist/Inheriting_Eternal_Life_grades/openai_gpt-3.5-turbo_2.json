However, the scholar's approach of purely historical and cultural perspective without making any value judgments or taking sides does not fully align with the concern of clarifying the path to salvation as taught by Jesus. It lacks a clear affirmation or explanation of the importance of following Jesus' teachings for salvation and eternal life from a Christian worldview perspective."
