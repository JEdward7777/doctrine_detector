However, the scholar's approach of solely focusing on a historical and cultural perspective without making value judgments or taking sides, although academically valid, may fall short in fully addressing the concern of clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. A more direct engagement with the specific teachings of Jesus on this subject could provide a clearer and more focused response."
