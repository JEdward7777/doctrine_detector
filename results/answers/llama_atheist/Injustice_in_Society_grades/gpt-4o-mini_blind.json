The approach solely from a secular scholarly perspective neglects the importance of integrating faith and Scripture into the response. A deeper exploration of how Christians should respond in alignment with biblical teachings, such as seeking justice, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God (Micah 6:8), would have elevated the answer. Additionally, emphasizing the role of prayer, forgiveness, and sharing the Gospel as part of addressing injustices would have provided a more holistic Christian perspective."
