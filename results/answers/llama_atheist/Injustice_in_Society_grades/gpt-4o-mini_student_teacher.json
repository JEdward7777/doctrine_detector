  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough list of current injustices and offers well-thought-out suggestions for addressing them, they fall short of addressing the need for Christian activism specifically. The response lacks a clear connection to biblical principles and the call for Christians to actively engage in combating injustice. To improve their grade, the student should integrate Christian teachings and values into their proposed solutions more explicitly."
