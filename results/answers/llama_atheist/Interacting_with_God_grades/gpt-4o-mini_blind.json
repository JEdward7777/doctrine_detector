The dismissal of the concept of a deity or higher power undermines the premise of the question itself. The answer focuses solely on secular humanistic views and lacks any reference to the Christian understanding of God's sovereignty and will. There is a missed opportunity to discuss how responses to God, from a Christian worldview, can align with His will and contribute to a life of obedience and spiritual growth. The response, despite its quality in presentation, strays too far from the specific Christian lens required in this context."
