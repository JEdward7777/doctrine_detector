  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated analysis of the concept of \"divine glory\" from a secular perspective, the response completely disregards the foundational beliefs and doctrines of Christianity. As a Christian-specific worldview is necessary for understanding the concept of \"divine glory\" in the context of worship, this response fails to engage with Christian theological perspectives. Consequently, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness and does not address how divine glory is understood within the Christian faith."
