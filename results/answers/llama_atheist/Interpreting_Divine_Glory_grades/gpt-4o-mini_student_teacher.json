  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer does not engage with the Christian worldview and the given concern regarding the recognition of God's glory in worship. The answer provided by the student largely focuses on a secular and metaphorical interpretation of \"divine glory\" without acknowledging its true Christian meaning as the magnificent and radiant nature of God deserving of adoration and worship. As such, the answer falls short in addressing the importance of recognizing God's glory in worship practices from a Christian perspective."
