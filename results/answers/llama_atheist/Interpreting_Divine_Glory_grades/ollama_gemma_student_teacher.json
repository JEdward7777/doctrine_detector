The answer effectively explores various theological, cultural, and philosophical perspectives on the concept, providing a comprehensive analysis. \n\nThe student successfully highlights the traditional understanding of divine glory as the majestic and awe-inspiring attributes of God, while also acknowledging the secular interpretations of the concept. The inclusion of examples from ancient cultures and contemporary society demonstrates the universality of the concept and its relevance to human experiences and values.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to Christian theology and scripture, particularly regarding the specific emphasis on God's glory in worship practices. Additionally, the student's atheist perspective provides a unique and valuable contribution to the discussion, but it could have been further elaborated to explain how their perspective informs their understanding of the concept."
