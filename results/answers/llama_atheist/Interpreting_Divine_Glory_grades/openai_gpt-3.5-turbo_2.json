However, from a Christian worldview, the response falls short in not acknowledging the fundamental belief in a personal, transcendent God whose glory is central to worship practices. While the response offers valuable insights into how different cultures and beliefs perceive divine glory, it misses the Christian perspective that recognizes God's glory as paramount in shaping worship practices and expressions of reverence and awe."
