## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I'd like to approach this question without imposing any theological or supernatural assumptions. Instead, let's examine the cultural and historical context of the term "high" in ancient Near Eastern cultures.

In many ancient societies, including Hebrew and other Semitic languages, the word "high" (Hebrew: גִּבְעוֹלַת, gib'ōlāt) can be understood as a metaphorical expression for supremacy, excellence, or transcendence. In this sense, "Most High" ( Hebrew: יְהוָה הַגִּבְעוֹלִי, YHWH hagib'ōlī) might be interpreted as a way to convey God's absolute authority, uniqueness, or unparalleled greatness.

This interpretation is supported by the broader cultural context. In ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian cultures, gods were often described as "high" or "exalted" (e.g., the Babylonian god Marduk was called "the most high god"), emphasizing their supremacy over other deities and mortals.

In the Hebrew Bible, this concept is echoed in passages like Psalm 91:1-2, which describes God's power and majesty using similar language. The psalmist writes, "Who dwells in the shelter of the Most High / And abides under the shade of the Almighty." Here, "Most High" (Hebrew: יְהוָה הַגִּבְעוֹלִי) likely alludes to God's unparalleled authority and power.

In light of these cultural and historical contexts, we can understand the term "Most High" as a figurative expression for God's supremacy, excellence, or transcendence. This interpretation avoids imposing supernatural assumptions and instead offers a culturally sensitive approach to understanding this phrase in the context of ancient Near Eastern cultures.

What do you think? Would you like to explore further implications of this interpretation or consider alternative perspectives?
