They provide a secular perspective that focuses on human agency, natural explanations, and historical context, but largely neglect the core element of God's faithfulness in the journey of the Israelites to the Promised Land. A Christian worldview would prioritize acknowledging God's role in guiding and providing for His people, which is missing in this response."
