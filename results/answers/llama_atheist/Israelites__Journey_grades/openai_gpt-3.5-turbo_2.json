It lacks any acknowledgment or consideration of the significance of faith, divine intervention, or the Biblical narrative. From a Christian perspective, understanding and recognizing God's faithfulness and sovereignty in the Israelites' journey is essential, and this response fails to engage with that aspect at all."
