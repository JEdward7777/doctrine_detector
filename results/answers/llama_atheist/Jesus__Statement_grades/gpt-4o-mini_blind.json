  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: This answer provides some insightful analysis of the cultural and historical context surrounding Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life.\" The student demonstrates an understanding of the Jewish tradition of resurrection and how it relates to Jesus' proclamation. However, the answer falls short in fully emphasizing the divinity of Jesus and the significance of his statement in terms of His unique role as the Son of God. The answer also leans heavily on a symbolic interpretation, potentially downplaying the literal and miraculous aspects of Jesus' words. Encouraging the student to strengthen their explanation by incorporating more explicit references to Jesus' divine nature and the centrality of His resurrection in Christian theology would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
