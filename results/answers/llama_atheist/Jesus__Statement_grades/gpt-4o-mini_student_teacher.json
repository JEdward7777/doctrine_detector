  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 65.\n\nThe student provides a well-researched and thoughtful response that delves into the cultural and historical context surrounding Jesus' statement. They demonstrate a good understanding of how resurrection was viewed in ancient Jewish tradition and make interesting connections to scripture.\n\nHowever, the student falls short in fully addressing the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection from a Christian worldview. While they touch on Jesus' teachings and authority, and the transformative power of his message, they do not explicitly state that Jesus is the source of resurrection and the one who causes people to come back to life, as per the Christian  specific worldview.\n\nOverall, the student shows a strong grasp of contextual analysis but could strengthen their answer by explicitly tying Jesus' statement to his divine nature and role in the resurrection."
