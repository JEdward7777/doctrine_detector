  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' statement in its historical and cultural context, as well as an effort to unpack its significance for faith and theological understanding. The author provides several insightful observations, such as the connection to apocalyptic language and the echo of God's self-designation in Exodus 3:14-15.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:\n\n1. While the author does acknowledge Jesus' statement as a declaration about his own authority and identity within the Jewish tradition, they do not fully engage with the concern about Jesus' role in resurrection. The response could benefit from a more explicit exploration of how Jesus' claim to be the Resurrection and the Life relates to his overall message and ministry.\n2. Some of the supporting biblical references (e.g., Ezekiel 37:3-14) are not fully integrated into the analysis, which sometimes makes them feel like tacked-on examples rather than integral parts of the argument.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' statement and its significance for faith and theological understanding. With some further development and refinement, it could be even more effective in clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection."
