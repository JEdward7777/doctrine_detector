  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response does a good job of expanding on the original answer by providing cultural and scriptural context to clarify Jesus' identity and role in the statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life.\" It effectively emphasizes the transformative and spiritual aspects of Jesus' message rather than focusing solely on the physical act of resurrection. The analysis aligns well with a Christian worldview by highlighting the divine nature of Jesus and his authority in bringing new life. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong theological understanding while addressing the concern raised."
