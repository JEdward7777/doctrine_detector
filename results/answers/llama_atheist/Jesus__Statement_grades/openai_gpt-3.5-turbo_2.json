  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and thoughtful exploration of Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" within its cultural and theological context. It effectively addresses the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, grounding the interpretation in biblical and historical insights. However, the response could more explicitly emphasize Jesus as the divine source of resurrection in line with Christian beliefs, but overall it presents a well-rounded analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
