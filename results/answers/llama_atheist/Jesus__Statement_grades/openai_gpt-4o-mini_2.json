  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" within its cultural and theological context, emphasizing Jesus' role in bringing new life and restoration. It effectively addresses the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, and offers valuable insights informed by a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more direct scriptural references to support the interpretation presented. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
