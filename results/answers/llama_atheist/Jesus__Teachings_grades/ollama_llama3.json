It provides relevant biblical references and insights into Jewish tradition, which shows recognition of the authority of Scripture. However, it could be improved by more explicitly highlighting Jesus' divine authority and how this is reflected in his use of \"amen\". The response also leaves room for interpretation on the significance of Jesus' teachings, whereas a stronger emphasis on recognizing the authority of Scripture would further strengthen the response.\n\nThe response's concern with recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture is partially addressed through its discussion of Jewish tradition and biblical references. However, it could be more explicitly stated that Jesus' use of \"amen\" reflects his divine authority as revealed in Scripture."
