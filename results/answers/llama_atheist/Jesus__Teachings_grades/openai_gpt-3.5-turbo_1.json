The explanation aligns well with the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' teachings in Scripture. However, there is a missed opportunity to explicitly tie Jesus' divinity to the authority of his words, which is essential in a Christian worldview. A stronger connection between Jesus' divinity and the authority of his teachings would have further enhanced the response."
