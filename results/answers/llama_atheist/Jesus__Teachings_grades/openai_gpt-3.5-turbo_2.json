  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of how Jesus used the term \"amen\" in his teachings, drawing upon historical and linguistic contexts. The student correctly explains that Jesus used \"amen\" to emphasize the truth of his teachings, which aligns with the given answer. However, the response falls short in explicitly recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. It is essential in a Christian worldview to acknowledge that Jesus' teachings are not merely human opinions but divine revelations, and this aspect could have been highlighted more strongly in the response."
