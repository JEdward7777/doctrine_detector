The writer effectively connects Jesus' use of \"amen\" to the Jewish tradition and provides insightful explanations for its implications in Jesus' teachings. The response could have further emphasized the unique authority of Jesus as the Son of God, specifically in relation to Scripture, to more fully address the concern raised from a Christian worldview perspective."
