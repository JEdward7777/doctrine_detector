  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough exploration of Jesus' relationship to the priesthood in Jewish and Christian traditions, citing relevant scriptures and explaining the implications for human priests. However, the response could have been more focused on the central point that Jesus is the ultimate High Priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice, rendering human sacrifices unnecessary. The student's answer, while informative, could have more directly addressed the significance of Jesus' role in negating the need for further sacrifices by human priests."
