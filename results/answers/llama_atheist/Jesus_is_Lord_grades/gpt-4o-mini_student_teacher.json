However, the student's response could have been improved by directly stating the fundamental distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. It is important for the student to explicitly address the concern raised regarding the need for clarity in differentiating Jesus' divine authority from earthly titles when communicating the phrase \"Jesus is Lord.\""
