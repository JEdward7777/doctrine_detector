  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and well-developed approach to addressing the concern of clarifying the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The suggestions given are clear, practical, and respectful of the Christian worldview, emphasizing the importance of accurately conveying the unique nature of Jesus' lordship. The only minor critique is that the response could further emphasize the divine and redemptive aspects of Jesus' lordship to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
