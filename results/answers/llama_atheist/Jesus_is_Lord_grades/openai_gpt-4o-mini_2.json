The suggestions for explaining the meaning, using analogies, highlighting the distinction, focusing on Jesus' character, encouraging deeper understanding, and avoiding cultural appropriation are all helpful in ensuring a clear and accurate communication of the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" within a cultural context where political leaders hold similar titles."
