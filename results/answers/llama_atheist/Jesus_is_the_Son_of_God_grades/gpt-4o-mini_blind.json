The suggested translations and equivalencies do not capture the essential truth of Jesus being the Son of God in a Muslim context. From a Christian perspective, it is crucial to convey this central tenet of the faith with fidelity, even when engaging in interfaith dialogue. Additionally, the answer could have included a brief explanation of the theological significance of Jesus as the Son of God within Christianity."
