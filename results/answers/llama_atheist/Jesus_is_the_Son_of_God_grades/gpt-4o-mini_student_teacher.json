  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer is well-researched and sensitive to cultural differences, which is commendable. However, the answer strays from the specified concern by avoiding the direct translation of \"Jesus is the Son of God\" and instead provides alternative phrases that may not accurately convey the full theological significance of the original statement. While cultural sensitivity is important, the answer falls short of maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context as requested. In a Christian worldview, it is essential to prioritize Biblical accuracy and clarity in conveying the meaning of the original text."
