  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological and cultural sensitivities involved in translating religious concepts between different belief systems. The approach is nuanced, respectful, and avoids imposing Western theological constructs onto Islamic beliefs.\n\nThe student provides several possible translations that are both accurate and culturally appropriate within the Muslim context. They also highlight the importance of prioritizing cultural sensitivity and fostering respectful dialogue when engaging with Muslim interlocutors.\n\nWhile the student adheres to the teacher's instructions of maintaining the original terminology, they could benefit from providing more explicit explanation of the biblical basis for the statement \"Jesus is the Son of God.\" This would strengthen the theological accuracy of the translation.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a thoughtful and responsible approach to cross-cultural communication and understanding."
