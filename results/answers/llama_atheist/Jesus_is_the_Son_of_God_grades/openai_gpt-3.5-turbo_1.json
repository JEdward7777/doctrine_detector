However, it falls short of maintaining Biblical accuracy and explaining the original text in the most appropriate way, as required by a Christian worldview. The translations provided do not accurately convey the core theological significance of Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity. It is important to prioritize the fidelity of biblical teachings even while seeking to be culturally sensitive."
