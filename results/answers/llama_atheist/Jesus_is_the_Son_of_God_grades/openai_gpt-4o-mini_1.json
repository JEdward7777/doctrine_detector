While it attempts to be culturally sensitive and respectful towards Islamic beliefs, it ultimately compromises the integrity of the Christian belief that Jesus is the Son of God. Christians believe this to be a foundational truth, not open to reinterpretation or equivalence in other faith traditions. The response should have upheld the Christian perspective more firmly while still engaging in respectful dialogue with other religious traditions."
