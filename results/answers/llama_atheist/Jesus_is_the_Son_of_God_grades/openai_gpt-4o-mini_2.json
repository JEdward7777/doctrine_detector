As a Christian, it is essential to maintain the integrity of biblical teachings, including the concept of Jesus as the Son of God, and provide clear explanations of this belief. The response does not prioritize ensuring that the translated text is Biblically accurate and may lead to misconceptions about Christian beliefs. It is important to convey the truth with clarity and conviction, even while engaging in interfaith dialogue."
