However, the approach of presenting the information as a neutral and non-judgmental scholar contradicts the Christian worldview, which holds that the Bible is the ultimate authority and source of truth. The emphasis on cultural context over moral judgments may lead to a misunderstanding of the importance of upholding biblical principles in Christian relationships. Additionally, the concept of individual spiritual growth and refraining from being judgmental should be presented within the broader Christian context of accountability, repentance, and restoration in a community of believers."
