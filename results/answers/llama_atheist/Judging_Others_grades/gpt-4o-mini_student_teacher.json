  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that covers various aspects of how Christians should interact with each other based on biblical guidance. They correctly highlighted the importance of love, compassion, humility, honesty, forgiveness, and personal spiritual growth. However, the student could have improved their answer by focusing more directly on the specific biblical instruction of not judging others harshly or condemning them, as stated in the teacher's reference answer. Integrating this central biblical principle more prominently would have strengthened the response."
