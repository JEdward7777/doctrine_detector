The incorporation of relevant Bible passages and practical recommendations for conflict resolution align well with the concern presented. The only area for improvement could be to more explicitly connect each point back to the central theme of approaching relationships in a Christ-like manner, but overall, the response is thoughtful and reflective of a Christian worldview."
