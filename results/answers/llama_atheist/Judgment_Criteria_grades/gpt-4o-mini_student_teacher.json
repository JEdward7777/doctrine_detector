  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the biblical perspective on the Day of Judgment, highlighting key passages and themes related to judgment based on treatment of others, heart attitude, and faithfulness. However, the student's repeated emphasis on being an atheist and disbelief in the concept of divine judgment detracts from a fully Christian worldview perspective. A stronger integration of the Christian belief in divine judgment and the significance of aligning one's life with the character of Christ would have improved the answer."
