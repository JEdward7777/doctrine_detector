  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the biblical perspective on judgment, citing relevant passages from Matthew and Revelation. It also highlights the importance of treatment of others, heart attitude, and faithfulness in understanding how individuals will be judged. However, it does not directly address the concern of alignment with biblical principles or explicitly state that individuals will be judged based on their actions and lives in relation to the righteous character of Christ. While the response acknowledges the cultural significance of the concept of judgment, it does not provide a clear connection between this idea and the Christian perspective."
