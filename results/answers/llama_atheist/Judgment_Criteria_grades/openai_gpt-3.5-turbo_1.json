  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed analysis of the biblical perspective on the Day of Judgment, considering key passages and themes related to judgment based on actions, heart attitude, and faithfulness. However, the grade is lower as the analysis lacks integration with the given Christian-specific worldview focus, which emphasizes judgment in relation to the righteous character of Christ. The response does not clearly address the concern provided, as it remains predominantly focused on biblical descriptions of judgment rather than aligning actions with the principles of Christ's righteousness. An effort to connect the analysis more explicitly to the need for Christians to align their actions with biblical principles would have improved the grade."
