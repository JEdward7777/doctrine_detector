  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided thoughtful suggestions for rephrasing \"Kingdom of God\" in cultures without a concept of kingdoms. However, as a Christian worldview emphasizes doctrinal correctness, some of the proposed solutions may dilute the specific theological nuances associated with the term \"Kingdom of God.\" While cultural sensitivity is important, maintaining the integrity of Christian teachings should be prioritized. The student's response would benefit from a stronger emphasis on finding culturally appropriate translations that faithfully convey the biblical concept of the Kingdom of God."
