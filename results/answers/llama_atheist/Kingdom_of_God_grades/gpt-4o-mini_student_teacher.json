  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful considerations and potential approaches to rephrasing \"Kingdom of God\" for cultures without a concept of kingdoms, which shows an attempt to address the concern raised. However, the teacher's specific worldview perspective was not incorporated into the response. The student focused on cultural sensitivity and linguistic adaptation but fell short of emphasizing the spiritual and eschatological significance of the term as guided by a Christian worldview."
