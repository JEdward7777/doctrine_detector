  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides a thoughtful and nuanced approach to translating \"Kingdom of God\" into cultures without a concept of kingdoms. It acknowledges the importance of retaining the depth and biblical context of the term, while also considering the need for cultural recontextualization. The suggestions presented (avoid direct translation, use analogies and metaphors, focus on the message rather than the metaphor, and consider the cultural context) demonstrate an understanding of the concern that repurposing could lose the richness of the original term.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the response doesn't directly address the concern about rephrasing losing depth and biblical context. While the suggestions do take this into account, the language used is still somewhat abstract, and one might want to see more explicit recognition of the importance of retaining the original term's meaning.\n\nOverall, however, this is a thoughtful and well-reasoned response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concern and provides some excellent suggestions for addressing it."
