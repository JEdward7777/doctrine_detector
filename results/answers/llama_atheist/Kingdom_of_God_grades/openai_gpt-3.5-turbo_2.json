  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response provides thoughtful suggestions for translating the concept of \"Kingdom of God\" into cultures without a concept of kingdoms, it ultimately strays from the specified answer of retaining the term and explaining its spiritual and eschatological significance. The concern about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term 'Kingdom of God' is not directly addressed in the response, hence the lower grade."
