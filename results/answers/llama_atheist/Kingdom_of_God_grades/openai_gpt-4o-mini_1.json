  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response, while well thought out and respectful of diverse cultures, deviates significantly from the recommended approach of retaining the term \"Kingdom of God\" and explaining its spiritual and eschatological significance. The suggested rephrasing and use of alternative terms could indeed risk diluting the biblical context and depth of the term. The response focuses more on adapting the concept for different cultures rather than upholding the importance of the original term in Christian theology."
