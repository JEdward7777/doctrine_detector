## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist scholar, I approach this question with a critical and secular perspective. While the concept of "heaven" may not have a concrete basis in reality, the term itself holds significant cultural and historical importance.

In the context of the Gospel of Matthew, the phrase "kingdom of heaven" (Greek: βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν, basileia tōn ouranōn) is used to convey the message of Jesus' teachings and the establishment of his spiritual realm. The term "heaven" in this context likely referred to the transcendent realm or the divine sphere, rather than a physical location.

Retaining the term "heaven" in the phrase "kingdom of heaven" may have been important for several reasons:

1. Cultural and literary significance: In ancient Jewish literature, including apocalyptic texts like Daniel and Enoch, "heaven" was often used to describe the divine realm or the abode of God. By using this term, Matthew's author (traditionally attributed to Matthew himself) may have been drawing on these cultural and literary traditions to convey the significance of Jesus' message.
2. Distinction from earthly kingdoms: The use of "heaven" instead of "kingdom of earth" or a similar phrase may have emphasized the otherworldly nature of Jesus' teachings, distinguishing his message from those of secular leaders and earthly powers. This distinction would have been crucial for early Christian communities seeking to establish their own identity apart from the dominant Roman Empire.
3. Symbolic resonance: The term "heaven" likely carried symbolic connotations that were meaningful to the original audience. For example, heaven was often associated with purity, holiness, and divine presence, making it an apt metaphor for Jesus' message of spiritual transformation and redemption.

In conclusion, while the concept of "heaven" may not have a direct bearing on our understanding of reality, its cultural and symbolic significance in ancient Jewish literature and Christian theology makes it important to retain the term "heaven" in the phrase "kingdom of heaven." This retention allows us to better grasp the historical and literary context in which Jesus' teachings were first presented.
