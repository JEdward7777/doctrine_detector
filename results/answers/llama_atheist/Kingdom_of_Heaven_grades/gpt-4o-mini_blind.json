  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provides a detailed analysis of why it is important to retain the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the book of Matthew from a secular perspective. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer falls short in acknowledging the theological significance of 'heaven' as a real and eternal dwelling place prepared by God for believers. The explanation lacks a recognition of the biblical teachings about the kingdom of heaven being a literal, spiritual realm ruled by God. Additionally, the response does not address the doctrinal implications of heaven as a foundational belief in Christianity. A more thorough evaluation incorporating these theological aspects would improve the grade."
