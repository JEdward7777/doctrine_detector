  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough analysis of the cultural, literary, and symbolic significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" in the Gospel of Matthew. They demonstrate a good understanding of the context and potential reasons behind the usage of this term. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the specific theological implications regarding God's reign as stated in the reference answer. Additionally, as an atheist scholar, the student's perspective on the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" does not align with a Christian worldview, which would place more emphasis on the theological implications of such terminology. Further exploration of the theological implications from a Christian perspective would enhance the overall response."
