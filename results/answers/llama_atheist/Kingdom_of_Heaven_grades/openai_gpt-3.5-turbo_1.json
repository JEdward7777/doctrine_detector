  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively engages with the concern by providing a detailed exploration of the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" within the context of Matthew's gospel. The analysis demonstrates a strong understanding of how unique theological terminology can enhance our understanding of biblical messages. However, as the response is from an atheist perspective and does not consider the theological implications of God's reign or the Christian worldview, the grade is slightly lower than it would be for a response that fully incorporates a Christian-specific perspective."
