  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concern provided, offering a detailed analysis of the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven\" within the specific theological context of the Gospel of Matthew. The analysis effectively connects the unique terminology used in the gospels to the intended messages of the biblical authors, showcasing a deep appreciation for the cultural and symbolic nuances at play. The response could benefit from a slightly stronger emphasis on how this unique terminology aligns with Christian beliefs and teachings, but overall, it presents a strong argument from a scholarly, critical, and secular perspective."
