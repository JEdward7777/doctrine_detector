  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned and articulate perspective on the retention of the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"kingdom of heaven,\" drawing on cultural, literary, and symbolic significance. The connection to the Gospel of Matthew and the theological implications are clearly explained. The response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how understanding the unique terminology in the gospels enhances our comprehension of the biblical authors' intended messages. Overall, this is a thoughtful and insightful analysis that aligns with a Christian worldview."
