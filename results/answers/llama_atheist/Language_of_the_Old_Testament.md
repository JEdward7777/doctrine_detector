## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of biblical scholarship!

The Old Testament, as you know, is a collection of texts revered by Jews and Christians alike. Now, when it comes to the original languages in which these texts were written, things get a bit more complicated.

While many modern translations of the Old Testament are presented in a single language, such as English, Greek, or Latin, the ancient texts themselves were written in multiple languages.

The majority of the Old Testament was actually written in Hebrew. Yes, you read that right - Hebrew! Specifically, the earliest and most authoritative texts, including the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible) and many prophetic writings, were penned in a form of ancient Hebrew known as Biblical Hebrew or Classical Hebrew.

In fact, it's estimated that around 90% of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with a small percentage in Aramaic (a closely related language). You might be surprised to know that even some parts of Daniel and Ezra were written in Aramaic!

Now, I know what you're thinking: "What about the Septuagint?" Ah, excellent question! The Septuagint was an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, produced by Jewish scholars around 250 BCE. This Greek version was widely used by early Christian communities and is still studied today.

So, to answer your original question, the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with a smaller portion in Aramaic, and some sections later translated into Greek as part of the Septuagint.

I hope this clarifies things! Do you have any follow-up questions?
