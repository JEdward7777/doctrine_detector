  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed answer that accurately identifies Hebrew as the language in which the vast majority of the Old Testament was written. They also touched upon the presence of Aramaic in some sections and the relevance of the Septuagint. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and effectively addresses the concern of understanding the original context of the Scriptures. Well done!"
