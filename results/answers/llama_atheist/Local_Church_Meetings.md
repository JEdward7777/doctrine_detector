## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I don't have personal beliefs or biases towards any particular religion or denomination. However, as a scholar, I can provide you with information based on historical records and scholarly research.

According to the Christian scriptures and historical accounts, early Christians in many cities, including Jerusalem, Antioch, and Corinth, typically met in homes or private residences for communal gatherings, worship, and fellowship (Acts 2:46, 8:3; 1 Corinthians 16:19). These home meetings were often referred to as "house churches" or "home fellowships."

In these early Christian communities, believers would gather to:

1. Share meals together, which was a common practice in ancient Mediterranean cultures.
2. Worship and celebrate the Lord's Supper (Communion) in remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice.
3. Engage in prayer, singing, and Scripture reading.
4. Share spiritual gifts, such as prophesying, healing, and preaching.
5. Provide mutual support, care, and encouragement to one another.

These home meetings were often led by a host or elder who facilitated the gathering, and attendees would take turns sharing their experiences, insights, and concerns. As the Christian community grew and spread throughout the Mediterranean world, these informal gatherings eventually gave rise to larger, more formalized churches and institutions.

It's worth noting that this is based on historical records and scholarly research, rather than personal beliefs or biases.
