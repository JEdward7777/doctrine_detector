  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 70. While the student provides a detailed and accurate description of how believers typically met in early Christian communities, they did not specifically address the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers. The focus on historical records and scholarly research is commendable, but from a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the importance of believers coming together for encouragement, support, and mutual spiritual growth. Encouraging local fellowship among believers is a key aspect of Christian community and should have been highlighted more explicitly in the response."
