  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and accurate description of early Christian gatherings, which aligns well with the concern to foster local fellowship among believers. The text also provides historical context and cites relevant biblical passages, which adds credibility and depth to the information presented. While there is room for improvement in terms of explicit encouragement to foster local fellowship, the response effectively conveys the importance of community and connection among believers.\n\nThe only deduction from a perfect score comes from the fact that the initial sentence could be strengthened by explicitly linking the concept of \"home meetings\" to the concern of fostering local fellowship. Additionally, a few more concrete examples or applications of this principle in modern-day contexts might further enhance the response's effectiveness in addressing the concern."
