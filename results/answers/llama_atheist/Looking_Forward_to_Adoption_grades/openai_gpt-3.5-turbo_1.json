The response aptly discussed the believer's anticipation for their full adoption as God's children in the future, but could have further emphasized the spiritual transformation and inheritance aspect of being adopted into God's family. A stronger connection to the redemptive work of Christ and the believer's new identity in Him would have enhanced the Christian worldview perspective on this matter."
