  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the historical and symbolic significance of the Lord's Supper within Christianity. The analysis is well-researched and clearly articulates the connection between the Last Supper and the Eucharist. \n\nWhile the student's perspective as an atheist scholar adds an additional layer of analysis, it may not be relevant to the Christian-specific worldview specified in the concern. Nonetheless, the overall clarity and depth of the response justify a high grade."
