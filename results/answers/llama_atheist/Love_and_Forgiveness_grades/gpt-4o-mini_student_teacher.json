  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-researched analysis of forgiveness in the biblical context from a historical and cultural perspective, they failed to address the concern of encouraging the practice of forgiveness as a reflection of God's love in daily interactions. The student's answer remained at a scholarly level rather than emphasizing the importance of forgiveness as a reflection of God's love and its practical application in daily interactions. From a Christian worldview, the focus should be on how forgiveness demonstrates God's love and should be practiced in love towards others, not solely on the historical and cultural context."
