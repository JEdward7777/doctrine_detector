However, as requested, the answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview. The student, despite claiming to be an atheist, should have researched and presented the Christian perspective more accurately, without inserting personal biases or non-Christian viewpoints. The response somewhat conflates broader cultural values with Christian teachings, which lowers the doctrinal correctness of the answer. Additionally, the emphasis on broader cultural values could potentially dilute the distinctiveness of Christian marriage beliefs. Effort was made to incorporate relevant biblical references, but a more in-depth exploration of Christian marriage theology would enhance the response."
