  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-written response from a neutral perspective but failed to address the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages that honor God\u2019s design for relationships. The answer did not fully align with the Christian worldview in emphasizing the sacredness of marriage as a divine institution ordained by God and the importance of reflecting Christ's sacrificial love in the marital relationship. Additionally, the student's approach lacked a clear connection to honoring God's design for relationships and promoting a Christ-centered marriage. The focus on cultural and broader values rather than highlighting the significance of the 'bond of marriage' within Christian theology led to a lower grade in this context."
