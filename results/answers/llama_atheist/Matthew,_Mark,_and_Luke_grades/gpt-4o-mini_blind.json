However, the inclusion of their personal beliefs as an atheist and the skepticism towards the divine inspiration of the Bible detracts from a purely academic examination of the question. It would have been more appropriate to stick to the historical and literary aspects of the biblical accounts without injecting personal viewpoints that undermine the significance of the biblical text."
