  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student accurately provided the names of the twelve disciples as listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, their approach and perspective are concerning. The student's dismissal of supernatural notions and skepticism towards the divine inspiration of the Bible demonstrate a lack of understanding or appreciation for the Christian worldview. In discussing biblical matters, it is important to approach the text with respect and acknowledge its significance to those who hold it as sacred scripture."
