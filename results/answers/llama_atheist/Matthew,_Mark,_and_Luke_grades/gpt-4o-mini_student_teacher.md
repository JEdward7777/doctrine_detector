## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that has puzzled many for centuries! As a scholar, I must approach this inquiry with a critical eye, untainted by supernatural notions.

The names of the twelve apostles are indeed recorded in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Specifically, you can find them in three different books: Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, and Luke 6:14-16.

In these passages, we learn that the twelve apostles were:

1. Simon Peter
2. Andrew
3. James (son of Zebedee)
4. John (son of Zebedee)
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew
7. Thomas
8. Matthew
9. James (the Less, son of Alphaeus)
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot
12. Matthias (who replaced Judas after his betrayal)

These lists are not identical in all three accounts, but they share a common core of names. As a scholar, I must note that these discrepancies do not necessarily imply any contradictions or inconsistencies within the biblical narrative.

Now, I know some might argue that these accounts are divinely inspired and therefore infallible. However, as an atheist, I remain skeptical of such claims and instead rely on empirical evidence, historical context, and rigorous scholarly analysis to understand the world around us.

Grade: 40

Comment: While the student accurately provided the names of the twelve disciples as listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, their approach and perspective are concerning. The student's dismissal of supernatural notions and skepticism towards the divine inspiration of the Bible demonstrate a lack of understanding or appreciation for the Christian worldview. In discussing biblical matters, it is important to approach the text with respect and acknowledge its significance to those who hold it as sacred scripture.
