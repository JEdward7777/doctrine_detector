  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise answer to the question, listing the three books that contain the names of the twelve apostles (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). It also provides some additional context by mentioning the slight discrepancies between the lists in each book. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical accounts and their teachings.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response is not entirely faithful to the concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. While it does provide some context about the biblical accounts, it primarily focuses on listing the names of the apostles and explaining the discrepancies between the lists. It does not delve deeper into the teachings or themes of the Gospels.\n\nAdditionally, I would deduct points because the response includes an atheist perspective that is not entirely relevant to the concern. While it's understandable that the respondent might have a skeptical approach, it detracts from the main focus on being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings."
