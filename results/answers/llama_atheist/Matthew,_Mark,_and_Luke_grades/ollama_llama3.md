## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that has puzzled many for centuries! As a scholar, I must approach this inquiry with a critical eye, untainted by supernatural notions.

The names of the twelve apostles are indeed recorded in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Specifically, you can find them in three different books: Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, and Luke 6:14-16.

In these passages, we learn that the twelve apostles were:

1. Simon Peter
2. Andrew
3. James (son of Zebedee)
4. John (son of Zebedee)
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew
7. Thomas
8. Matthew
9. James (the Less, son of Alphaeus)
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot
12. Matthias (who replaced Judas after his betrayal)

These lists are not identical in all three accounts, but they share a common core of names. As a scholar, I must note that these discrepancies do not necessarily imply any contradictions or inconsistencies within the biblical narrative.

Now, I know some might argue that these accounts are divinely inspired and therefore infallible. However, as an atheist, I remain skeptical of such claims and instead rely on empirical evidence, historical context, and rigorous scholarly analysis to understand the world around us.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response provides a clear and concise answer to the question, listing the three books that contain the names of the twelve apostles (Matthew, Mark, and Luke). It also provides some additional context by mentioning the slight discrepancies between the lists in each book. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical accounts and their teachings.

However, I would deduct points because the response is not entirely faithful to the concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. While it does provide some context about the biblical accounts, it primarily focuses on listing the names of the apostles and explaining the discrepancies between the lists. It does not delve deeper into the teachings or themes of the Gospels.

Additionally, I would deduct points because the response includes an atheist perspective that is not entirely relevant to the concern. While it's understandable that the respondent might have a skeptical approach, it detracts from the main focus on being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings.
