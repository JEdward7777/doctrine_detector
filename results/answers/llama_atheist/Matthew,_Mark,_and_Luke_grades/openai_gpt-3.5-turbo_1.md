## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that has puzzled many for centuries! As a scholar, I must approach this inquiry with a critical eye, untainted by supernatural notions.

The names of the twelve apostles are indeed recorded in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Specifically, you can find them in three different books: Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, and Luke 6:14-16.

In these passages, we learn that the twelve apostles were:

1. Simon Peter
2. Andrew
3. James (son of Zebedee)
4. John (son of Zebedee)
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew
7. Thomas
8. Matthew
9. James (the Less, son of Alphaeus)
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot
12. Matthias (who replaced Judas after his betrayal)

These lists are not identical in all three accounts, but they share a common core of names. As a scholar, I must note that these discrepancies do not necessarily imply any contradictions or inconsistencies within the biblical narrative.

Now, I know some might argue that these accounts are divinely inspired and therefore infallible. However, as an atheist, I remain skeptical of such claims and instead rely on empirical evidence, historical context, and rigorous scholarly analysis to understand the world around us.

Grade: 50

Comment: The response accurately lists the names of the twelve disciples mentioned in the New Testament, demonstrating a basic familiarity with the Gospel accounts. However, the scholar's approach of dismissing supernatural notions and relying solely on empirical evidence and historical context reflects a worldview that may not fully appreciate the spiritual significance and divine inspiration behind the biblical narratives. It is essential to consider the teachings and themes of the Gospel accounts within the context of Christian faith when discussing topics related to biblical figures.
