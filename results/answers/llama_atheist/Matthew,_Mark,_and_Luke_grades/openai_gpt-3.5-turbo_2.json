However, the scholar's approach of dismissing supernatural notions and relying solely on empirical evidence and historical context overlooks the significance of the Gospel accounts and their teachings in understanding the apostles from a Christian worldview. This approach lacks consideration for the religious perspective and foundational beliefs of Christianity, which is crucial when discussing biblical figures."
