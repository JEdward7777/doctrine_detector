## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that has puzzled many for centuries! As a scholar, I must approach this inquiry with a critical eye, untainted by supernatural notions.

The names of the twelve apostles are indeed recorded in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. Specifically, you can find them in three different books: Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, and Luke 6:14-16.

In these passages, we learn that the twelve apostles were:

1. Simon Peter
2. Andrew
3. James (son of Zebedee)
4. John (son of Zebedee)
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew
7. Thomas
8. Matthew
9. James (the Less, son of Alphaeus)
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot
12. Matthias (who replaced Judas after his betrayal)

These lists are not identical in all three accounts, but they share a common core of names. As a scholar, I must note that these discrepancies do not necessarily imply any contradictions or inconsistencies within the biblical narrative.

Now, I know some might argue that these accounts are divinely inspired and therefore infallible. However, as an atheist, I remain skeptical of such claims and instead rely on empirical evidence, historical context, and rigorous scholarly analysis to understand the world around us.

Grade: 50

Comment: The response provides accurate information about the names of the twelve apostles as listed in the New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. However, the scholar's approach of dismissing supernatural notions and relying solely on empirical evidence and historical context overlooks the significance of the Gospel accounts and their teachings in understanding the apostles from a Christian worldview. This approach lacks consideration for the religious perspective and foundational beliefs of Christianity, which is crucial when discussing biblical figures.
