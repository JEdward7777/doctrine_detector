The response dismisses any spiritual significance or divine inspiration behind the biblical narrative, which is a critical aspect when discussing topics related to Christianity. A Christian-specific worldview would prioritize understanding the Gospel accounts as spiritually inspired texts, rather than solely relying on empirical evidence and historical context."
