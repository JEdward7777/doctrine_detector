  "grade": 25.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed explanation of what it means to \"minister\" to others according to the Bible from a secular perspective. However, the answer fundamentally lacks the key foundational belief in the supernatural and divine nature of the Bible, which is essential to understanding and interpreting the concept of ministry within a Christian worldview. The student's explanation reflects a secular humanistic approach to service rather than a biblically grounded understanding of ministry. Significant theological inaccuracies and omissions lower the grade in this context."
