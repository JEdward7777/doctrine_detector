However, there is a deviation in the worldview and belief regarding the supernatural or divine nature of the Bible, which may impact the depth of insight and application of the biblical concept of ministry. The understanding of ministry as serving others, caring for their needs, and teaching them about God is correctly outlined, but lacking the spiritual perspective that is integral to Christian ministry. It is important to consider the spiritual dimension when discussing biblical concepts, especially when emphasizing the significance of ministry in the church and community from a Christian worldview."
