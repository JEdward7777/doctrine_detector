  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of ministry from both a biblical and secular perspective. While the perspective of an atheist is acknowledged, the focus remains on the biblical definition of ministry as serving others in the context of teaching about God and caring for their needs. The importance of understanding this biblical definition for effective service in the church and community is recognized throughout the response. However, the lack of a direct acknowledgment of the supernatural or divine aspects of ministry in a Christian worldview context leads to a lower grade."
