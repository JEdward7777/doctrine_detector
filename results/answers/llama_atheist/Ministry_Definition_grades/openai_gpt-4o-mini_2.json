The perspective presented diverged significantly from the Christian understanding of ministry as rooted in faith, serving God, and sharing the message of salvation through Jesus Christ. Focusing on the humanitarian aspect of ministry without acknowledging its spiritual significance may not effectively address the concern of understanding the biblical definition of ministry within a Christian context."
