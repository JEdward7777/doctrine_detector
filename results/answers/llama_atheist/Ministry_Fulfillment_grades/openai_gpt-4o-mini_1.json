It dismisses the concept of a divine mandate or God-given purpose, which is a foundational belief in Christianity. The response focuses solely on secular and cultural perspectives, neglecting the importance of understanding and executing one's God-given purpose in serving others. From a Christian perspective, fulfilling one's ministry goes beyond personal fulfillment and making a positive impact but involves obedience to God's calling and serving others in accordance with His will."
