  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-structured and articulate response that acknowledges the cultural and historical significance of miracles in various religious traditions. The student effectively discusses how miracles challenge our understanding of the natural world and convey symbolic messages about divine involvement. However, from a Christian worldview, the student misses the crucial point that miracles serve as indicators of God's power specifically to prompt belief in Him and validate the ministry of prophets and apostles. While the student's analysis is insightful, a stronger connection to the reference answer's focus on miracles as indicators of God's power and agents of belief would have improved the response."
