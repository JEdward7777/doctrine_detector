  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the cultural and historical significance of miracles in various religious traditions, which demonstrates an understanding of their role in leading others to faith. However, it does not explicitly connect the concept of miracles to God's power or validating the ministry of prophets and apostles, as stated in the given answer. Additionally, while the response recognizes the symbolic significance of miracles, it does not specifically highlight how these events prompt belief in God or validate prophetic ministries.\n\nThe concern about understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith is somewhat addressed through the analysis of miracles' functions (extraordinary events, divine involvement, symbolic significance, and community tradition). However, the response could be strengthened by more directly exploring how miracles can be used as a means of evangelism and personal faith. Overall, the response demonstrates some understanding of the topic, but could benefit from more explicit connections to the given answer and concern."
