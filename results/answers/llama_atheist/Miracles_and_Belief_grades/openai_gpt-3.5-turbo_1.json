It provides a well-structured analysis of how miracles function as signs of God's power and divine intervention, aligning with the specified concern. However, the response falls short in fully embracing a Christian-specific worldview, as it approaches the topic from an atheist perspective, which may not fully capture the depth of the Christian belief in miracles as manifestations of God's grace and power."
