  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and well-reasoned perspective on the role of miracles in leading others to faith, acknowledging the significance of miracles in various religious traditions. The candidate effectively integrates a critical and secular viewpoint with an understanding of the cultural and historical importance of miracles. However, from a Christian specific worldview, there could be a stronger emphasis on the direct connection between miracles and God's power as a means of validating His existence and prompting belief in Him. Also, highlighting the transformative nature of personal faith through witnessing miracles could further strengthen the response."
