Their interpretation focused solely on secular and cultural contexts, neglecting the religious symbolism and significance of myrrh in relation to Jesus as the Messiah and his ultimate sacrifice for humanity. In a Christian-specific worldview, understanding the spiritual meaning behind the gifts presented to Jesus is essential. The response would benefit from integrating the religious aspects of myrrh's symbolism in the Christian faith."
