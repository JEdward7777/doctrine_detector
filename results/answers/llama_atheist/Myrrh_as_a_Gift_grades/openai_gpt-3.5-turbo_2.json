While the answer does not directly address the concern about understanding the symbolism of the gifts given to Jesus deepening appreciation of his purpose and mission, it offers valuable insights from a historical and cultural perspective. However, from a Christian worldview, the emphasis on myrrh solely as a cultural and symbolic element, without delving into its profound significance in foreshadowing Jesus' future suffering and sacrifice for humanity's sins, diminishes the complete understanding of the gift's symbolism. Integrating the Christian perspective of myrrh representing Jesus' future suffering and death as the Messiah would strengthen the response in addressing the concern raised."
