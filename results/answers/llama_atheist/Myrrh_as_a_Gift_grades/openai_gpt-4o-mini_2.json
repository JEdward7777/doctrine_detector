However, it falls short of fully addressing the concern by not explicitly acknowledging the Christian belief that myrrh also symbolizes Jesus' future suffering and death as the Messiah. Integrating this aspect would have enhanced the response's alignment with a Christian worldview and deepened the understanding of Jesus' purpose and mission."
