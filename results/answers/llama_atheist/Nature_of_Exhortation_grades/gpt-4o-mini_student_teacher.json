  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer on how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament. However, the primary concern of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner was not directly addressed in the response. While the student touched on empathy and compassion in exhortation, the emphasis on exhorting in love as the reference answer suggested was not clearly highlighted. The student's answer demonstrated a good understanding of biblical principles related to exhortation but lacked a direct connection to the specific concern outlined in the grading framework."
