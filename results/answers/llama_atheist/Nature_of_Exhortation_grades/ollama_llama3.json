  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian exhortation in the New Testament context, addressing the concern of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner. The writer provides biblical examples and principles for effective exhortation, emphasizing the importance of grounding it in Scripture, demonstrating empathy and understanding, humility and authenticity, focus on Jesus Christ, and dependence on the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe response effectively builds upon the original answer (\"Christians should exhort each other in love, not harshly or abruptly.\") by providing a more comprehensive understanding of what this looks like in practice. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect the biblical principles discussed to the original concern about delivering encouragement in a loving and supportive manner. Nevertheless, the response is well-structured, biblically grounded, and demonstrates a thoughtful approach to Christian exhortation."
