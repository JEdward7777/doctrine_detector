  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive exploration of Christian exhortation based on the New Testament, emphasizing the importance of encouragement being rooted in Scripture, empathetic, humble, focused on Jesus Christ, and dependent on the Holy Spirit. The principles outlined align well with the concern of ensuring that encouragement is delivered in a loving and supportive manner. The only point for improvement would be to directly address the concern by explicitly linking the principles discussed to the idea of exhorting in love, which is the essence of Christian encouragement."
