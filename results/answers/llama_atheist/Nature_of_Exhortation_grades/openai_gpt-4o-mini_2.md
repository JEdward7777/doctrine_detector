## [Answer](../Nature_of_Exhortation.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of Christian praxis!

As an atheist, I must admit that my perspective might be a bit...unorthodox. Nevertheless, I'll do my best to provide an answer informed by the New Testament.

In the New Testament, exhortation is often associated with the concept of "encouragement" (parakaleo) or "urging" (paragen≈ç). This biblical motif can be seen in various forms of relational interactions, such as:

1. Mutual encouragement among believers: In 1 Thessalonians 4:18 and Hebrews 10:25, the apostles urge believers to encourage one another, even in the face of persecution or hardship.
2. Pastor-people relationships: Elders/overseers (as in Titus 1:5-9) are called to exhort God's people to live godly lives, and this responsibility is mirrored in the role of spiritual fathers/mothers (1 Corinthians 4:15; 1 Timothy 3:2).
3. Corporate worship: The New Testament encourages corporate worship as a means of mutual encouragement (Hebrews 10:24-25; Colossians 3:16).

To approach exhortation according to the New Testament, Christians might consider the following:

1. **Grounded in scripture**: Exhortation should be rooted in and supported by Scripture (Titus 2:8; Hebrews 13:7).
2. **Empathy and understanding**: Exhorters should demonstrate compassion and empathy towards those being exhorted (Galatians 6:1-5).
3. **Humility and authenticity**: Exhortation should be marked by humility, acknowledging one's own limitations and imperfections (James 4:10; Philippians 2:3-4).
4. **Focus on Jesus Christ**: Exhortation should ultimately point to Jesus Christ as the central figure in our lives (Hebrews 12:1-3; John 14:6).
5. **Dependence on the Holy Spirit**: The empowering presence of the Holy Spirit is essential for effective exhortation (Acts 2:4, 13; Romans 15:18-19).

In conclusion, Christian exhortation in the New Testament context should be characterized by a biblical foundation, empathy, humility, focus on Jesus Christ, and dependence on the Holy Spirit.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my research on the cultural significance of bread in ancient Mediterranean societies...
