  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response that delves into the implications of God being Spirit on worship. They have effectively connected the concept of God's essence transcending physical limitations to the need for spiritual engagement in worship. The student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the essence of God and how it should influence worship. However, there is a slight deviation in the focus from the given reference answer, as the student's response expands further on the implications rather than focusing solely on the requirement for spiritual engagement. Overall, a strong and well-articulated response that aligns with a Christian worldview."
