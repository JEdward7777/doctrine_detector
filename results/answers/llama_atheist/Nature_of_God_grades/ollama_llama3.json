  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies that understanding God as Spirit means transcending physical form, which is in line with the correct answer. The concern about connecting with God in worship is also well-addressed, as the response emphasizes the importance of spiritual engagement and inner transformation over external rituals.\n\nThe response goes beyond the minimum requirements by providing several thoughtful implications for worship, including the need for humility, reverence, and a focus on inner transformation. The examples provided, such as whispers in the heart or gentle nudges, are also helpful in illustrating what it means to connect with God as Spirit.\n\nThe only areas where the response could improve are in terms of clarity and concision. Some of the sentences are quite long and convoluted, which can make them difficult to follow. Additionally, some of the points made could be more effectively organized or developed. Nevertheless, overall, this is a strong and thoughtful response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concern.\n\nComment: This response shows a good grasp of the concept that God is Spirit and its implications for worship. It would be even stronger with clearer writing and more focused development of the main points."
