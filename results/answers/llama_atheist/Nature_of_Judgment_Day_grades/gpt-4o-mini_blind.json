  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The student provides a detailed explanation of the concept of Judgment Day from a Christian perspective, citing relevant biblical passages. However, as an atheist, the student may lack the theological depth and understanding required to accurately present this doctrine. Additionally, the answer lacks a clear distinction between objective Christian beliefs and the student's personal views. More emphasis on biblical teachings and Christian doctrine rather than personal reflections would be beneficial for a higher grade."
