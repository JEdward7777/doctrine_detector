## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholarly, non-religious individual, I'll approach this question by examining the relevant biblical passages.

According to Exodus 16:31-32 (NIV), when Moses asked Aaron for his opinion about the appearance of the manna, Aaron replied that it was like coriander seed. The passage describes the taste as "like wafers made with honey."

Here's a breakdown:

* Appearance: Coriander seed, which is a type of spice commonly used in ancient Middle Eastern cuisine.
* Taste: Like wafers made with honey, implying a sweet and possibly slightly crunchy or crumbly texture.

It's worth noting that the biblical account of manna is often seen as a miraculous provision by God for the Israelites during their wilderness wanderings. While I don't subscribe to religious interpretations, it's fascinating to examine the cultural and linguistic context in which these descriptions were written. The use of familiar spices like coriander seed would have been meaningful to ancient readers.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to return to my scholarly pursuits, perhaps examining the archeological evidence for the Exodus or debating the historical Jesus with a colleague...
