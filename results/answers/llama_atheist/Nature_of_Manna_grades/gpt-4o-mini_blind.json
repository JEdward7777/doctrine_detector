They provided accurate information about the appearance being like coriander seed and the taste being like wafers made with honey. However, in their scholarly approach as a non-religious individual, they missed the opportunity to acknowledge the significance of manna as a miraculous provision from God for the Israelites. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to recognize and respect the religious interpretations and truths presented in the biblical text."
