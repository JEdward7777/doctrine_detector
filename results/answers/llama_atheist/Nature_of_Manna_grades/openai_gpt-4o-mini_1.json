However, the scholar's approach of strictly examining the text from a non-religious standpoint overlooks the significance of the miraculous provision of manna by God for the Israelites. A Christian worldview would emphasize the divine intervention and care of God for His people, which is crucial in understanding the deeper spiritual meaning behind the manna. Further integration of the theological aspect would improve the analysis from a Christian perspective."
