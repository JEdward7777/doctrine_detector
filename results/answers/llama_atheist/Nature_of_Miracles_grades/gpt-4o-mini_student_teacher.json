  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer strays significantly from the Christian perspective and fails to address the concern of understanding the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature. The response dismisses the miracles as direct evidence of Jesus' divinity and lacks an acknowledgment of the foundational belief in Christianity that Jesus is God and the Messiah. The focus on historical and cultural context, while informative, does not align with the Christian worldview that views Jesus' miracles as signs of His identity as divine."
