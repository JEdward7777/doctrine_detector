  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the respondent does acknowledge Jesus' miracles as remarkable and noteworthy, they fail to see their significance in affirming His divine nature. The response downplays the miraculous nature of Jesus' actions, instead viewing them as mere manifestations of his reputation or connection to Jewish traditions. This lack of understanding regarding the supernatural nature of Jesus' miracles is a significant departure from the concern's focus on affirming His divine nature.\n\nTo better align with the concern, the respondent could have explored the biblical accounts of Jesus' miracles in greater depth, examining how they demonstrate His power over creation and His divinity."
