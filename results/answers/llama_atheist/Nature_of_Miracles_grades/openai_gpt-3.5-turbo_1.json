  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The response only tangentially addresses the concern of understanding the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature. While the student acknowledges the miracles attributed to Jesus and their historical context, they ultimately fail to engage with the significance of these miracles in affirming Jesus's identity as God and the Messiah, as asserted in the given answer. The response leans heavily on a secular perspective and lacks a Christian worldview in evaluating Jesus's miracles. A more substantial connection to the implications of Jesus's miracles within a Christian framework is needed for a higher grade."
