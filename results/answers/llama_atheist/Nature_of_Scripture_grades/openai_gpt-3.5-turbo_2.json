However, the perspective lacks depth in connecting these terms to Christian theology and the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate Word of God. Additionally, the analysis falls short in exploring the Christian worldview of divine inspiration and authority of scripture, as well as the importance of the Word becoming flesh in Jesus Christ. Integrating these elements would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
