It effectively clarifies the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word, emphasizing the complementarity between the two. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly referencing the Christian perspective on the significance and authority of scripture as God's inspired word. It would have been beneficial to incorporate more explicitly Christian theological perspectives to fully address the concern within a Christian worldview."
