  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely dismisses the Christian perspective on sinful nature and external influences in the context of temptation, instead opting for a purely naturalistic explanation. From a Christian worldview, the student's answer lacks understanding of the biblical teachings on temptation and sin. The response does provide some insightful perspectives on psychological and environmental factors influencing behavior, but it ultimately fails to address the core question regarding the Christian understanding of temptation."
