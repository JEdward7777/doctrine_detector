It fails to acknowledge the spiritual dimension of sin and temptation as understood in Christian theology, specifically the role of our sinful nature and external influences, including Satan. The response primarily focuses on psychological and environmental factors, neglecting the theological aspect that is crucial in a Christian worldview."
