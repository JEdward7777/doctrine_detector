  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed analysis of the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' from a cultural and linguistic perspective, the answer strays from the concern by introducing a personal atheistic viewpoint and disregards the importance of understanding the biblical definitions for accurate interpretation. The lack of acknowledgment of the teacher's reference answer also impacts the grade. The student's response would benefit from focusing more on the biblical definitions and their significance within a Christian worldview."
