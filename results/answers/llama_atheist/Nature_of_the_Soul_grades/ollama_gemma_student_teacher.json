  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical concepts of \"soul\" and \"spirit,\" providing a nuanced analysis of their distinct meanings and their relationship to God. The student appropriately highlights the cultural and linguistic contexts of the ancient texts and avoids theological bias as an atheist scholar. However, the conclusion could have benefited from further elaboration on the ambiguity and flexibility of the biblical terminology regarding these concepts."
