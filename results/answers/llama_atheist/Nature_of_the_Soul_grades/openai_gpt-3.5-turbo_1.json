  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed exploration of the distinctions between \"soul\" and \"spirit\" in both the Old and New Testaments, indicating a strong understanding of the biblical texts. However, the response falls short in addressing the concern raised, as it does not directly connect the definitions to ensuring an accurate interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God. The information provided is informative and well-researched, but the connection to accurate scriptural interpretation could be more explicit and emphasized."
