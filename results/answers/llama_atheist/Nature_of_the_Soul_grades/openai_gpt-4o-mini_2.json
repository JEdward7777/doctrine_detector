However, the atheistic perspective adopted by the scholar may lead to a potential oversight of the spiritual significance and divine influence associated with the concepts of \"soul\" and \"spirit\" in a biblical context. The concern of accurately interpreting scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God was somewhat addressed, but the response could benefit from a deeper exploration of the spiritual implications of these concepts within a Christian worldview."
