  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. They effectively explained the significance of these restrictions in showing dedication and separation to God. However, the student's answer was slightly wordy and could have been more concise in addressing the question directly. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
