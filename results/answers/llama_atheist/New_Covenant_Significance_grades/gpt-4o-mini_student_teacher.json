  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the significance of the New Covenant from historical and cultural perspectives, acknowledging its impact on Western civilization. However, the response lacks recognition of the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises, which is a crucial aspect when discussing the significance of the New Covenant from a Christian worldview. The student's perspective, albeit insightful, falls short in fully addressing the core theological implications of the New Covenant established through Jesus."
