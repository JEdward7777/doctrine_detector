  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the significance of the New Covenant from both historical and cultural perspectives. They provide a comprehensive analysis of the concept, highlighting its transformative power in the context of God's promises. The student's secular perspective adds nuance to the discussion and demonstrates their ability to approach the topic from multiple viewpoints. However, the answer would benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian belief in Jesus' sacrifice as the basis for the New Covenant."
