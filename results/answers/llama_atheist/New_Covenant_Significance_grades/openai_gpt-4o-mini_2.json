It acknowledges the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice within Western civilization. However, it lacks a direct engagement with the specific concern of recognizing Jesus' sacrifice in light of God's promises. More explicit incorporation of the Christian worldview regarding the redemptive nature of Jesus' sacrifice and its fulfillment of God's promises would further enhance the response."
