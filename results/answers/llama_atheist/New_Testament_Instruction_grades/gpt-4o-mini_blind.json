  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a fair overview of the general relationship between the Psalms and the New Testament, mentioning key references such as Hebrews 13:15 and some allusions to specific Psalms. However, the perspective given is largely focused on the historical and cultural aspects rather than the theological significance of the Psalms in Christian belief. Additionally, the response lacks depth in explaining the spiritual and doctrinal importance of the Psalms for Christians. A stronger emphasis on the role of the Psalms in shaping Christian worship, prayer, and theology would have enhanced the overall grade."
