As an atheist, the student may not fully grasp the significance of Psalms in Christian worship and may not accurately convey the importance of singing psalms to God as an act of worship. Additionally, the student's interpretation lacks depth and may overlook the spiritual significance of the Psalms in Christian worship practices. More emphasis on the biblical teachings and their application to contemporary Christian worship would strengthen the response."
