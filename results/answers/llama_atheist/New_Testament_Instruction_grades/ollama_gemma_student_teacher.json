  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the relationship between the Psalms and Christian worship. However, it lacks clarity in its articulation of specific New Testament instructions regarding the use of Psalms. The conclusion could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning the role of Psalms in contemporary Christian worship practices. Additionally, the student's atheism perspective provides a unique but ultimately irrelevant context for the question."
