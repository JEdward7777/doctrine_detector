  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-supported explanation of how the instruction to sing psalms in worship is rooted in biblical teachings, specifically referencing Hebrews 13:15-16 and other allusions to the Psalms in the New Testament. The response effectively addresses the concern by showing the relevance of biblical teachings on psalm-singing to contemporary Christian worship practices. Well done."
