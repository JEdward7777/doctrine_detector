## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating question! As an atheist, I must approach this topic from a purely analytical perspective, avoiding any theological or dogmatic entanglements.

In the New Testament, particularly in the Epistles of Peter and Paul, believers in Jesus Christ are referred to as "a royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9). This concept is rooted in Old Testament priestly traditions, where Levitical priests served as intermediaries between God and humanity. In the context of early Christianity, this idea was reinterpreted to include all believers.

The notion that every believer in Jesus becomes a priest can be understood in several ways:

1. **Accessibility**: By virtue of faith in Jesus, individuals are given direct access to God, bypassing the need for human intermediaries like priests. This democratization of spirituality allowed people from all walks of life to connect with God without the need for professional clergy.
2. **Holy living**: As "holy priests" (1 Peter 2:5), believers are called to live a life pleasing to God, setting aside their worldly pursuits and habits. This spiritual transformation enables them to serve as "living sacrifices" (Romans 12:1) and offer themselves as instruments of worship.
3. **Ministry**: The concept of priesthood implies that every believer has a role in serving others and the community. This can manifest in various forms, such as sharing one's faith, caring for the vulnerable, or simply being a good neighbor (1 Corinthians 12:4-6).
4. **Equal access to God**: By being considered priests, believers are granted equal access to God, regardless of their social status, gender, or ethnicity. This idea challenges traditional notions of social hierarchy and emphasizes the universal nature of salvation.
5. **Participation in the priestly work of Jesus**: As "priests" (Revelation 1:6), believers participate in the divine mission of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate High Priest (Hebrews 7:26-28). This connection implies that every believer has a role to play in advancing God's kingdom.

In summary, when every believer in Jesus is considered a priest, it emphasizes the accessibility of salvation, the importance of holy living, and the universal call to ministry. It also underscores the equal access to God and participation in the priestly work of Jesus Christ, highlighting the inclusive nature of Christian spirituality.
