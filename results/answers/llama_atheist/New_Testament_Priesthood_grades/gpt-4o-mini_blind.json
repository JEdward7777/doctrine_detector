The approach of setting aside theology and doctrine due to the author being an atheist is incompatible with answering from a Christian perspective. The answer lacks acknowledgment of the sacrificial atonement and mediation aspects inherent in the priesthood, which are foundational to understanding believers as priests in the New Testament. Encouragement for improvement would include integrating key doctrinal elements such as Christ's role as the ultimate High Priest and believers' participation in His priestly work."
