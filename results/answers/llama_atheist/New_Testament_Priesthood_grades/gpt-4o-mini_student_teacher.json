  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-reasoned explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers from a purely analytical perspective. They accurately referenced biblical passages and outlined various facets of what it means for every believer to be considered a priest in the New Testament. However, the student's approach lacked a Christian-specific worldview that emphasizes the role of believers as priests to intercede for themselves and others before God. Additionally, the student's analysis did not fully capture the spiritual significance and theological depth of the priesthood of all believers as outlined in the teacher's reference answer."
