The incorporation of relevant biblical references and the detailed explanation of how this concept influences believers' relationship with God and their role in the Christian community are commendable. However, from a Christian perspective, it would have been beneficial to highlight the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest in this context. Overall, a well-articulated and thoughtful response."
