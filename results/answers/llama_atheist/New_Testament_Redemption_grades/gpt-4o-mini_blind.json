It correctly identifies the shift from external rituals to internal transformation and highlights the significance of Jesus Christ in bringing about spiritual renewal. The scriptural references and the summary at the end help solidify the points made. The only area for improvement would be to further elaborate on the role of the Holy Spirit in the process of purification in the New Testament."
