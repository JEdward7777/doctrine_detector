  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student does a good job outlining the differences in the concept of purification between the Old and New Testaments. They accurately discuss the shift from external rituals in the Old Testament to internal transformation in the New Testament, as well as the significance of Jesus' sacrifice for eternal purification from sin.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could be improved by placing greater emphasis on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, as stated in the reference answer. The student briefly mentions Jesus' sacrifice but does not explicitly connect it to being permanently cleansed from sin through repentance and trust in Him.\n\nOverall, the student shows a strong understanding of the topic and presents it well, but could enhance their answer by directly addressing the concern provided in the reference answer."
