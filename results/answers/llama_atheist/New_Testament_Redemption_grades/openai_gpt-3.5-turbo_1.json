It accurately compares the shift from external rituals and physical cleansing in the Old Testament to internal transformation and spiritual renewal in the New Testament through Jesus Christ. The explanation is detailed, well-supported by relevant biblical references, and aligns well with the Christian worldview's understanding of purification through faith in Jesus and His sacrifice."
