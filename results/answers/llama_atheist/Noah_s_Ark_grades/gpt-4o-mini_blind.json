However, the answer lacks a clear acknowledgment of the sacredness and divine purpose of the biblical account as revealed in the Christian worldview. The explanation falls short in emphasizing the biblical truth that the Ark was a means of God's judgment on sin and His mercy towards a remnant of creation and humanity, rather than just being a myth or symbolic tale. It is important for a Christian perspective to uphold the theological significance and divine intent behind Noah's Ark."
