However, from a Christian worldview, the answer should emphasize the aspect of understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative of Noah's Ark more prominently. The response from the atheist scholar does acknowledge the biblical perspective but falls short in highlighting the divine purpose behind the story. Incorporating more emphasis on God's judgment on humanity and the theme of redemption through Noah's obedience to God's instructions would have strengthened the Christian perspective in the answer."
