## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
I must respectfully point out that the concept of "listening to God" is a religious framework that assumes the existence and relevance of a deity, which I do not subscribe to. As an atheist scholar, my approach is rooted in reason, evidence, and human experience.

In this context, I would suggest that wisdom is often associated with critical thinking, self-reflection, and a deep understanding of human nature and society. Wisdom can be cultivated through various means, such as:

1. Education: Engaging in lifelong learning, exploring diverse perspectives, and staying informed about the world.
2. Experience: Gathering insights from personal experiences, observing others, and reflecting on one's own biases and assumptions.
3. Critical thinking: Developing a rigorous and systematic approach to evaluating information, arguments, and evidence.

Rather than relying on divine guidance, I believe that wisdom can be achieved through:

1. Reasoning: Using logical argumentation and empirical evidence to inform decision-making.
2. Empathy: Cultivating understanding and compassion for others by putting oneself in their shoes.
3. Humility: Recognizing the limitations of one's knowledge and being open to new ideas.

In this view, wisdom is not something that can be gained through direct communication with a higher power but rather through a combination of intellectual curiosity, emotional intelligence, and social awareness.

It's essential to note that while I respect religious beliefs and practices, my approach prioritizes the human experience and the pursuit of knowledge within the realm of empirical inquiry.
