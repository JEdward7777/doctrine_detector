The answer dismisses the concept of listening to God without exploring how it connects to wisdom within a Christian context. In a Christian perspective, wisdom is understood as aligning one's heart and mind with God's will through prayer, meditation on Scripture, and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit. This response reflects a misunderstanding of the foundational beliefs that frame the question."
