  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides a well-articulated perspective from an atheist standpoint on how wisdom can be cultivated through reason, evidence, and human experience, it does not directly engage with the question of how listening to God connects to becoming wise. The concern raised about recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom is not addressed, and the student's response does not reflect a Christian worldview. In a Christian-specific context, wisdom is often seen as aligning with God's will and guidance, which was not acknowledged in the student's answer."
