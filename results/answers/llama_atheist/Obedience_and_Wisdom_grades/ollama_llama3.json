  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges the original answer and concern, it fundamentally disagrees with the idea of \"listening to God\" as a means of achieving wisdom. Instead, the author proposes a human-centered approach rooted in reason, evidence, and human experience. This departure from the original perspective is not addressed or reconciled, which reduces the response's connection to the original concern.\n\nThe grade of 40 reflects the response's partial acknowledgment of the original answer and concern, but its significant divergence from the Christian worldview and emphasis on obedience to God."
