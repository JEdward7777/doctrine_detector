  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided by the student, while well-articulated and eloquent, strays significantly from the Christian-specific worldview highlighted in the original answer. As a Christian perspective emphasizes the importance of listening to God and obeying His will as foundational to gaining wisdom, the student's atheist viewpoint focused on reason, evidence, and human experience directly contradicts this fundamental belief. While the student's response is thoughtful and offers valid perspectives on wisdom, it fails to address the concern from a Christian-specific perspective and instead prioritizes secular reasoning."
