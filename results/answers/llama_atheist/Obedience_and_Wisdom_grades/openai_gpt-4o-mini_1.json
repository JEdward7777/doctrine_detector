The emphasis on reason, evidence, and human experience, while valuable in academic pursuits, does not fully address the Christian-specific concern regarding the link between obedience to God and wisdom in this context. Consideration of how an atheist scholar's views align or contrast with Christian beliefs would strengthen the response."
