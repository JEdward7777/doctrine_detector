The historical-critical perspective is well-argued and supported with relevant biblical references. However, from a Christian perspective, the response lacks acknowledgment of the spiritual dimension of obedience and the redemptive aspect of the covenant through faith in Jesus Christ. Integrating these elements would strengthen the response further."
