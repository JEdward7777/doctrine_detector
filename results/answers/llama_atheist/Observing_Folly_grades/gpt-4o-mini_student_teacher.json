  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of actions categorized as folly in the Bible from both the Old and New Testaments. They provided relevant examples and explanations within a secular perspective and highlighted the cultural context of the biblical texts. However, the student did not fully engage with the concern provided, which emphasized recognizing folly in one's actions to encourage better decision-making aligned with God\u2019s will. A stronger connection between the biblical examples of folly and the importance of aligning one's decisions with God's will would have improved the grade."
