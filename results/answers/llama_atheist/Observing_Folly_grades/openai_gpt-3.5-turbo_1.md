## [Answer](../Observing_Folly.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a critical thinker, I'll approach this question from a secular perspective and examine how the Bible addresses behaviors considered "folly" within its cultural context. Please note that my analysis is based on the biblical texts themselves, rather than any personal beliefs or biases.

In the Old Testament, folly often refers to actions that disregard wisdom, morality, and divine laws. Here are some examples:

1. Ignoring God's commands: Isaiah 29:13 says, "This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." Disregarding God's will and commands can be seen as foolish.
2. Pursuing wealth and power at any cost: Proverbs 22:27-28 warns against exploiting the poor to accumulate wealth: "Ears that listen to mockery and eyes that gaze on rascals—this I consider a curse."
3. Fostering injustice: Psalm 94:5-6 laments, "They know not, nor do they ponder in their hearts when his soul is troubled; still, he prays to God and is favored." Ignoring the suffering of others or perpetuating injustice can be considered foolish.
4. Engaging in excessive revelry: Ecclesiastes 7:2-3 describes the futility of overindulging in pleasure: "It's been given to everyone by the Creator to eat, drink, and find joy. And even this will have no end—except that people should always be careful about this, because the days will come when he will be saying, 'Taste and see that it is good!'"
5. Disregarding wisdom: Proverbs 1:7 says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have a good understanding." Failing to seek wisdom or ignoring moral guidance can be seen as foolish.
6. Fostering division and strife: James 3:16-17 cautions against causing divisions: "For where you have envy and selfish ambition, that's chaos and every evil thing. But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peaceful, reasonable, and full of mercy."
7. Disrespecting elders and authority: Proverbs 23:1-3 advises against neglecting one's parents or authorities: "Do not despise your father's discipline, and do not resent your mother's instruction, though they seem harsh to you." Ignoring the guidance of those in authority can be considered foolish.

In the New Testament, Jesus often condemned actions that were foolish from a moral perspective. For example:

1. Failing to show compassion: Matthew 25:42-43 highlights the consequences of neglecting those in need: "So then, just as you judge people who do these things and yet do them yourself, condemn yourselves because you are condemning others for doing what you do."
2. Pursuing power and prestige over humility: Mark 10:42-45 warns against seeking positions of authority at the expense of serving others: "Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
3. Fostering division and hate: John 13:34-35 emphasizes the importance of love and unity: "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."

In both testaments, these examples illustrate behaviors considered foolish because they disregard wisdom, morality, and divine laws. However, it's essential to approach these texts within their historical context and recognize the cultural biases inherent in ancient writings.
