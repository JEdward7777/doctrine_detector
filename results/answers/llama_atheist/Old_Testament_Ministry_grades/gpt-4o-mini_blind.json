The information provided is accurate and covers various aspects of priestly duties and roles. However, it could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the significance of the priesthood in pointing towards Christ as the ultimate High Priest and fulfillment of the sacrificial system in the New Testament. Connecting the Old Testament priesthood to its foreshadowing of Christ's work would have strengthened the theological depth of the answer.\n"
