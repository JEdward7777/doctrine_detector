  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-structured overview of how the priests in the Old Testament carried out their ministry in the temple. They covered various aspects such as temple structure, priestly duties, specific roles, and training. The response was informative and demonstrated a good understanding of the topic. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the central aspect of ministering to God through sacrifices, temple care, and prayer as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
