  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough comparison of the concept of atonement in the Old and New Testaments, addressing different aspects of the understanding and implications in each context. However, the answer fails to directly address the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The student's response lacks a clear distinction between temporary and permanent atonement as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, the response's perspective from an atheist worldview does not align with the Christian-specific worldview required for this question. Further development of the transition from temporary to permanent atonement and integration of a Christian worldview perspective would improve the student's answer."
