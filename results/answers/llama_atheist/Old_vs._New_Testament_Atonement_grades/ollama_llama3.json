  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a thorough exploration of the concept of atonement in both the Old and New Testaments, which addresses the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The author does an excellent job of highlighting the differences between the two testaments' understanding of atonement, particularly in their respective views on purification, ritual restoration, and redemption.\n\nHowever, while the response provides a detailed analysis of both OT and NT understandings of atonement, it doesn't directly address the specific concern about clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement. The author's focus is more on providing an exhaustive description of each testament's understanding rather than explicitly exploring how these two concepts are related or how they evolve over time.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest that the author could have explicitly addressed the concern by highlighting key passages or events in biblical history that illustrate the transition from temporary to permanent atonement. This could involve examining the role of Jesus Christ's sacrifice as a turning point in understanding atonement, and how this new perspective builds upon the earlier understandings presented in the OT.\n\nOverall, while the response is well-structured and informative, it could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern about clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement."
