  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and thoughtful comparison between the Old Testament and New Testament understandings of atonement, addressing the concern raised about the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The comparison effectively demonstrates the shift from temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament to Christ's single, permanent sacrifice in the New Testament. The response could have further highlighted the significance of Christ's sacrifice in fulfilling the prophetic foreshadowing of atonement in the Old Testament."
