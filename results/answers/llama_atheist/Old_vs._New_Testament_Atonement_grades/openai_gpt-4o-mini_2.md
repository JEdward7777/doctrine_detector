What a fascinating question! As an atheist, I'll attempt to provide a culturally nuanced and historically informed response.

In the Old Testament (OT), atonement is primarily understood as a process of purification and reconciliation between God and Israel. The concept is rooted in the priestly system established in Leviticus, where sacrifices were offered to cleanse ritual impurities and make restitution for moral transgressions. Atonement was seen as a means to restore balance and order within the cosmos, rather than a direct act of divine forgiveness.

In this OT context, atonement was often associated with the concept of "covering" or "making amends." The High Priest would offer sacrifices on behalf of Israel, thereby covering their sins and restoring their relationship with Yahweh. This understanding is reflected in passages like Leviticus 16:20-22, where the blood of the sacrifice serves as a "atonement for all the people."

In contrast, the New Testament (NT) presents a more radical and profound concept of atonement. The NT sees Jesus Christ's death on the cross as the ultimate act of atonement, which bridges the chasm between humanity and God. This understanding is rooted in the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

In this NT context, atonement is no longer seen merely as a means to restore ritual purity or moral balance but as a direct and personal act of redemption. Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is seen as the moment when humanity's sin was forgiven, and reconciliation with God became possible through faith in Christ (Romans 3:24-25; Ephesians 1:7).

The NT emphasizes that atonement is not just about restoring a broken relationship between humans and God but also about making it possible for humans to have a right relationship with God. Atonement becomes a means by which sinful humanity can be restored to its original purpose and destiny, as revealed in Jesus' teachings and the apostolic writings.

In summary, while both OT and NT understand atonement as a process of reconciliation, the OT emphasizes purification and ritual restoration, whereas the NT presents a more radical understanding of atonement through Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of atonement in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the transition from temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament to the permanent atonement through Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament. The answer effectively addresses the concern by explaining this transition in biblical history. However, there could be a more direct connection between the given answer and the response provided, as well as a clearer emphasis on the significance of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate and sufficient atonement for all sins.
