The emphasis on unity and inclusivity, while important in cultural dialogue, should not come at the expense of compromising the core biblical truth of monotheism. The focus on alternative perspectives and non-theistic concepts dilutes the distinctiveness of the Christian belief in one God. A stronger emphasis on teaching about God's unique nature within the framework of the Trinity, while respecting cultural diversity, would better address the concern presented."
