The suggestions provided veer away from the biblical concept of one God and instead emphasize a more inclusive and diverse understanding of unity that may compromise on biblical monotheism. It is important to maintain the distinctiveness of biblical monotheism while being culturally sensitive, which this response does not adequately address."
