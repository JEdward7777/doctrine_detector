The inclusion of both the agricultural and religious aspects of the festival is well done. However, a more explicit connection to the Christian significance of Pentecost, such as the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and its fulfillment in the New Testament, could have deepened the analysis. Overall, a solid exploration of the festival's pre-New Testament context."
