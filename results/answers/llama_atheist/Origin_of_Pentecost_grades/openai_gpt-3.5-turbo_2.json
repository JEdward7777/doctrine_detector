It effectively connects the festival to the agricultural celebration, the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai, and the emphasis on righteous living and gratitude. The response could have further emphasized the importance of connecting biblical festivals to their fulfillment in Christ, especially considering the future significance of Pentecost in the New Testament."
