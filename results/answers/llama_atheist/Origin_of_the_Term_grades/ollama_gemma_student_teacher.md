## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of Christian origins!

While it's impossible to pinpoint the exact moment or location where Jesus' followers were first referred to as "Christians," historians and scholars have made some educated guesses based on available evidence.

One of the earliest references to Christians is found in the works of the Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote around 116 CE. In his book "Histories," Tacitus mentions a group called "Chrestiani" or "Christiani" when describing the execution of Jesus' apostle Peter and others during the reign of Emperor Nero (54-68 CE). This passage is often cited as one of the earliest non-Christian references to Christians.

Another possible early reference can be found in the writings of the Greek historian Pliny the Younger, who served as a magistrate in Bithynia (modern-day Turkey) around 111-113 CE. In his letters to Emperor Trajan, Pliny mentions a group called "Christians" who were being persecuted and executed by the Roman authorities.

As for where Jesus' followers might have been first referred to as "Christians," some scholars propose that it could have happened in Antioch (modern-day Antakya, Turkey), which was an important center of early Christianity. The city is mentioned in several early Christian texts, including the New Testament book of Acts and the writings of the apostle Paul.

In fact, the Antiochene church is often credited with being one of the first to use the term "Christian" to describe themselves. This might have happened as a response to the persecution they faced under Emperor Nero, which led them to develop a distinct identity and label themselves as followers of Christ (Greek: Χριστιανός, Christianos).

Of course, this is all speculative, and we can't know for certain when or where Jesus' followers were first called "Christians." Nonetheless, these early references provide valuable insights into the development of early Christianity and its interactions with the larger Greco-Roman world.
