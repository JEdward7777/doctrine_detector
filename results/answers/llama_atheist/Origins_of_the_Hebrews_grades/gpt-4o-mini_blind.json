The acknowledgment of historical influences on the genealogical traditions is commendable, but the emphasis on viewing the biblical account solely from a historical-critical perspective may slightly undermine the significance of the divine affirmation and chosen status of the Hebrews by God. A stronger emphasis on the theological implications of the Hebrew lineage would enhance the answer within a Christian-specific worldview."
