  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical genealogy of the Hebrews and clearly articulates the lineage from Shem to Abraham. The inclusion of historical-critical insights regarding possible influences from ancient Near Eastern traditions adds depth to the analysis. While the reference answer focuses on Abraham as the patriarch, the student's response provides a broader genealogical framework, which aligns with the Christian specific worldview that emphasizes the importance of Shem as the progenitor of the Hebrew people."
