# Answer by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I approach this question without any preconceptions or biases based on religious or cultural backgrounds. According to the biblical account, the Hebrews are descended from Shem, one of the three sons of Noah.

In Genesis 5-10, we find the genealogical table that connects Shem to Abraham and ultimately to the Israelites. Shem is said to have been born to Noah and his wife after the great flood, along with his brothers Ham and Japheth (Genesis 9:18-27). The biblical account then follows the descendants of Shem through several generations, highlighting key figures such as Arphaxad, Eber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, and Abram (Abraham).

This lineage is crucial to understanding the Hebrew people's identity and their claims of being a distinct nation chosen by God. The biblical account emphasizes that the Hebrews are descended from Shem, who is said to have been blessed by Noah himself (Genesis 9:26-27). This blessing is seen as a divine affirmation of Shem's line, which would ultimately produce the patriarch Abraham and his descendants.

From a historical-critical perspective, it's important to note that the biblical account of the Hebrews' descent from Shem might have been influenced by ancient Near Eastern genealogical traditions. Nevertheless, this narrative remains a cornerstone of Jewish and Christian identity, shaping their understanding of themselves as a people chosen by God.
