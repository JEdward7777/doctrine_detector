It acknowledges both the biblical account and the potential influence of ancient Near Eastern traditions on this genealogy. However, the response does not directly address the given answer that the Hebrews are descended from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob. While the information provided is valuable for grasping biblical narratives, connecting it more explicitly to the given answer would have strengthened the response further."
