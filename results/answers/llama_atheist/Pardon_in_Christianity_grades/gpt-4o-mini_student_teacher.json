  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of pardon and forgiveness from a philosophical and cultural perspective. However, the response fails to engage with the Christian-specific worldview requested in the question. The student's perspective as an atheist is respected, but in the context of grading based on a Christian-specific worldview, the lack of consideration for divine forgiveness through Jesus Christ significantly detracts from the overall alignment with the given reference answer."
