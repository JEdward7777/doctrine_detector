However, it falls short in not clearly stating the foundational Christian belief that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Passover lamb, whose sacrifice brings salvation and deliverance from sin. The explanation lacks depth in emphasizing the atoning work of Jesus on the cross as the ultimate fulfillment of the Passover symbolism. Additionally, the mention of the resurrection could have been expanded upon to elucidate the complete narrative of redemption in Christian theology."
