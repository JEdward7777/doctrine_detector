  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student demonstrates a good understanding of the connection between the Old Testament Passover and Jesus in the context of Christianity, the response falls short in clearly stating the significance of Jesus as the Passover Lamb. As an atheist, the student may lack the depth of insight and personal connection to the Christian faith required to fully articulate the Christian perspective on this topic. The response also lacks explicit reference to Jesus as the perfect and sinless sacrifice for humanity, which is a fundamental aspect of the connection between Passover and Jesus in Christian belief."
