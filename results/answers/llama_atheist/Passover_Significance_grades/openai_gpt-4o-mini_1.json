It effectively highlights how Jesus is viewed as the ultimate Passover Lamb, symbolizing His sacrificial role in bringing redemption and liberation to humanity. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of Passover in Christianity and articulates the theological implications of Jesus' sacrifice in relation to the Passover tradition. Great job integrating biblical references and theological concepts to support the argument."
