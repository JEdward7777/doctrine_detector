  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 90.\n\nThis response effectively applies the concern of encouraging perseverance and faith in difficult circumstances to the story of Paul's stoning in Lystra. The writer provides seven key takeaways from the passage, which are all relevant to the concern. The takeaways provide practical advice on how to persevere in the face of adversity, such as recognizing that opposition is inevitable, prioritizing faith over human opinion, and trusting in God's sovereignty.\n\nThe response also highlights the importance of building up the local church, embracing the unknown, and cultivating a strong support network, all of which are crucial for perseverance. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points and emphasizes the need to trust in God's provision in difficult circumstances.\n\nThe only thing that keeps me from giving it a perfect score is that the response could be more concise and focused on the specific concern. Some of the takeaways seem to be somewhat tangential, and the response could be tightened up by cutting out some of the extraneous information. Overall, however, this is an excellent response that effectively applies the passage to the concern."
