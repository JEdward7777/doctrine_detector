The analysis is clear and insightful, demonstrating an understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic. However, there could have been a more explicit connection made between the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. Overall, a strong response from a Christian worldview perspective."
