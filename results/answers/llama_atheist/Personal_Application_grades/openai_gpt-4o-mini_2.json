It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how purification from sin impacts a Christian's daily walk with God and their striving for holiness in practical terms."
