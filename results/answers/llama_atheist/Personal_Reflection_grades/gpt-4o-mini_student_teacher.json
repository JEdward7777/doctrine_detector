  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful analysis of the phrase \"Woe is me\" by exploring its historical, contextual, and modern usage. They correctly identified elements such as awareness, resignation, and self-pity associated with the expression. However, the student could have strengthened their answer by emphasizing the spiritual aspect of recognizing one's suffering or sin, as per the concern provided. They could have connected the concept of \"Woe is me\" more explicitly to personal reflection on one's spiritual state and awareness of sin."
