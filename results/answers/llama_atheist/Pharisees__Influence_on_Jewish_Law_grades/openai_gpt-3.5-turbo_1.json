It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how the Pharisees' strict interpretation of the Law impacted Jesus' ministry. The reference to individuals like Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could have further emphasized the spiritual aspect of the law and how Jesus sought to move beyond mere legalism towards a deeper relationship with God."
