  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses affected their interactions with Jesus and early Christians. It effectively articulates the implications of the Pharisees' focus on the letter of the law rather than its spirit, as emphasized by Jesus. The inclusion of examples like Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea adds depth to the analysis. Overall, a strong understanding of the Pharisees' role in relation to Jesus' ministry is demonstrated."
