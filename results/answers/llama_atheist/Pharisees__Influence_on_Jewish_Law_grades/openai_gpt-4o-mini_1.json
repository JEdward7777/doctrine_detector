  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of the Pharisees' interactions with Jesus and early Christians, highlighting their strict legalism and the resulting conflicts. It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how the Pharisees' rigid interpretation of the law posed challenges to Jesus' ministry. The inclusion of examples like Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea adds depth to the explanation. The response could be enhanced by emphasizing the Pharisees' need for heart transformation rather than just focusing on external observances. Overall, well done."
