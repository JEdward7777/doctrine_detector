  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and scholarly explanation of the term \"Son of God,\" emphasizing its theological significance and historical context. The student effectively addresses the misconception of physical offspring and offers relevant insights from Christian theology and scripture. The response could be further strengthened by providing more explicit references to key theological doctrines, such as the hypostatic union and the relationship within the Trinity. Additionally, a clearer presentation of the student's perspective or personal beliefs on the matter would enhance the overall argument."
