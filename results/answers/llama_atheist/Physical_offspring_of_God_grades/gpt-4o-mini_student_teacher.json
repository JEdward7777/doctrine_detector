  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched explanation of the term \"Son of God\" in Christian theology, highlighting its various connotations and providing in-depth historical and scriptural context. The student effectively addressed the concern by emphasizing Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, rather than physical procreation. The only suggestion for improvement would be to make the explanation more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern raised in the question."
