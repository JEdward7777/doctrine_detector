  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response thoroughly addresses the concern of proper teaching, providing a nuanced understanding of the term \"Son of God\" that goes beyond its literal meaning. The explanation highlights Jesus' divine nature, his role as mediator between humanity and God, and his intimate connection with God. The suggestion to provide historical context, scriptural support, and engage in respectful dialogue further demonstrates a commitment to proper teaching.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the potential for some readers to still be confused about the concept of \"Son of God\" due to its complexity. While the response provides a clear explanation, it may benefit from additional examples or analogies to help illustrate the idea that Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God are central to his identity as the Son of God.\n\nOverall, this response effectively addresses the concern of proper teaching and provides a solid foundation for understanding the term \"Son of God\" within a Christian context."
