  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while thoughtful and well-written, does not address the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death from a Christian worldview. The response lacks a direct reference to the eternal consequences and the importance of trusting in Jesus, which are essential aspects when discussing the spiritual meaning of 'perish' in Christianity. The student's answer, therefore, does not align with the specified concern and lacks a Christian-specific perspective."
