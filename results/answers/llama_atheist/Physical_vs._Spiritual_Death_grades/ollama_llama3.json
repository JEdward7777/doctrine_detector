While the response acknowledges that language is culturally-retributed and context-dependent, it does not specifically address the eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus. The answer provided as a reference point also seems to be too narrow and dogmatic, not considering alternative perspectives or nuances. The response could have been improved by engaging more deeply with the concern about clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death, and exploring the implications of that distinction for human existence and understanding of mortality."
