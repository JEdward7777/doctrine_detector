However, while it acknowledges different interpretations, it falls short of emphasizing the crucial distinction between physical and spiritual death, as highlighted in the specified concern. The mention of the spiritual consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus could have been integrated more explicitly to align with the Christian worldview."
