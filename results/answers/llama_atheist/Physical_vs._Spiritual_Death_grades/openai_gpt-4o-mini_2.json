However, it did not adequately address the concern of clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the concept in a Christian worldview. The response lacked a clear emphasis on the eternal consequences associated with spiritual \"perishing\" for those who do not trust in Jesus, which is a foundational belief in Christianity. Integration of this perspective would have significantly enhanced the response from a Christian worldview."
