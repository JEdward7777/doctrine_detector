  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed response on how early Christians expressed their fellowship, drawing from historical and cultural perspectives. However, the answer falls short of the Christian worldview by failing to acknowledge the central role of God's Word and prayer in Christian fellowship. The emphasis on communal meals and shared resources is valid but should have been linked more explicitly to the spiritual aspects of fellowship in a Christian context. The student's perspective as an atheist also influences the analysis, which diminishes the evaluation of Christian fellowship practices."
