The elaboration on communal meals, sharing of resources, collective worship, small-group gatherings, and the importance of brotherly love adds depth to the understanding of Christian fellowship. The incorporation of biblical references enhances the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective. However, the response could have further emphasized the application of these historical practices in contemporary Christian communities to address the concern more directly."
