  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of predestination within Christian theology, including its biblical basis and theological implications. The answer accurately addresses the concern regarding God deciding beforehand which individuals will receive eternal life. However, the response lacks a Christian-specific perspective or interpretation in discussing predestination, as it approaches the concept from an atheistic worldview focused on naturalistic explanations. To improve the grade, the response could benefit from incorporating a critical analysis from a Christian worldview regarding the implications of predestination for salvation and divine sovereignty."
