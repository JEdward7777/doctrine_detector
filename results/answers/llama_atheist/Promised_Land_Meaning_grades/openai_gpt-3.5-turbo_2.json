It approaches the concept solely from a secular, skeptical perspective and does not engage with the theological implications of the Promised Land within the context of God's covenant with Abraham. A stronger Christian perspective on the biblical significance of God's promises and their fulfillment through the Promised Land is needed for a more thorough response."
