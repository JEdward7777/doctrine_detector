The focus on secular interpretations detracts from the Christian worldview which emphasizes the covenant God made with Abraham as a key aspect of His plan for humanity. Further exploration of the theological implications of God's promises within the biblical narrative would have been beneficial to provide a more comprehensive understanding."
