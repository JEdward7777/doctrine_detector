  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in Biblical prophecies, showing a clear understanding of its significance in conveying divine messages to the people of Israel. The response also demonstrates a thoughtful examination of the historical context and theological implications of the term. There is a strong connection made between the metaphorical usage of \"Daughter of Zion\" and its representation of God's relationship with His chosen people. The examples provided from Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel further strengthen the analysis.\n\nThe only minor concern is that the response could have included a more direct and concise explanation, similar to the reference answer, to ensure a more focused approach to the question. Overall, the student's answer shows a solid grasp of the topic with scholarly depth."
