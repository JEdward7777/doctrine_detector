  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer rooted in Christian teachings regarding a strong protective desire in a relationship. They made appropriate references to biblical passages and encompassed various practical ways this concept can be applied. The student emphasized the importance of wisdom, responsibility, and care in relationships, reflecting Christian values. While the student's answer aligns closely with the reference answer, there could have been a stronger emphasis on safeguarding purity and faithfulness in the relationship to more closely mirror God's desire for His relationship with His people."
