  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the answer provides valuable secular perspectives on discerning purpose, it lacks a Christian worldview perspective as requested. The student fails to incorporate Biblical principles or references to guide individuals in understanding their calling or purpose according to Christian beliefs. The importance of seeking God's will, praying for guidance, studying scripture, and acknowledging God's sovereignty in shaping one's purpose is absent. The response could benefit from integrating Christian teachings on purpose and calling to align it with a Christian worldview."
