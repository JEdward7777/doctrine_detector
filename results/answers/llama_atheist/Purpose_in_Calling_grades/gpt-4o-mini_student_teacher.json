  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 60.\n\nWhile the student put effort into providing a detailed and thoughtful secular perspective on discerning one's purpose or calling, their analysis lacks a Christian-specific worldview which is crucial for this topic. The student did not mention the importance of prayer, studying Scripture, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, or understanding one's gifts and passions as outlined in the reference answer from a Christian perspective.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the student should have integrated these key Christian principles into their response, recognizing that true clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life come from aligning one's calling with the will of God as revealed in Scripture and through prayerful discernment with the guidance of the Holy Spirit."
