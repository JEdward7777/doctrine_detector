  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced approach to the question of discerning one's calling. They provide a comprehensive and well-reasoned secular perspective, offering practical suggestions that align with Christian principles. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of human values, passions, and the importance of self-reflection. However, it would be more helpful if the student had acknowledged the importance of spiritual guidance from the Holy Spirit and prayer in the process of discerning one's calling from a Christian worldview."
