However, it does not address the concern of finding clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose specifically. From a Christian worldview, prayer, studying Scripture, and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit are essential components in understanding and fulfilling God's purpose for an individual's life. Encouraging reliance on these spiritual practices would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
