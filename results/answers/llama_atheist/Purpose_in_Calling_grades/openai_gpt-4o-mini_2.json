However, from a Christian worldview perspective, there is a significant absence of emphasis on the role of prayer, studying Scripture, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, and understanding one's gifts and passions in fulfilling God's purpose. While the secular advice is valuable in a general sense, the response could be greatly enhanced by integrating and highlighting the importance of seeking God's guidance in discerning and fulfilling one's calling."
