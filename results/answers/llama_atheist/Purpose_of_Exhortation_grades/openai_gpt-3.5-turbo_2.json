However, the answer does not directly address the concern of understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey from a Christian worldview. While the response provides valuable insights, it falls short of directly connecting the concept of exhortation to the biblical mandate of encouraging others in their faith journey according to God's will."
