While the response does not explicitly reference the given answer about persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, it effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of exhortation in guiding believers in their faith journey. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey from a Christian perspective."
