The perspective offered aligns with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the moral guidance and motivation inherent in exhortation for believers. While the response does not directly link every aspect to persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will as the primary purpose, it effectively addresses the concern by discussing how exhortation serves to encourage and guide individuals in their faith journey."
