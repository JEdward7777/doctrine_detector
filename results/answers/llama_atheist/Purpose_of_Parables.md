## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must approach this question from a neutral and historically-informed perspective. While the Gospels present Jesus' use of parables as a means of conveying divine truth to his followers, I believe it's essential to examine the cultural and historical context in which he lived.

In ancient Jewish culture, parables were a common literary device used by wise men and teachers to convey moral lessons and wisdom. The Hebrew Bible itself contains several examples of parabolic stories, such as Nathan's story about the rich man and the poor man (2 Samuel 12:1-7) or Aesop-like fables like the one about the mustard seed (Matthew 13:31-32).

In this context, Jesus' use of parables can be seen as a means of:

1. Teaching complex theological concepts in an accessible way: By using everyday scenarios and relatable characters, Jesus could convey abstract ideas about God's kingdom, forgiveness, and social justice to his listeners.
2. Encouraging critical thinking and interpretation: Parables often require the listener to draw their own conclusions, promoting critical thinking and engagement with the message.
3. Providing a sense of authenticity and familiarity: As a Jewish teacher, Jesus may have drawn upon familiar literary forms to establish credibility and connection with his audience.
4. Fostering community and shared understanding: Parables can be used as a tool for building relationships and fostering a sense of shared experience among those who hear the story.

It's essential to note that the purpose of Jesus' parables might not have been primarily to convey divine revelation or mysteries of the universe, but rather to facilitate meaningful interactions with his followers. By using parables, Jesus may have aimed to create a space for discussion, reflection, and collective interpretation, ultimately promoting a sense of community and shared understanding among his listeners.

This perspective is rooted in the historical and cultural context of ancient Judaism, where wisdom literature and storytelling were valued as means of conveying moral guidance and spiritual insight. By acknowledging this cultural backdrop, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' use of parables and their significance within his teachings.
