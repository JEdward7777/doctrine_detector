However, the response lacks a Christian-specific viewpoint and does not address the primary purpose of Jesus using parables from a doctrinal perspective. It focuses more on the secular understanding of parables rather than exploring the divine intent behind Jesus' teachings. Incorporating insights from Christian theology and Scripture would strengthen the answer and align it more closely with a Christian worldview."
