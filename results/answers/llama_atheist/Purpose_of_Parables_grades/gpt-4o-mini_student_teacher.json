  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a well-reasoned analysis of Jesus' use of parables from a historical perspective, highlighting the cultural context and potential purposes behind this teaching method. However, the answer strays from the Christian-specific worldview by not directly addressing the spiritual implications or the divinely inspired nature of Jesus' parables. From a Christian perspective, the primary purpose of Jesus using parables is to reveal divine truths and invite believers into a deeper understanding of God's kingdom. The student's answer acknowledges the cultural context well but lacks a clear emphasis on the spiritual significance of Jesus' teachings using parables."
