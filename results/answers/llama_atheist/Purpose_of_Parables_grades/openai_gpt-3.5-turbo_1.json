  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned and insightful perspective on Jesus' use of parables within the historical and cultural context of ancient Judaism. The student effectively addresses the concern about understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith. However, the student's perspective as an atheist may overlook the spiritual significance of Jesus' parables in conveying divine truth to his followers, which is essential in a Christian worldview. Overall, the response is well-written and provides a comprehensive analysis."
