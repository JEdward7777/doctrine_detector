  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-reasoned analysis of Jesus' use of parables, incorporating historical and cultural context to understand the significance of this teaching method. However, the perspective presented leans heavily toward a secular, historical approach rather than considering the implications for faith and the divine nature of Jesus' teachings. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to address the specific concern about understanding Jesus' teaching methods in relation to faith from a Christian worldview, emphasizing the divine revelation and spiritual truths inherent in the parables."
