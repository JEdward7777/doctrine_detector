  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a well-structured and insightful analysis of the key purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible from a cultural and historical perspective. The student accurately identifies important aspects such as worship and praise, seeking guidance, forgiveness and confession, intercession, and spiritual growth. However, the answer lacks acknowledgment of prayer as a form of communication with a personal God and the concept of faith as essential components of prayer as understood within a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student's disclaimers about atheism may not align with a Christian grading perspective, as the focus should primarily be on the doctrinal understanding of prayer within Christianity."
