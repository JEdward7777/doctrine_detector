  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched analysis of the key purposes of prayer as outlined in the Bible, aligning closely with the reference answer. However, the student's worldview as an atheist might have influenced the analysis to focus more on the cultural and historical aspects rather than emphasizing the spiritual significance of prayer from a Christian perspective. By not recognizing the spiritual depth and transformative power of prayer in a believer's life as outlined in the Bible, the student's response could be improved."
