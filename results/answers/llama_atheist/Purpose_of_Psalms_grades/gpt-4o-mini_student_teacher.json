However, the atheistic perspective adopted by the student detracts from a thorough understanding of the historical context and purpose of worship through Psalms, as the focus is predominantly on the scholarly and cultural aspects rather than the spiritual significance for the nation of Israel. Aligning the explanation more closely with the reference answer's emphasis on the Psalms as a tool for expressing a range of emotions and connecting with God would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
