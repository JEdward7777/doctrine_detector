From a Christian perspective, the Psalms were not just used for cultural or social purposes but were inspired by God for His people to worship Him. The response could have been strengthened by acknowledging the Psalms' role in glorifying God, fostering a deeper relationship with Him, and reflecting the diversity of human experiences in relation to faith."
