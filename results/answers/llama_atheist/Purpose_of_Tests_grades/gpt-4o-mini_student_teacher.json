  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed analysis from various perspectives, the Christian-specific view of tests as a means to expose sin, repent, and grow closer to God is missing. The response lacks a fundamental understanding of the purpose of tests as defined within Christianity, which significantly impacts the overall evaluation of the answer. The student's analysis from sociological, psychological, and philosophical standpoints does not align with the Christian worldview presented in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
