  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed analysis of the concept of the soul in ancient Near Eastern cultures and its relationship to God as described in scripture. While the student's response is informative and well-researched, it lacks acknowledgment of the spiritual significance and accountability aspect emphasized in the reference answer. As a Christian, understanding the soul's role in relation to God goes beyond historical and cultural contexts to encompass a spiritual connection that influences one's spiritual life and moral decisions. Therefore, the student's answer, while insightful, falls short of fully addressing the concern from a Christian worldview."
