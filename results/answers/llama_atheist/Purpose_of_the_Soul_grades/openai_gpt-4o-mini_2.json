However, as an atheist viewpoint, it lacks acknowledgment or consideration of the influence the soul's connection to God may have on a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions, as specified in the concern. This perspective overlooks the significance of the soul in shaping beliefs, values, and actions within a Christian worldview."
