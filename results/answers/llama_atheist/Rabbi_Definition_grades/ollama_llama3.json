  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does not directly address the concern of understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament, but it does provide some relevant information about the meaning and usage of the term \"Rabbi\" in Christian tradition. The discussion of how Christian writers and theologians drew parallels between Jewish tradition and their own faith is particularly relevant to this concern.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more explicit connections to the New Testament and exploring the significance of rabbinic teaching within that context. Additionally, some of the information provided, such as the mention of certain Messianic Jewish or Hebrew Roots contexts, may not be directly relevant to understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament.\n\nOverall, while this response does provide some useful information about the term \"Rabbi\" in Christian tradition, it could benefit from more explicit connections to the concern at hand."
