It effectively addresses the concern by linking the significance of rabbinic teaching to the early Christian Church and highlighting the parallels drawn between Jewish tradition and Christian teachings. The response could be enhanced by further exploring specific examples of rabbinic teachings in the New Testament to deepen the analysis."
