However, it could have delved deeper into the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament specifically, rather than focusing mainly on the general usage of the term \"Rabbi\" in Christianity. More explicit discussion on how rabbinic teaching influenced early Christians and the teachings of Jesus would have enhanced the response."
