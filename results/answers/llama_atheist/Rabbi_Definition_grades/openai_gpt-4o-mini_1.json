The explanation of how the term is used in Christian settings, including specific denominational examples, demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, it could have been strengthened by providing more specific examples of rabbinic teachings found in the New Testament and their significance within Christian theology. Overall, a well-informed and thoughtful response."
