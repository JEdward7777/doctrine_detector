## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
The Temple in Jerusalem, a fascinating topic that has garnered significant attention throughout history! As an atheist scholar, I'll approach this inquiry with a focus on historical and archaeological evidence.

The First Temple, built by King Solomon (circa 970-930 BCE), was destroyed by the Babylonians under King Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BCE. This event marked the beginning of the Babylonian exile, where many Jews were forced to leave their homeland and settle in Babylon.

The destruction of the First Temple was largely due to a combination of factors:

1. Israel's idolatry: The Israelites had become increasingly devoted to worshiping other gods and goddesses, which led to a decline in faithfulness to Yahweh.
2. Assyrian and Babylonian invasions: The Assyrians (722 BCE) and later the Babylonians (586 BCE) conquered Judah, leading to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple.

After the Babylonian exile, the Persian Empire under Cyrus the Great (539-530 BCE) allowed the Jews to return to Jerusalem. In 520 BCE, Zerubbabel, a Jewish governor appointed by the Persians, led the effort to rebuild the Second Temple.

However, this initial attempt was not without challenges:

1. Opposition from local populations: The Samaritans, who had their own temple on Mount Gerizim, opposed the rebuilding of the Jerusalem Temple.
2. Lack of resources and expertise: The returned exiles lacked the skills, materials, and manpower necessary to construct a grand temple like the original.

Despite these obstacles, the Second Temple was eventually completed in 515 BCE under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah. While it wasn't as magnificent as the First Temple, it remained an important center of Jewish worship and culture for centuries.

In 70 CE, the Roman Empire under Titus destroyed the Second Temple, marking the end of the Second Temple period. This event was largely a consequence of the Jewish Revolt (66-73 CE), which was sparked by tensions between Jews and Romans over taxation and cultural differences.

The subsequent rebuilding of the temple is a complex topic that involves the Herodian dynasty, the Roman Empire, and later, the Byzantine and Ottoman empires. However, it's essential to note that the last Jewish Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, and no subsequent attempts were made to rebuild it.

As an atheist scholar, I believe that understanding the historical context and archaeological evidence surrounding these events is crucial for a nuanced comprehension of the temple's destruction and rebuilding.
