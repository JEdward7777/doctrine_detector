As a Christian, it is important to emphasize the theological implications of the Temple's destruction as a consequence of Israel's unfaithfulness and the later implications for the coming Messiah. Additionally, the role of the Temple in foreshadowing Christ as the ultimate sacrifice and the implications of its ultimate destruction in relation to the New Covenant could have been discussed further. A Christian worldview would also highlight the spiritual rather than just the historical importance of the Temple."
