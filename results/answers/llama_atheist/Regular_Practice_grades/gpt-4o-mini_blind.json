The student's hesitation to engage with theological justifications and their lack of emphasis on the sacrificial aspect of the Lord's Supper as a remembrance of Christ's atoning death weaken the overall analysis. A more robust exploration of the theological significance and scriptural foundations of the Lord's Supper would greatly improve the answer."
