  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed historical and cultural analysis of the establishment of the Lord's Supper, they missed addressing the core Christian belief and purpose behind it as highlighted in the reference answer. The importance of remembering and proclaiming Jesus Christ's death and resurrection is central to the Lord's Supper in Christian theology. The student's answer, although insightful, lacked emphasis on this foundational aspect."
