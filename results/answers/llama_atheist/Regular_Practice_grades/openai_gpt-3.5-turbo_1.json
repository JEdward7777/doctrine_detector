The focus on theological justifications and the significance of the ritual in reinforcing Christian identity and addressing social and economic issues within the early Christian community is lacking. The response could have been strengthened by emphasizing the spiritual significance of the Lord's Supper in the context of salvation through Christ's sacrifice and the importance of partaking in remembrance and proclamation of His death and resurrection for believers' faith and communion with God."
