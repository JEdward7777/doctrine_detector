While the historical and cultural background is valuable, a perspective rooted in the theological understanding of the Lord's Supper as a sacrament of remembrance and proclamation of Jesus Christ's sacrifice is vital for a holistic evaluation of its significance. The response could improve by highlighting the spiritual meaning and impact of the Lord's Supper on the church and individual believers from a Christian worldview."
