The focus on the social and cultural aspects is commendable, but a Christian worldview places importance on understanding the Lord's Supper not just as a ritual or cultural practice, but as a tangible expression of Christ's sacrifice for believers. Emphasizing the theological depth and spiritual nourishment aspect of the Lord's Supper would have been beneficial for a more holistic perspective."
