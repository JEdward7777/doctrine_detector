  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response gives a clear explanation of the terms \"propitiation\" and \"atonement\" and their connection within Christian theology. However, the student attempts to provide neutrality by separating the analysis from taking a stance on the validity or relevance of these concepts. In a Christian worldview, it is important to acknowledge the truth claims of these concepts as foundational to the faith. The response could be improved by affirming the doctrinal understanding of propitiation and atonement within Christianity without attempting to distance from their theological significance."
