  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough analysis of the concepts of propitiation and atonement within a Christian theological framework. They have demonstrated an understanding of the relationship between the two terms and how they function in the context of reconciliation between God and humanity. However, the student could have improved their response by explicitly mentioning the emphasis of propitiation on appeasing God's wrath, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the analysis provided is well-informed and thoughtful."
