  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God within biblical contexts. However, the student's decision to approach the topic from an atheistic perspective significantly undermines the doctrinal correctness required in grading from a Christian worldview. The explanation neglects to affirm the foundational belief in God's existence, His judgment, and the need for repentance for salvation. A more scripturally-based analysis is necessary to fully address the question from a Christian perspective."
