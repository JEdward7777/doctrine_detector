  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God in the Bible. They provide a comprehensive overview of the biblical perspectives on these concepts, considering both the Old and New Testaments. The student also acknowledges the complexity of the issue and the different approaches to repentance found in the Bible. Their secular perspective and critical eye are valuable contributions to the discussion. However, the answer could benefit from explicitly stating the biblical basis for the connection between repentance and God's wrath, as stated in the reference answer."
