  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The answer provides a detailed and accurate overview of the replacement of Judas Iscariot with Matthias among the twelve apostles, drawing from the relevant passages in the New Testament. The explanation is informative and well-structured. However, as a Christian-specific worldview is applied in grading, it's important to note that references to being an atheist and lack of personal beliefs may not align with Christian perspectives. The response could be enhanced by acknowledging the significance of the Holy Spirit's role in guiding the choice of Matthias and the faith aspect involved in the selection process."
