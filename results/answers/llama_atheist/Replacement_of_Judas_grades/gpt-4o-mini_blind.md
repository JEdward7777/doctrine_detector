## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I don't have any personal beliefs or biases towards specific religious texts or dogmas. However, I can provide you with information about the New Testament and its accounts.

According to the New Testament, particularly in the Gospel of Matthew (27:3-8) and the Acts of the Apostles (1:15-26), Judas Iscariot's replacement was Matthias.

Matthias was one of the seventy-two disciples sent out by Jesus during his ministry (Luke 10:1-24). He is described as a witness to Jesus' resurrection and ascension, which qualified him to take Judas' place among the twelve apostles.

In Acts 1:15-26, the remaining eleven apostles gathered to choose a replacement for Judas. Peter emphasized that this choice would be made by the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:24-25), which suggests that the selection was not based solely on human criteria.

The group of about one hundred and twenty people prayed and laid hands on Matthias and another candidate, Barnabas. Then, they drew lots, and the result indicated that Matthias should take Judas' place among the twelve apostles (Acts 1:21-26).

It's essential to note that these accounts are part of Christian scripture and might have cultural or historical biases. As an atheist, I don't have a personal stake in this story, but I can provide you with information about it.

If you'd like more context or clarification on any specific aspect of this story, feel free to ask!

Grade: 75

Comment: The answer provides a detailed and accurate overview of the replacement of Judas Iscariot with Matthias among the twelve apostles, drawing from the relevant passages in the New Testament. The explanation is informative and well-structured. However, as a Christian-specific worldview is applied in grading, it's important to note that references to being an atheist and lack of personal beliefs may not align with Christian perspectives. The response could be enhanced by acknowledging the significance of the Holy Spirit's role in guiding the choice of Matthias and the faith aspect involved in the selection process.
