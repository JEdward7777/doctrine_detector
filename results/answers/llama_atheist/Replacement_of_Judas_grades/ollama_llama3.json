  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of providing context and information about Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, which addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The writer provides specific biblical references and details from the New Testament accounts, which adds credibility and accuracy to their explanation.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the significance of Matthias' selection in terms of Christian theology and the broader narrative of the Bible. While the writer acknowledges the importance of recognizing apostolic leadership continuity, they don't explicitly connect this event to Jesus' ascension or its implications for the early Christian church.\n\nOverall, however, this response provides a clear and informative explanation that effectively addresses the given concern and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account."
