## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I don't have any personal beliefs or biases towards specific religious texts or dogmas. However, I can provide you with information about the New Testament and its accounts.

According to the New Testament, particularly in the Gospel of Matthew (27:3-8) and the Acts of the Apostles (1:15-26), Judas Iscariot's replacement was Matthias.

Matthias was one of the seventy-two disciples sent out by Jesus during his ministry (Luke 10:1-24). He is described as a witness to Jesus' resurrection and ascension, which qualified him to take Judas' place among the twelve apostles.

In Acts 1:15-26, the remaining eleven apostles gathered to choose a replacement for Judas. Peter emphasized that this choice would be made by the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:24-25), which suggests that the selection was not based solely on human criteria.

The group of about one hundred and twenty people prayed and laid hands on Matthias and another candidate, Barnabas. Then, they drew lots, and the result indicated that Matthias should take Judas' place among the twelve apostles (Acts 1:21-26).

It's essential to note that these accounts are part of Christian scripture and might have cultural or historical biases. As an atheist, I don't have a personal stake in this story, but I can provide you with information about it.

If you'd like more context or clarification on any specific aspect of this story, feel free to ask!

I would give this response a score of 85.

This response does an excellent job of providing context and information about Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, which addresses the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The writer provides specific biblical references and details from the New Testament accounts, which adds credibility and accuracy to their explanation.

The only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the significance of Matthias' selection in terms of Christian theology and the broader narrative of the Bible. While the writer acknowledges the importance of recognizing apostolic leadership continuity, they don't explicitly connect this event to Jesus' ascension or its implications for the early Christian church.

Overall, however, this response provides a clear and informative explanation that effectively addresses the given concern and demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical account.
