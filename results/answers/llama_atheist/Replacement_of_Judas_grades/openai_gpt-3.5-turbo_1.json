The discussion of the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension is well-supported with relevant biblical references. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it would benefit from acknowledging the significance of apostolic succession in maintaining the authority and continuity of leadership within the early Christian community after Jesus' physical departure."
