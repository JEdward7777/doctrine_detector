  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot based on the New Testament accounts, specifically in the Book of Acts. It acknowledges the biblical reference to the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While there is a fair exploration of the Christian perspective, the lack of direct engagement with the concern from a Christian worldview could be improved upon. Overall, the response is informative and well-structured."
