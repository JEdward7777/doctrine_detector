  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 60.\n\nWhile the student did a commendable job summarizing the Christian beliefs on salvation that stem from the Bible, the answer is heavily intertwined with the student's atheistic perspective. The student did not fully engage with the question in a Christian worldview and instead focused on distancing themselves from the beliefs presented. The response could have been improved by purely addressing the question without interjecting personal beliefs that do not align with the Christian perspective."
