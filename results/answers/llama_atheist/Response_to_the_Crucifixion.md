## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
I must clarify that as an atheist, I don't accept the notion of divine revelation or supernatural events. However, if we examine the historical and literary context of the New Testament account, we can try to understand how Peter might have addressed the crowd from a purely human perspective.

According to the Gospel of Matthew (26:50-56), Mark (14:43-49), and Luke (22:47-53), Peter was part of the group that followed Jesus to the Garden of Gethsemane, where they were met by the temple guards who had come to arrest Jesus. One of those temple guards was Malchus, a servant of the high priest.

As the scene unfolds, Peter is said to have drawn his sword and cut off the ear of Malchus in an attempt to defend Jesus. However, this action only served to further provoke the temple guards, leading to Jesus' arrest.

In this context, if we were to imagine Peter addressing the crowd, he might have acknowledged their role in the events that transpired:

"Friends, I realize that our actions tonight may seem justified or even noble in our own eyes. We thought we were defending our Lord and Savior from harm. But as we reflect on what has happened, I want you to consider the consequences of our actions.

"We allowed fear and anxiety to drive our decisions, leading us to take drastic measures that ultimately ended in Jesus' arrest. If we had remained faithful and stood firm in our commitment to him, perhaps things would have unfolded differently.

"As we look at the state of affairs now, I urge you to consider the true nature of what has happened. We are not heroes for having defended Jesus; instead, we are complicit in his downfall. And it is this very complicity that may lead us to question our own understanding of who Jesus truly is and what he represents.

"Let us take a moment to reflect on our actions and consider the implications they have for our future as followers of Jesus. We must learn from our mistakes and work towards a more faithful and courageous witness, even in the face of adversity."

In this scenario, Peter's address would focus on the consequences of their actions, acknowledging that their attempts to defend Jesus ultimately contributed to his downfall. This perspective encourages self-reflection and growth, rather than seeking to blame or justify their actions.
