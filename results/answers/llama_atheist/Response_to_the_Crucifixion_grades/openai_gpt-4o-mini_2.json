The response does not explicitly address the need for repentance and faith in God's saving work through Jesus' death and resurrection. While self-reflection and acknowledging one's mistakes are important aspects, a stronger emphasis on the call to respond to the gospel message would align more closely with Christian preaching in the early church."
