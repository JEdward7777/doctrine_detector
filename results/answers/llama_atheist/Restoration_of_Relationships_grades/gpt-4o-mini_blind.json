It dismisses the concept of God and divine restoration, which is fundamental to the question asked. From a Christian perspective, restoring sinful people back to God involves redemption through the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ on the cross. This answer misses the mark by discussing secular humanistic concepts of personal growth and transformation without addressing the theological significance of restoration in Christianity."
