It fails to recognize the foundational Christian belief in the necessity of divine intervention and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ for achieving reconciliation. The secular perspective on personal growth and self-awareness, while valuable in its own right, does not align with the Christian view regarding the significance of reconciliation through faith in Christ."
