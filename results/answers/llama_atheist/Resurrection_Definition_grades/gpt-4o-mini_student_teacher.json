  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the Christian concept of resurrection, including its significance in Christian theology and the historical context.

Additionally, the student's emphasis on methodological limitations and lack of empirical evidence does not align with the core beliefs of Christianity regarding faith and the supernatural."
