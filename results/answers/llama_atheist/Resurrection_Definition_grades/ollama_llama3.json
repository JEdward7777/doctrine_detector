  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately defines the concept of resurrection, which aligns with the provided answer. It also provides a good overview of the significance of the resurrection in Christian theology, including its connection to Jesus' divinity and God's power.\n\nFurthermore, the response acknowledges the historical-critical context of the resurrection narrative and raises important methodological concerns about faith-based explanations. The author's skepticism as an atheist is understandable given the lack of empirical evidence and inconsistencies between different accounts of the event.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response could be more nuanced in its understanding of Christian beliefs about life after death. While it mentions eternal life for believers, it would have been beneficial to explore this concept further or provide specific examples from Christian teachings. Additionally, some of the language used is quite general and could be more detailed.\n\nOverall, I appreciate the thoughtful and analytical approach taken by the author in addressing the concern. With a bit more depth and attention to specific Christian beliefs, this response would have earned an even higher grade."
