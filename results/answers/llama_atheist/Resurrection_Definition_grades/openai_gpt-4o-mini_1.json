However, the response undermines the significance of the resurrection by approaching it solely from an atheistic and skeptical standpoint. While it's important to consider different perspectives, the response could have engaged more respectfully with the Christian worldview in addressing the concern about understanding the fundamental concept of resurrection in relation to Christian beliefs about life after death."
