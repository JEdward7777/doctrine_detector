However, the response largely focuses on a critical analysis of the concept from an atheistic perspective, rather than directly addressing the concern about understanding the fundamental concept of resurrection in Christian beliefs about life after death. The response could benefit from incorporating more direct engagement with the Christian worldview and theological implications of resurrection."
