  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive exploration of the topic, offering various perspectives and biblical passages to support their analysis. However, the answer primarily approaches the issue from a neutral standpoint and lacks a clear affirmation of the Christian belief in God's wrath as a part of His justice and holiness, as well as a demonstration of His love and mercy through salvation. Incorporating a more explicit Christian perspective would strengthen the response."
