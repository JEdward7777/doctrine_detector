  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between God's love, mercy, and wrath. They effectively analyze various biblical passages and philosophical perspectives to offer a well-rounded exploration of the issue. The student's ability to articulate the distinction between God's judgmental aspects and His overall character is particularly commendable. However, the response would benefit from a more explicitly Christian perspective, engaging more directly with theological interpretations of God's wrath within Christian tradition."
