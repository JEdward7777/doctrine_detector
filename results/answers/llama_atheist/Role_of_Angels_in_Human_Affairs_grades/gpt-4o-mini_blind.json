  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides an analysis of how angels have been perceived in various biblical passages from a cultural and historical standpoint. While the student acknowledges their atheistic perspective, they still accurately identify the roles of angels as messengers, worshipers, guardians, intercessors, and exemplars based on biblical references. However, the grade is lower as the answer lacks a Christian worldview perspective and dismisses the existence of angels, which contradicts Christian beliefs. The focus on cultural and historical analysis, while informative, does not align with a Christian understanding of angels as real beings created by God to serve Him."
