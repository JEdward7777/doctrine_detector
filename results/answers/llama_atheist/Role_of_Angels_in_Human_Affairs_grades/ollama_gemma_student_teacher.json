They provide a comprehensive analysis of various roles attributed to angels in the Bible, including messengers, protectors, worshipers, intercessors, and exemplars. \n\nThe student also acknowledges the cultural and historical context of these depictions, which demonstrates an awareness of the limitations and biases inherent in biblical interpretations. \n\nWhile the student does not endorse the existence of literal angels, their cultural and historical analysis offers valuable insights into the symbolic and metaphorical significance of angelic figures in biblical narratives. This approach aligns with the concern expressed in the prompt about understanding divine intervention from a Christian worldview."
