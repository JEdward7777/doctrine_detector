However, the response falls short in addressing the concern regarding how understanding the roles of angels can impact Christian perception of divine intervention in their lives. While the analysis is informative from a secular standpoint, it doesn't fully engage with the Christian worldview and the significance of angelic roles in shaping faith and belief in divine intervention."
