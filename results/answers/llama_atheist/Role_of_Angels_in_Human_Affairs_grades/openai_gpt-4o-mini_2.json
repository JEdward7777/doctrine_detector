While the response acknowledges the biblical portrayal of angels as messengers and protectors, it falls short of addressing the concern from a Christian worldview. It lacks the recognition of angels as spiritual beings created by God to carry out His will and provide divine intervention in the lives of believers. From a Christian perspective, understanding the roles of angels is crucial in recognizing God's sovereignty and involvement in everyday affairs."
