However, the answer falls short from a Christian perspective as it approaches the topic from an atheistic viewpoint, neglecting the spiritual aspects and theological significance present in the apostles' teachings. The response lacks acknowledgment of the apostles' reliance on the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the importance of faith in Christ, and the foundational role of Jesus' teachings in shaping Christian community-building practices. It is crucial to integrate these doctrinal elements into the discussion to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the apostles' actions in relation to Christian beliefs and practices."
