  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and insightful analysis of the apostles' actions in teaching and fostering community among believers. However, the student's answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview and fails to address the concern of understanding community and teaching as integral aspects of church life as modeled by the apostles. The answer leans more towards a secular interpretation rather than a Christian one, missing the opportunity to integrate biblical principles and teachings into the analysis."
