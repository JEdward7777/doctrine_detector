  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the foundational aspects of teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer emphasized by the apostles, providing insightful analysis and practical applications for fostering community within and beyond religious contexts. The exploration of open dialogue, conflict resolution, and the importance of shared experiences adds depth to understanding community building in light of apostolic teachings. While the response acknowledges the transcendence of these principles across theological boundaries, a stronger Christian worldview integration in addressing the spiritual significance and divine guidance behind the apostles' actions would further enhance the analysis."
