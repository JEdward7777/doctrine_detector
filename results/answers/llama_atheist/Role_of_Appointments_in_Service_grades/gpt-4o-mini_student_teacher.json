  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer outlining various ways Christians are called to fulfill their roles within the Church. However, the answer lacks a focus on faithfulness, serving others, and advancing God's kingdom, which are key elements highlighted in the reference answer from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the perspective provided is from an atheist standpoint, which may not fully align with a Christian-specific worldview when addressing the responsibility of believers in their appointed tasks within the body of Christ."
