  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by outlining the various responsibilities believers have in their appointed roles within the body of Christ. It highlights the importance of serving others, using gifts for the edification of the Church, and advancing God's kingdom. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly tie these responsibilities back to serving God and seeking to glorify Him, which is central to fulfilling these roles as a Christian."
