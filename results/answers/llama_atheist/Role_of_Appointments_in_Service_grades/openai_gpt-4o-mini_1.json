  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the responsibility of believers in their appointed tasks and service within the body of Christ by outlining various roles Christians are called to fulfill based on their gifts, talents, and individual callings. The explanation provided is thorough and aligns well with Christian theology and ecclesiology. The integration of Bible verses supports the argument that Christians are called to serve others, use their gifts for the edification of the Church, and advance God's kingdom."
