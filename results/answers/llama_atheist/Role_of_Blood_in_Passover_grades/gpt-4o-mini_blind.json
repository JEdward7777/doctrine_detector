The absence of acknowledging the biblical understanding of the blood as a symbol of atonement, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, weakens the interpretation provided. Additionally, the perspective presented from an atheist viewpoint may not align with Christian beliefs and understanding of the Passover event. Further exploration into the biblical significance of blood and its connection to atonement and salvation would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
