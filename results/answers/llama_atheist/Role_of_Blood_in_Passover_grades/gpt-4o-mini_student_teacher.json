However, the student's response lacks a Christian-specific perspective on sacrifice and atonement, which are essential elements in understanding the Passover event within the Christian faith. The focus on atheistic reasoning and historical analysis detracts from addressing the concern of sacrifice and atonement in the Christian worldview."
