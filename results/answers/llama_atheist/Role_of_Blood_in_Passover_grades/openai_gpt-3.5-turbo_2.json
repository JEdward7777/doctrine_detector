The response does not acknowledge the Christian belief that the blood of the lamb on the doorposts foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the atonement for sin. This Christian-specific worldview is necessary to fully grasp the depth of meaning behind the Passover event and its connection to the Christian faith."
