  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the historical and cultural contexts of eunuchs in ancient societies. They provide detailed examples of eunuchs' roles in royal courts, temples, and households, highlighting their unique characteristics and the societal values and power dynamics associated with their positions. However, the absence of any reference to \"God's plan\" aligns with the student's secular perspective, which is appropriately stated at the beginning of the response. The conclusion appropriately emphasizes the cultural and historical contexts of eunuchs' roles, rather than imposing a theological interpretation."
