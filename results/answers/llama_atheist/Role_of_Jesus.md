## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of Christian theology! As an atheist, I'll do my best to provide a culturally nuanced answer that respects the traditions and beliefs of those who hold this faith.

In the New Testament of the Bible, Jesus is described as the central figure in human salvation. According to Christian doctrine, Jesus is seen as both fully human and fully divine, making him uniquely qualified to mediate between humanity and God.

The biblical narrative portrays Jesus as the Messiah (or Christ), sent by God to redeem humanity from sin and its consequences. The Bible teaches that through Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden, humans inherited a sinful nature and fell short of God's original intention for human beings. This state is often referred to as being "lost" or "separated" from God.

Jesus' role in salvation is multifaceted:

1. **Substitutionary Atonement**: Jesus is seen as the ultimate sacrifice, taking upon himself the punishment for humanity's sins. Through his death and resurrection, he paid the price for human sinfulness, thereby reconciling humans to God.
2. **Redemption**: Jesus' life, death, and resurrection are viewed as a rescue operation, where he freed humanity from the bondage of sin and its consequences (such as spiritual death and eternal separation from God).
3. **New Covenant**: Jesus is seen as the bridge between the old covenant (the law) and the new covenant (grace). Through his teachings, healings, and miracles, he ushered in a new era of redemption, where people could have direct access to God through faith.
4. **Intercessor**: As the mediator between humanity and God, Jesus is often depicted as interceding on behalf of those who put their trust in him. This intercession is seen as the means by which God's mercy and justice are balanced.

In summary, the Bible portrays Jesus as the savior who atoned for human sin, redeemed humanity from its sinful state, established a new covenant with God, and serves as an intercessor between humans and God. These roles are central to Christian theology and are often seen as the key to human salvation.
