It fails to acknowledge the Christian worldview of Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah. The response lacks recognition of Jesus' role in God's plan for humanity, as indicated in the concern. From a Christian perspective, Jesus' role as the Messiah is central to understanding God's plan for redemption and salvation, which this response overlooks."
