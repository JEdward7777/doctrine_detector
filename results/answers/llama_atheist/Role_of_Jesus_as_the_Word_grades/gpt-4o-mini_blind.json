  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a well-researched and informative response to the question, exploring the historical and philosophical context behind the title \"the Word of God\" ascribed to Jesus. The analysis of the term \"Logos\" and its significance in early Christian theology is thorough and insightful. From a Christian worldview, the response could be enhanced by emphasizing the unique Christian understanding of Jesus as the eternal Son of God who existed before creation and played a central role in the redemption of humanity through His sacrificial death and resurrection. Additionally, connecting the concept of the Word with Old Testament passages that foreshadowed Jesus' identity as the Word of God would deepen the theological reflection. Overall, a strong effort in addressing the question from a critical and secular perspective."
