It addresses the concern by clarifying Jesus' multifaceted role in redemption, emphasizing key aspects such as substitutionary atonement, redemption, the establishment of a new covenant, and Jesus as an intercessor. The inclusion of these elements enriches the understanding of Jesus' significance in Christian faith and salvation. However, as an improvement, it would be beneficial to further emphasize the unique role of Jesus as fully human and fully divine, highlighting the importance of his nature in facilitating salvation for humanity."
