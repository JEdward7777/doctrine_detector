  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of how Prophet Nathan utilized a parable in confronting King David. The answer effectively explains the use of the parable in challenging David's conscience and leading to his repentance. However, the inclusion of the perspective of an atheistic scholar detracts from the Christian-specific worldview required for this question, lowering the grade slightly. Overall, a strong understanding of the biblical narrative and the use of parables for correction and revelation was demonstrated."
