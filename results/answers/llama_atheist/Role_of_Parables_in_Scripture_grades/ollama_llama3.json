  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response successfully addresses the concern of understanding the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. The writer provides a clear and detailed explanation of Nathan's use of a parable to confront David about his sin, including a correct identification of the passage (2 Samuel 12:1-14) and an analysis of the parabolic strategy employed by Nathan.\n\nThe response also demonstrates a good understanding of the context and significance of the story, noting that Nathan's approach allowed him to address David's sin without directly accusing him. The writer also highlights the prophetic skill of Nathan in using storytelling to shape human behavior and moral understanding, which is relevant to the concern about the use of parables.\n\nThe only area where the response falls short is in its lack of depth and nuance in exploring the theological implications of Nathan's use of a parable. While the writer does acknowledge that the story \"served as a 'mirror' that reflected David's conscience,\" they could have gone further in exploring how this mirrors God's own revelation to humanity through Scripture.\n\nOverall, I would give this response an 85 out of 100 for its clear and detailed explanation of Nathan's use of a parable, its relevance to the concern about the use of parables, and its thoughtful analysis of the prophetic significance of the story."
