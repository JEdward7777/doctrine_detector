The writer effectively explains the strategic use of storytelling in the biblical narrative to challenge David's conscience and lead him to repentance. However, there is a slight deviation from a Christian perspective in the final paragraph where the writer, as an atheistic scholar, focuses more on the general power of storytelling rather than emphasizing the divine influence and moral implications specific to the biblical context."
