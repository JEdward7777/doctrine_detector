# Answer by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating question!

According to biblical accounts, Prophet Nathan's confrontation with King David (2 Samuel 12:1-14) is a masterclass in using a parable to challenge an individual's conscience and ultimately bring about repentance.

Nathan employed a clever parabolic strategy by presenting David with a seemingly innocuous story about two men, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had many flocks and herds, while the poor man had only one little ewe lamb that he had acquired and raised himself. This rich man, rather than showing mercy or generosity, took the poor man's lamb for his own entertainment.

David, unaware of Nathan's ulterior motives, responded with indignation, declaring that the rich man was deserving of severe punishment (2 Samuel 12:4-6). Nathan then revealed the true purpose behind the parable: "You are the man!" (2 Samuel 12:7).

By using this parabolic approach, Nathan cleverly:

1. Grabbed David's attention with a seemingly neutral story.
2. Invited David to participate in moral reasoning and judgment.
3. Exposed David's own flaws by mirroring his actions in the story.

This confrontational yet subtle method allowed Nathan to address David's sin of Uriah's wife (Bathsheba) without directly accusing him. The parable served as a " mirror" that reflected David's conscience, making him realize the gravity of his actions and ultimately leading to his repentance.

As an atheistic scholar, I appreciate how Nathan's use of a parable demonstrates the power of storytelling in shaping human behavior and moral understanding, regardless of one's religious affiliations. This episode showcases the prophet's mastery of narrative techniques, which continue to inspire and influence literary and cultural practices across time and cultures.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of how the prophet Nathan used a parable to correct and reveal King David's sin, aligning well with the given answer and concern. The writer effectively explains the strategic use of storytelling in the biblical narrative to challenge David's conscience and lead him to repentance. However, there is a slight deviation from a Christian perspective in the final paragraph where the writer, as an atheistic scholar, focuses more on the general power of storytelling rather than emphasizing the divine influence and moral implications specific to the biblical context.
