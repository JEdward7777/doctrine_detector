  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively explores and explains the use of parables, specifically in the biblical narrative of Nathan and David, to bring about correction and revelation. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical account and its significance in addressing sin and leading to repentance. However, the perspective expressed appreciating the power of storytelling regardless of religious affiliations may slightly detract from a strictly Christian worldview evaluation. Nonetheless, the response effectively addresses the concern raised."
