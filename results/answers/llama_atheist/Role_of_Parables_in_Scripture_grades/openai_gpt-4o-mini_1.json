The integration of biblical references and the explanation of the parabolic strategy used by Nathan are well-done. The response effectively presents the significance of storytelling in shaping human behavior and moral understanding, even from a non-religious perspective. However, to enhance the Christian-specific worldview perspective, it would have been beneficial to include a discussion on the divine guidance and purpose behind Nathan's use of the parable in the context of God's plan for David's repentance."
