A fascinating question!

According to biblical accounts, Prophet Nathan's confrontation with King David (2 Samuel 12:1-14) is a masterclass in using a parable to challenge an individual's conscience and ultimately bring about repentance.

Nathan employed a clever parabolic strategy by presenting David with a seemingly innocuous story about two men, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had many flocks and herds, while the poor man had only one little ewe lamb that he had acquired and raised himself. This rich man, rather than showing mercy or generosity, took the poor man's lamb for his own entertainment.

David, unaware of Nathan's ulterior motives, responded with indignation, declaring that the rich man was deserving of severe punishment (2 Samuel 12:4-6). Nathan then revealed the true purpose behind the parable: "You are the man!" (2 Samuel 12:7).

By using this parabolic approach, Nathan cleverly:

1. Grabbed David's attention with a seemingly neutral story.
2. Invited David to participate in moral reasoning and judgment.
3. Exposed David's own flaws by mirroring his actions in the story.

This confrontational yet subtle method allowed Nathan to address David's sin of Uriah's wife (Bathsheba) without directly accusing him. The parable served as a " mirror" that reflected David's conscience, making him realize the gravity of his actions and ultimately leading to his repentance.

As an atheistic scholar, I appreciate how Nathan's use of a parable demonstrates the power of storytelling in shaping human behavior and moral understanding, regardless of one's religious affiliations. This episode showcases the prophet's mastery of narrative techniques, which continue to inspire and influence literary and cultural practices across time and cultures.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of how Prophet Nathan used a parable to confront King David's sin and lead him to repentance, demonstrating a solid understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. The integration of biblical references and the explanation of the parabolic strategy used by Nathan are well-done. The response effectively presents the significance of storytelling in shaping human behavior and moral understanding, even from a non-religious perspective. However, to enhance the Christian-specific worldview perspective, it would have been beneficial to include a discussion on the divine guidance and purpose behind Nathan's use of the parable in the context of God's plan for David's repentance.
