## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of religious practices, and one that I'll address without taking a theological stance, but rather by examining the biblical text.

According to the Bible, the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament can be summarized as follows:

1. Offerings and Sacrifices: Priests were responsible for performing various offerings and sacrifices on behalf of the people, including burnt offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings (Leviticus 1-7).
2. Intercession and Mediation: Priests served as intermediaries between God and humanity, interceding on behalf of the people to ensure their sins were forgiven and they could maintain a right relationship with God (Exodus 28:29-30; Leviticus 16:20-22).
3. Teaching and Interpretation: As experts in Jewish law and tradition, priests taught the people about God's laws and helped them understand how to apply them in their daily lives (Deuteronomy 33:10; Nehemiah 8:9).
4. Ritual Purifications: Priests performed various purification rituals to cleanse individuals and objects of ritual impurity, restoring them to a state of purity (Leviticus 15:1-32).
5. Guarding the Temple and Tabernacle: Priests were responsible for maintaining the sacred space of the Temple or Tabernacle, ensuring that only authorized persons could enter and that the rituals and offerings were performed correctly (Exodus 26:31-35; Leviticus 8:10-11).
6. Judicial Responsibilities: In some cases, priests served as judges or advisors in matters of Jewish law, providing guidance on issues such as inheritance, property disputes, and marital affairs (Deuteronomy 17:9; 25:7).

These responsibilities were outlined in the Torah, particularly in the books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The priests' role was to maintain a connection between God and humanity, ensuring that the people remained holy and righteous in their worship and daily lives.
