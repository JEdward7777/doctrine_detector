  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate understanding of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament according to the Bible. They effectively referenced specific biblical passages to support their points and showcase a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The student's response aligns well with a Christian worldview and demonstrates a strong grasp of the biblical role of priests in the Old Testament. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly comparing their points with the reference answer provided by the teacher to ensure complete alignment."
