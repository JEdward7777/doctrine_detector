  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: While the response accurately summarizes some of the main responsibilities of priests, it lacks depth and specificity in addressing the biblical role of priests as outlined in the Old Testament. It does not mention crucial aspects such as intercession, mediation, ritual purifications, guarding the sacred space, and judicial responsibilities which are significant components of the priestly duties according to the biblical text. A more comprehensive explanation rooted in the biblical text would have strengthened the response."
