It effectively addresses the concern about understanding the biblical role of priests by referencing specific biblical passages and demonstrating a solid understanding of the various functions priests performed in ancient Israel. The response could have been enhanced by explicitly mentioning concepts like intercession, mediation, and ritual purifications, which are integral aspects of the priestly role in the biblical context."
