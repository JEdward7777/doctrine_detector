However, it lacks specificity in terms of the types of sacrifices and offerings priests were responsible for, the importance of intercession and mediation, and the overall significance of maintaining a connection between God and humanity as outlined in the biblical texts. More depth and detail in discussing the biblical role of priests would strengthen the response and align it more closely with a Christian worldview."
