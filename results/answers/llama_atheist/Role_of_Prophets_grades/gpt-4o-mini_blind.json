  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The answer provides a detailed analysis of the role of prophets in the Bible from a secular perspective, focusing on historical and cultural contexts. While the student acknowledges the traditional roles of prophets as messengers of God and advocates for social justice, the answer lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the prophetic role. Additionally, as a Christian-specific evaluation, the answer falls short in addressing the spiritual aspects of prophecy, such as the importance of repentance, obedience to God's commands, and the ultimate purpose of pointing people to Christ. Encouragement is given to incorporate a more biblical understanding of prophecy and the role of prophets to improve the response."
