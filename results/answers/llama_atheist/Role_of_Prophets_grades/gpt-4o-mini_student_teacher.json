  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed analysis of the biblical role of prophets from a historical and cultural perspective, they failed to address the primary role of a prophet according to the Bible, which is to speak God's messages to the people, often warning them to turn away from their sins and obey God. It is essential to focus on the central aspect of the prophet's role as outlined in the reference answer provided. This lack of alignment with the Christian worldview warrants a lower grade."
