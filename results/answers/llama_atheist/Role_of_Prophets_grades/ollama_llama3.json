  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response provides a good overview of the biblical role of prophets, highlighting their various functions such as intercession, conscience-keeping, vision, and rebuilding. The examples from the Bible, including Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Elijah, are relevant and help to illustrate these roles. Additionally, the response attempts to apply these principles to contemporary issues, promoting empathy, equality, and human flourishing.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the primary role of a prophet as described in the given answer. While it mentions that prophets often spoke God's messages, this is not developed further or connected to the biblical understanding of prophecy. As such, the response could be improved by more explicitly integrating the biblical concept of prophecy into its analysis.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some insightful observations and applications, it does not fully address the concern of understanding the biblical role of prophets and their messages."
