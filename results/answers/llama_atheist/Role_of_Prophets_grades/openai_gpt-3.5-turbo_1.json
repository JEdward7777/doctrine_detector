The response focused more on historical and cultural analysis, emphasizing social justice and moral responsibility from a secular standpoint rather than highlighting the divine aspect of prophecy. From a Christian perspective, prophets are seen as directly called by God to convey His messages and guide people back to Him, emphasizing repentance and obedience to God's commands. The response could have strengthened its analysis by incorporating more biblical references and emphasizing the divine authority behind prophetic messages."
