  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the prophetic role in the Bible from a secular perspective, considering historical and cultural context. It acknowledges the importance of prophets as messengers between God and humanity, highlighting key roles such as intercession, conscience-keeping, vision, and rebuilding. However, the grade is lower as the response does not fully align with the Christian worldview by failing to emphasize the key aspect of prophets speaking God's messages to the people, warning them to turn away from sin and obey God. The response also focuses more on secular interpretations rather than emphasizing the divine inspiration and authority behind the prophetic messages in the Bible."
