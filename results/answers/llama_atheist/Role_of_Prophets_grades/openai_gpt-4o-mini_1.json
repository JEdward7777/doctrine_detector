While it acknowledges the biblical view of prophets as messengers of God, it focuses more on the social justice aspect rather than primarily emphasizing the importance of delivering God's messages, warning people about sin, and calling them to obey God. From a Christian worldview, the role of prophets involves both social justice advocacy and delivering divine messages, which are foundational to understanding the biblical role of prophets. The response does not fully address this concern from a Christian perspective."
