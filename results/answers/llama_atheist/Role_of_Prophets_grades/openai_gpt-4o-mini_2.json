The response fails to engage with the validity and significance of God's messages delivered through prophets, particularly in terms of repentance and obedience to God. From a Christian worldview, the essence of the prophetic role is primarily to convey divine messages that call people to turn away from sin and follow God's will, which is central to understanding the biblical role of prophets."
