## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question about a group that, in my opinion, has been unfairly maligned by history and Christian tradition! As an atheist scholar, I approach this topic with a critical and nuanced perspective.

The Sadducees were a faction within Judaism during the 2nd century BCE to 1st century CE. They emerged as a prominent group in Jerusalem around 130 BCE and played a significant role in the Temple of Jerusalem's administration until its destruction in 70 CE. Here are their main responsibilities:

1. Temple Administration: The Sadducees were responsible for managing the daily operations of the Temple, including maintaining order, overseeing the priests' duties, and ensuring the proper functioning of the sacrificial system.
2. Priestly Functions: As a priestly faction, they were involved in the rituals and ceremonies performed within the Temple precincts. This included offering sacrifices, performing purification rites, and conducting other sacred functions.
3. Scriptural Interpretation: The Sadducees had a unique approach to biblical interpretation, focusing on the written Torah (the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) and rejecting the oral tradition and apocalyptic literature that would later become part of the Jewish canon. They believed in a more literal and straightforward understanding of scripture.
4. Judicial Authority: As a governing body within the Temple complex, the Sadducees had some judicial authority, handling disputes and settling legal matters related to temple affairs.

It's essential to note that the Sadducees were not necessarily opposed to the Pharisees (another prominent Jewish group during this period). While they disagreed on scriptural interpretation and other issues, their shared commitment to preserving Jewish tradition and maintaining Temple operations meant they often collaborated and even intermarried.

In my opinion, the Sadducees have been unfairly maligned by Christian sources, which often portrayed them as antagonists of Jesus or representative of a rigid, legalistic Judaism. A more nuanced understanding reveals a complex group that played an important role in Jewish temple life, even if their views on scripture and ritual diverged from those of other Jewish factions.
