  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer on the responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish temple system, demonstrating a good understanding of their historical context. However, the answer focused more on the scholarly perspective and the nuances of the Sadducees' role rather than directly addressing their main responsibilities as outlined in the reference answer. While the additional information provided depth to the response, it could have been more concise and directly related to the specific question asked."
