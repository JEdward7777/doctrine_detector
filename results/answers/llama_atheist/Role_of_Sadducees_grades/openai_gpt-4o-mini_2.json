The historical context was well explored, shedding light on the relationship between the Sadducees and other Jewish factions like the Pharisees. The response could have further emphasized the impact of the Sadducees' beliefs and practices on their interactions with Jesus and the broader religious landscape of the time, but overall, it demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic from a historical perspective."
