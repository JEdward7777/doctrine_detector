  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The student's response misses the mark by disregarding the foundational aspect of the Bible as God's inspired Word in illustrating the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message. Their approach to analyze the Bible solely from a secular and cultural perspective neglects the central role of divine revelation and authority in the transmission of the Gospel message. The absence of acknowledging the Bible as the primary source of truth and the ultimate authority in matters of faith significantly weakens the analysis provided. The student should have integrated the Christian worldview emphasizing the Bible's inherent nature of divine inspiration and the essential role of Scripture in conveying the Good News of salvation through Jesus Christ."
