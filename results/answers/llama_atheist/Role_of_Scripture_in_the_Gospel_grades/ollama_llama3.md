What a fascinating question! As an atheist, I must acknowledge that my perspective might differ from those who hold religious convictions. However, I'll attempt to provide an analysis of how the Bible illustrates the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message, without referencing any divine authority or supernatural claims.

From a cultural and historical context, the Bible can be seen as a significant literary work that has shaped Western civilization. Its role in shaping Christian theology, ethics, and moral values is undeniable. In this sense, the Bible serves as a foundation for many people's understanding of morality, ethics, and personal values.

The Bible's use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message can be understood through several lenses:

1. **Narrative structure**: The Bible employs a narrative structure to convey its message. The stories of creation, Noah's Ark, Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt, and Jesus' life, death, and resurrection provide a framework for understanding human nature, sin, and redemption.
2. **Quotations and allusions**: The Bible is replete with quotations and allusions to earlier texts, such as the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) or Greek philosophical works. This intertextual nature of Scripture highlights its connections to broader cultural and intellectual traditions.
3. **Rhetorical devices**: Biblical authors employed various rhetorical devices, like metaphors, allegories, parables, and proverbs, to convey their messages. These literary tools helped early Christian communities articulate and share the Gospel message effectively.
4. **Historical context**: The Bible's content must be understood within its historical context. The social, political, economic, and cultural conditions of ancient Israel, Greece, and Rome influenced the development of biblical narratives, laws, and wisdom literature.
5. **Influence on Western thought**: The Bible has had a profound impact on Western intellectual history, shaping ideas about morality, ethics, personal values, and social justice. Its influence can be seen in art, literature, philosophy, and even scientific inquiry.

By examining these aspects of the Bible's use of Scripture, we can appreciate its significance as a cultural artifact that has shaped human thought and behavior throughout history. While this perspective might not acknowledge any divine authorship or supernatural claims, it recognizes the Bible's importance as a literary work that has contributed to the development of Western civilization.

In sharing the Gospel message, Christians have often used biblical narratives and quotations to convey their beliefs about redemption through Jesus Christ. However, from a secular perspective, the Bible's influence on cultural values, ethics, and moral principles can be understood without referencing divine authority or supernatural claims.

This response attempts to provide an analysis of how the Bible illustrates the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message, but it does not directly address the concern of understanding the integration of Scripture in the communication of the Gospel. The provided answer is more focused on the cultural and historical context of the Bible's influence on Western civilization rather than the specific examples of followers of Jesus using Scriptures to share the Gospel.

The response does mention Philip and Paul, but it does not explore how they used Scriptures to communicate the good news about Jesus. Instead, it focuses on the broader impact of the Bible on Western thought and culture.

While the response is well-written and provides a solid overview of the cultural significance of the Bible, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of understanding the integration of Scripture in evangelism.
