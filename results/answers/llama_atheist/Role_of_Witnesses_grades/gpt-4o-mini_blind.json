  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and well-supported analysis of the role of witnesses in the New Testament regarding Jesus' life and resurrection. The student effectively highlights the diverse range of witnesses, including the apostles, women, Jewish leaders, and the Roman centurion, and their significance in establishing the authenticity of the events described. Additionally, the student acknowledges the importance of approaching the topic with an open mind, considering both theological and cultural contexts. The response could be improved by emphasizing the central theological significance of the resurrection in Christian belief and tying the role of witnesses more explicitly to the foundational aspects of the Christian faith."
