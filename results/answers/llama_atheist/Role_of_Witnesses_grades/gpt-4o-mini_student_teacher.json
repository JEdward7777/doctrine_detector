  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched analysis of the role of witnesses in the New Testament regarding Jesus' life and resurrection. They effectively highlighted the diverse range of witnesses and their significance in providing firsthand accounts. However, the response could have directly connected the role of witnesses to the importance of Christians bearing witness to their faith in a more explicit manner, aligning more closely with the concern provided. Overall, a strong response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a scholarly perspective within a Christian worldview."
