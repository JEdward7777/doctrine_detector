A question that requires a nuanced and contextually informed answer, free from supernatural assumptions!

In ancient Israelite society, the high priest (Kohen Gadol) held a position of significant authority and responsibility. Compared to other priests, the high priest had several unique duties and privileges.

1. **Annual Rituals**: The high priest was responsible for performing certain annual rituals, such as the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), which involved sacrificing animals to atone for the sins of the people.
2. **Tabernacle/Temple Maintenance**: As the highest authority in matters related to the Tabernacle or Temple, the high priest was responsible for ensuring its upkeep and maintenance, including tasks like trimming the menorah's wicks (Exodus 27:20-21) and performing special offerings (Leviticus 23:18).
3. **Supreme Spiritual Authority**: The high priest served as the chief spiritual advisor to the Israelite community, offering guidance on matters of ritual purity, ceremonial observance, and moral conduct.
4. **Representing the People**: As the highest representative of the people before God, the high priest would often intercede on behalf of the Israelites during times of national crisis or when seeking divine guidance (Exodus 30:10-15).
5. **Garment Symbolism**: The high priest's clothing held significant symbolic value, representing their role as mediator between the sacred and profane. Their garments were designed to distinguish them from other priests and emphasize their special connection with God.
6. **Unique Ritual Privileges**: The high priest had access to certain rituals and practices that were not available to other priests, such as entering the Holy of Holies (the innermost sanctum) once a year on Yom Kippur (Leviticus 16:17).

In summary, the high priest's unique responsibilities included overseeing annual rituals, maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple, serving as supreme spiritual authority, representing the people before God, wearing distinctive garments, and enjoying exclusive ritual privileges.

Please note that this answer is based on a non-theological, historical- cultural perspective, focusing on the social and ceremonial aspects of the high priest's role.
