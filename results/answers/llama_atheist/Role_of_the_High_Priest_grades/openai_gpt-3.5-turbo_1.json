It effectively addresses the concern by contextualizing the high priest's role within the worship practices of Israel. The only improvement could be a clearer connection to the specific role of the high priest in offering sacrifices for atonement, but overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a non-theological perspective. Great job!"
