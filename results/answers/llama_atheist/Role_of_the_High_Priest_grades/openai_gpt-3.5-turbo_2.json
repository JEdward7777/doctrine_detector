The emphasis on the high priest's unique responsibilities, such as overseeing annual rituals, maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple, and serving as the chief spiritual authority, aligns well with the concern regarding the high priest's role in worship practices. The response acknowledges that it is based on a non-theological, historical-cultural perspective, which is commendable for providing a comprehensive overview while acknowledging the limitations of a purely secular viewpoint."
