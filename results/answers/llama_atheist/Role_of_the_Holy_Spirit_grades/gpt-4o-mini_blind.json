  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the Christian perspective on the empowerment of a believer by the Holy Spirit after being born again. As a Christian worldview is the foundation of the question, the response fails to address it and instead provides a purely secular viewpoint, ignoring the theological framework essential to the topic. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and misses the mark in addressing the question from a Christian perspective."
