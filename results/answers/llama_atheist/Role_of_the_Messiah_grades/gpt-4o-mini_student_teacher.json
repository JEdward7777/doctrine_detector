  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer on the roles of the Messiah according to the Bible. They incorporated relevant biblical passages and demonstrated a clear understanding of the topic. However, the reference answer from the teacher simplifies the roles of the Messiah as a prophet, a priest, and a king, which is a more concise and focused explanation. The student's response, although detailed, could have benefitted from a more concise presentation to align closely with the teacher's reference answer."
