## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I must rely on historical and archaeological records to understand the practices of ancient societies, including the Israelites. The account of the Israelites' experience with manna can be found in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 16:22-30).

According to the text, God instructed the Israelites to gather enough manna for two days, but not on the sixth day, which would have been the eve of the Sabbath. This instruction was given so that the people could rest and observe the Sabbath as a holy day.

The biblical account states that the Israelites gathered twice as much manna on the fifth day than they needed for the next day's meal, in anticipation of not gathering any on the sixth day. This provision ensured that the people would have enough to eat and be able to observe the Sabbath without worrying about finding food.

In this way, God's instruction was designed to promote rest and observance of the Sabbath, while also providing for the physical needs of the Israelites.

Comment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of how God instructed the Israelites to gather manna in relation to the Sabbath, as well as the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands. The response provided relevant information from the biblical text and explained how God's instructions were designed to promote rest and observance of the Sabbath. However, the response could have been strengthened by directly quoting or referencing specific verses from the Bible to support the points made. Additionally, the response could have emphasized more explicitly the significance of obedience to God's commands regarding the Sabbath.
