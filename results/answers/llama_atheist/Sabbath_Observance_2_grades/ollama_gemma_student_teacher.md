## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I must rely on historical and archaeological records to understand the practices of ancient societies, including the Israelites. The account of the Israelites' experience with manna can be found in the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 16:22-30).

According to the text, God instructed the Israelites to gather enough manna for two days, but not on the sixth day, which would have been the eve of the Sabbath. This instruction was given so that the people could rest and observe the Sabbath as a holy day.

The biblical account states that the Israelites gathered twice as much manna on the fifth day than they needed for the next day's meal, in anticipation of not gathering any on the sixth day. This provision ensured that the people would have enough to eat and be able to observe the Sabbath without worrying about finding food.

In this way, God's instruction was designed to promote rest and observance of the Sabbath, while also providing for the physical needs of the Israelites.
