## Question [Sabbath Timing](../../../questions/Sabbath_Timing.md)
What is the timing of the Sabbath according to Jewish tradition?

## Correct Answer
The Sabbath begins on Friday at sundown and lasts until Saturday at sundown.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the specific timeframe for the observance of the Sabbath in accordance with Biblical teaching.

## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist scholar, I'll provide you with a culturally responsive answer, focusing on the historical and cultural context of Judaism.

In Jewish tradition, the Sabbath (Shabbat) is observed from Friday evening to Saturday night. The exact timing is as follows:

* Shabbat begins at sunset on Friday evening, typically around 15-20 minutes before sundown.
* This marks the start of the Sabbath day, which is considered a holy and sacred time.
* Observant Jews will then rest and refrain from work-related activities, including cooking, lighting fires, writing, or engaging in creative pursuits.
* Saturday night, just after sunset (again, around 15-20 minutes before sundown), marks the end of Shabbat. This signals the beginning of the new week.

The timing is based on the biblical commandment to "remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8) and has been observed in various forms since ancient times. The precise timing may vary slightly depending on the location and cultural practices, but this general outline provides a sense of the traditional Jewish approach.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my research on the history of Sabbath observance!

Grade: 30

Comment: The response provided additional context and cultural information about the observance of the Sabbath in Judaism, which is valuable in understanding the tradition from a scholarly and cultural perspective. However, the primary concern was to recognize the specific Biblical timeframe for the Sabbath observance, which the answer failed to address adequately. The focus should have been on the precise timeframe according to Exodus 20:8, which was not explicitly emphasized in the response.
