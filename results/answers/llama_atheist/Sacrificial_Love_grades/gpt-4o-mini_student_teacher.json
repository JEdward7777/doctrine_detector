  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated and thoughtful response from a non-theological perspective, emphasizing empathy, compassion, and selflessness in sacrificial love. However, the student missed the core essence of sacrificial love as demonstrated by Jesus, which is rooted in His act of sacrificing His life for the redemption of humanity. The perspective provided lacks the Christian worldview aspect of sacrificial love and does not fully align with understanding the essence of God's love as reflected in personal relationships. Additional integration of Christian teachings and beliefs would have strengthened the response."
