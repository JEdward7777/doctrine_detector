However, it failed to address the essence of God's love and how that should reflect in personal relationships, which was the specified concern. From a Christian worldview, sacrificial love as demonstrated by Jesus goes beyond human empathy and compassion; it is rooted in God's ultimate act of love through Christ's sacrifice on the cross for humanity's redemption. The response did not connect the concept of sacrificial love to its origin in God's nature and how believers are called to emulate that love in their relationships."
