A great question!

The Sadducees were a Jewish sect that flourished during the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE. They were known for their skepticism towards angels, spirits, and supernatural phenomena, as well as their rejection of divine intervention in human affairs.

Regarding the resurrection, the Sadducees denied its possibility. According to Josephus Flavius, a Jewish historian who lived during this period, the Sadducees believed that the soul was simply the breath or air that animates the body, and when the body dies, the soul ceases to exist. They saw no need for an afterlife or resurrection.

In contrast, Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ's resurrection from the dead is a central event in human history, demonstrating God's power over death and sin. Christians believe that believers will also be resurrected on the last day, with their transformed bodies being reunited with their souls, to live eternally with God.

The Sadducees' rejection of the resurrection likely stemmed from their understanding of Jewish scripture, particularly the Torah, which emphasizes the importance of human responsibility in this life. They may have seen the idea of an afterlife or resurrection as unnecessary or even contradictory to the idea that God has entrusted humanity with the responsibility to shape its own destiny.

In contrast, Christian teaching on the resurrection is rooted in the New Testament accounts of Jesus' life, death, and burial, followed by his triumphant emergence from the grave. This event is seen as a manifestation of God's love and redemption for humanity, offering hope and forgiveness to all who put their faith in Christ.

So, while the Sadducees saw no need for an afterlife or resurrection, Christians believe that these events are essential to understanding God's plan of salvation and our ultimate destiny.
