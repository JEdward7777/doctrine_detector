However, while it delves into the broader cultural and historical context, it does not directly address the specific concern regarding the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives. The response could have incorporated more explicit connections to how Samson's adherence to the Nazirite vow reflects his personal commitment to fulfilling God's purpose through his strength."
