However, the response primarily focuses on the implications of the Nazirite vow and does not deeply explore the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment in biblical narratives as specified in the concern. While the analysis is informative and well-structured, it could have delved more into how Samson's personal commitment to the vow reflects his understanding and fulfillment of divine purpose in the narrative."
