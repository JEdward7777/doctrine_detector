The student effectively connects Samson's adherence to the vow with his strength, showcasing the significance of personal commitment to a divine purpose. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications of divine guidance and accountability to God within the context of biblical narratives, drawing more explicitly on a Christian worldview."
