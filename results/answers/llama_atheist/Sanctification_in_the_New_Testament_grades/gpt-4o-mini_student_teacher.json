  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed analysis of the New Testament's description of sanctification and its process, they failed to address the concern of recognizing the role of faith in sanctification. As a Christian, faith is a crucial component in the sanctification process, as it is through faith in Jesus Christ that believers are sanctified and made holy. The student's response, though informative and well-structured, overlooked this fundamental aspect of sanctification from a Christian worldview."
