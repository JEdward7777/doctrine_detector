  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the New Testament's teaching on sanctification. They provide a comprehensive overview of the process, highlighting various aspects such as initial purification, ongoing effort, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the importance of scripture. \n\nHowever, the student's atheist perspective and emphasis on cultural contexts appropriately lowers the grade slightly, as it deviates from the Christian-specific worldview given in the prompt."
