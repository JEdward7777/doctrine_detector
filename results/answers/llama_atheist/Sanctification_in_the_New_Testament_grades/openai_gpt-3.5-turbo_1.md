A excellent question!

As an atheist scholar, I must emphasize that my response will focus on analyzing the biblical text without imposing any theological or metaphysical assumptions. In other words, I'll treat the New Testament as a literary and historical document, rather than a divine revelation.

Now, regarding your question about sanctification in the New Testament, it's essential to understand that the process is often linked to the concept of "holiness" or "set apart-ness." Here's how the NT describes this process for believers in Jesus:

1. **Initial Sanctification**: In 1 Corinthians 6:11, Paul writes that believers were "sanctified" (Greek: hagiazo) by Jesus' death and resurrection. This initial sanctification is often seen as a spiritual cleansing or purification, setting apart believers from the world's corruption.
2. **Ongoing Sanctification**: The process of sanctification is not limited to the moment of salvation. In 1 Thessalonians 4:3-8, Paul urges believers to "abstain from sexual immorality" and live a life pleasing to God. This passage highlights the need for ongoing effort to maintain one's spiritual purity.
3. **The Holy Spirit's Work**: The Holy Spirit plays a crucial role in sanctification (Romans 15:16; Philippians 2:12-13). Through the Spirit, believers are empowered to live according to God's will and conform to Jesus' image (Galatians 5:16-25).
4. **Mortification of Sin**: The process of sanctification also involves mortifying sin (Romans 6:1-14; Colossians 3:5-11). Believers are called to put to death sinful desires and behaviors, as they increasingly conform to Jesus' likeness.
5. **Growing in Holiness**: The NT emphasizes the importance of spiritual growth and maturity. In 2 Corinthians 7:1, Paul encourages believers to cleanse themselves from every form of impurity. This emphasis on holiness is often linked to the concept of "becoming more like Christ" (Ephesians 4:13-14).
6. **The Role of Scripture**: The Bible plays a significant role in sanctification, as it provides guidance and instruction for believers (Psalm 19:7-11; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). Through the Word, believers can understand God's will and receive wisdom for living a holy life.
7. **The Goal of Sanctification**: The ultimate goal of sanctification is to become like Jesus Christ. In Romans 8:29, Paul writes that believers are "predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son." This process of becoming like Jesus is described as the culmination of sanctification.

In summary, the NT describes sanctification as a multifaceted process involving initial purification, ongoing effort, the Holy Spirit's work, mortification of sin, growing in holiness, the role of Scripture, and the goal of becoming like Jesus Christ. As an atheist scholar, I must emphasize that these concepts are rooted in ancient Jewish and Mediterranean cultural contexts, which should be considered when interpreting the text.

Comment: While the response provides a thorough analysis of sanctification in the New Testament from an academic and historical perspective, it falls short of recognizing the fundamental role of faith in the process of sanctification as stated in the given answer. The Christian worldview emphasizes that sanctification is a work of God through faith in Jesus Christ, not merely a cultural or literary concept. It is crucial to acknowledge and incorporate this central aspect of faith in any discussion of sanctification from a Christian perspective.
