However, it failed to address the concern regarding the role of faith in the process of sanctification. The Christian worldview emphasizes that faith in Jesus is essential for sanctification, as belief in Him is the foundation for receiving God's sanctifying grace. Ignoring this crucial aspect significantly impacts the accuracy and completeness of the analysis."
