  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of sanctification in the New Testament from a purely academic perspective, addressing various aspects such as initial sanctification, ongoing sanctification, the role of the Holy Spirit, mortification of sin, growing in holiness, the importance of Scripture, and the ultimate goal of becoming like Jesus Christ. However, it fails to fully address the concern of recognizing the role of faith in the process of sanctification as stated in the given answer. While the response acknowledges the importance of belief in Jesus for sanctification, it primarily focuses on aspects like effort, spiritual growth, and cultural contexts. To improve the grade, the response could explicitly emphasize the foundational role of faith in the process of sanctification as taught in the New Testament."
