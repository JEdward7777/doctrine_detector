## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholarly individual, I'll approach this question from a historical and cultural perspective, without making any assumptions about supernatural or divine entities.

In the context of the Bible, "sanctuary" (Hebrew: קֹדֶשׁ, kodesh; Greek: ἅγιον, hagion) refers to a sacred or holy place. This term is often used to describe the most sacred area within the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, which was considered the dwelling place of God's presence.

In biblical times, the concept of sanctuary was deeply rooted in Jewish culture and tradition. The Ark of the Covenant, which housed the Ten Commandments, was placed in the innermost sanctum of the Temple, symbolizing God's direct involvement with humanity. This sacred space served as a focal point for worship, sacrifice, and communion between God and his people.

The sanctuary also represented a physical and symbolic separation from the profane or ordinary world. It was a place where priests and Levites performed rituals, offered sacrifices, and mediated between God and humans. The sanctuary's walls, curtains, and furnishings were meticulously designed to reflect the glory of God and create an atmosphere of reverence and awe.

In broader biblical contexts, the term "sanctuary" can also refer to:

1. The Garden of Eden, which was God's original sacred space on earth.
2. The Promised Land, which was considered a sanctuary or holy place for the Israelites.
3. Heaven or the throne room of God, where divine judgment and mercy are exercised.

In all these contexts, the concept of sanctuary conveys a sense of reverence, respect, and awe for a higher power or sacred reality.
