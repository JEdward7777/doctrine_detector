  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and informative answer on the term \"sanctuary\" in the Biblical context from a historical and cultural perspective. The answer showcases a good understanding of the significance of the sanctuary in Jewish culture and tradition. However, the student's answer lacks the acknowledgment of the divine aspect and the role of God in sanctifying the sanctuary, which is crucial from a Christian worldview. The answer could be improved by incorporating the teacher's reference answer that highlights the sacredness imparted by God to the sanctuary."
