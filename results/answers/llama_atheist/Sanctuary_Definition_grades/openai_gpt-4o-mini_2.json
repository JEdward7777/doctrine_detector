  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a well-researched and detailed explanation of the term \"sanctuary\" in the Biblical context, offering historical and cultural insights. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the term's significance and its various applications in different biblical settings. However, the response's emphasis on a purely historical and cultural perspective without acknowledging the supernatural or divine elements might limit a comprehensive understanding from a Christian worldview perspective. Incorporating insights on God's involvement in sanctuaries and the spiritual significance would have enhanced the response further."
