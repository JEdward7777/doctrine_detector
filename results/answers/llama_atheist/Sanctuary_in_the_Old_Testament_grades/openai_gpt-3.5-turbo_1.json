However, the response lacks acknowledgement or discussion of the Christian perspective of the sanctuary as a place where God dwells among His people and provides safety. As a Christian, it is important to recognize the sanctuary as not only a symbol of divine presence and guidance but also as a tangible representation of God's protection and refuge for His people."
