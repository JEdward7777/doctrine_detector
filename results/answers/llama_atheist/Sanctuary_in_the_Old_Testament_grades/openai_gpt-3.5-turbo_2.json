It effectively illustrates the significance of the sanctuary as a symbol of God's presence and provision for His people within the Hebrew Bible. However, it falls short of directly addressing the specific concern raised regarding the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people. The response could have strengthened its argument by more explicitly connecting the described aspects of the sanctuary to the concept of God dwelling among His people and providing them with safety."
