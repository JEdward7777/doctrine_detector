  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed exploration of how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament, addressing various aspects such as holiness, covering, purification, guidance, and rest. However, the response lacks a clear focus on the specific concern provided, which emphasized the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people. While the content is informative and well-researched, it does not directly align with the concern given in the grading criteria."
