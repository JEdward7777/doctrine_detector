  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: The response provides some relevant Bible verses that touch on the practice of interceding for others, which is commendable. However, there are some inaccuracies and misinterpretations in the explanations provided for each verse. Additionally, the response lacks a clear Christian worldview perspective and a deeper theological understanding of intercession in the Bible. Remember to focus on accurately interpreting and applying the Scriptures within the context of Christian beliefs."
