However, the response could be improved by focusing more directly on specific verses that specifically address interceding for others, such as those listed in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Encouraging the student to delve deeper into scriptural references that directly highlight the practice of intercession would enhance the overall understanding and application of this important aspect of prayer in a Christian worldview."
