  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided is strong in demonstrating cultural significance of intercession and applying it to everyday life, but falls short in specifically referencing the requested Bible verses. While it does mention some relevant passages like Hebrews 7:25, it fails to include other important verses mentioned in the answer (Isaiah 53:12, Jeremiah 29:6-7, Romans 8:26-27, and Romans 8:33-34). Additionally, it would be beneficial for the response to further emphasize the importance of Scripture in guiding believers in their prayer and intercession practices. Nevertheless, the response does a good job highlighting the role of intercession in various aspects of life, making it a valuable contribution to the concern at hand."
