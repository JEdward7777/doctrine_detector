  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This is a very thorough and well-supported answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of propitiation in Christian theology. The student effectively uses both Old Testament and New Testament passages to showcase the continuity of this concept throughout the Bible. The references to the Hebrew and Greek words add depth to the explanation. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
