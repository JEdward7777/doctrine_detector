  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive answer supported by relevant biblical passages from both the Old and New Testaments that connect the theological concept of propitiation with biblical references. The explanation of the Hebrew and Greek words adds depth to the understanding of propitiation in the context of sacrifice. However, the student could improve their answer by focusing more on the key verses highlighted in the reference answer for a more concise and targeted response."
