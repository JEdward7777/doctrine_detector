## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
The concept of propitiation, which I will define as a sacrifice or offering that appeases divine wrath or anger towards humanity, is a central theme in Christian theology. Several Bible passages support this idea.

Firstly, let's consider Leviticus 1:4-5, where the Lord commands Moses to instruct the Israelites on how to offer sacrifices to Him:

"'This is how you are to offer the offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the Lord: At the entrance to the tent of meeting you are to present what you have prepared and offer it in obedience to me; it will be very pleasing to me...The priest shall take some of its blood and put it on all sides of the altar, and at the base of the altar."

Here, the Hebrew word "nichach" (נִחַח) means "to pacify" or "to appease," indicating that the sacrifice is intended to soothe God's anger. Similarly, Leviticus 8:15-21 describes the consecration of Aaron and his sons as priests, where they are offered as a pleasing aroma before the Lord.

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is often seen as the ultimate propitiatory offering. Consider Romans 3:25-26:

"God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood, to demonstrate his justice because of the suffering of one who knew no sin. And he will dwell with us, even though we are guilty and wicked people."

In this passage, Paul uses the Greek word "hilasterion" (ἱλαστήριον), which means "mercy seat" or "place of propitiation," to describe Jesus as the sacrifice that atones for human sin. This concept is further emphasized in Hebrews 9:1-10 and 12-15, where Christ's sacrifice is seen as a new covenant offering that cleanses people from their sins.

Finally, 1 John 2:2 says:

"He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world."

Here, John explicitly calls Jesus "the propitiation" (Greek: ἱλαστήριον) for humanity's sins, emphasizing His role as a sacrifice that appeases divine wrath.

These biblical passages demonstrate that the concept of propitiation is rooted in both the Old and New Testaments.
