  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90 \n\nComment: The response effectively connects the theological concept of propitiation with relevant biblical references for deeper understanding. It provides clear explanations of the key verses mentioned and also includes additional supporting passages from both the Old and New Testaments to strengthen the argument. The use of Greek and Hebrew terms adds depth to the analysis. Overall, a well-researched and well-supported response from a Christian worldview perspective."
