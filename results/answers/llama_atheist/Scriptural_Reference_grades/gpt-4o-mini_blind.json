  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of key biblical passages addressing the concept of \"the world\" in relation to believers. The explanations were generally accurate and aligned with Christian theology, highlighting important nuances in different passages. However, there were a few areas where the responses could have been strengthened by providing more depth or clarity in connecting the passages to the broader theological implications. Overall, a solid effort in addressing the question."
