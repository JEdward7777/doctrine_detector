  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful answer, delving into multiple key biblical passages that address the concept of the \"world\" in relation to believers. They effectively explained the significance of each passage and how it relates to believers navigating a world characterized by ungodly values. The student's analysis demonstrated a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. However, the reference answer from the teacher also highlighted additional key passages that the student did not include in their response, which is why a slight deduction in grade was made. Overall, a well-researched and well-written answer."
