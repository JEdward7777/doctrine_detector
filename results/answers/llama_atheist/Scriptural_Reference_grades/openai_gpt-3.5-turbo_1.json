  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed and insightful exploration of key biblical passages related to believers and their relationship with the world. It effectively addresses the concern of navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values by highlighting relevant passages and discussing their implications for believers. The response could be strengthened by more directly connecting the analysis of the passages to practical guidance for believers facing ungodly values in the world. Overall, well done in integrating Christian theology and biblical wisdom into the discussion."
