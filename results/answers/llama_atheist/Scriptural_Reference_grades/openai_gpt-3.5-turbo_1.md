## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A great question that allows us to dive into the complexities of the biblical narrative!

In Christian theology, the concept of the "world" (Greek: kosmos) is often understood as the creation of God, encompassing all things that exist. However, within this broader understanding, there are various nuances and emphases in different passages.

Here are some key biblical passages that address the concept of the world in relation to believers:

1. John 3:16-17 - This iconic passage highlights Jesus' message of salvation: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. What a wonderful gift! And this is the verdict: light has come into the world, but people have preferred darkness to itâ€”because they loved their sin more than my praise."

In this context, "the world" refers to humanity as a whole, emphasizing God's love for all people and His desire to save them from perishing.

2. John 1:9-10 - The Prologue of the Gospel of John describes Jesus as the true Light who came into the world (Greek: eis ton kosmon): "The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not know him."

This passage highlights the contrast between God's revelation in Jesus Christ and the darkness of human ignorance.

3. 1 John 2:15-17 - The apostle John warns believers about being conformed to the world (Greek: tou kosmou) rather than living according to God's will: "Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for Father is ruined. And everything has become clear in him. Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared."

Here, John encourages believers to separate themselves from the world's values and pursuits.

4. Ephesians 2:1-3 - Paul writes about our former lives in the world (Greek: ton kosmon) before we were saved by faith in Christ: "As for you, you were separated from God when your ancestors disobeyed him. Because of that disobedience, all people have become his enemies. But God has now shown you his great love for you in this way: while you were still sinners, he took the initiative and reconciled us to himself through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ."

This passage highlights our connection to the world's rebellion against God before we were redeemed.

5. 1 Corinthians 7:29-31 - Paul advises believers not to be bound by the world (Greek: tou kosmou) or its desires: "What do you have that you did not receive? And if indeed you received it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it? But now I am writing this to each of you, rather than to judge you about things in which you are already made guilty by the law. For when I came to preach God's good news to you Gentiles, my message was not attractive or impressive."

Here, Paul emphasizes the believer's freedom from the world and its desires.

These passages illustrate the various ways the biblical authors understood the concept of "the world" in relation to believers.
