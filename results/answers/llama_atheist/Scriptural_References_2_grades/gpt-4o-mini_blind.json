  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-researched overview of biblical passages related to the concept of the Day of Judgment. They have accurately referenced relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments and highlighted key themes and cultural significance. The inclusion of different perspectives on the concept of the Day of Judgment adds depth to the response. However, it would have been even stronger if there was a clearer connection made to the atonement through Jesus' sacrificial death on the Cross as a central aspect of Christian belief regarding judgment and salvation."
