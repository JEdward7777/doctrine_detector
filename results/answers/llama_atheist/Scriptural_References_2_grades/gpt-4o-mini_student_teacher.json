  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response is well-researched and provides a comprehensive overview of biblical passages related to the Day of Judgment from both the Old and New Testaments. They have included key themes and highlighted the cultural significance of the concept. However, the student missed referencing the specific passages mentioned in the teacher's answer, which could have strengthened their response. Overall, it is a thoughtful and informative answer but could have been improved with direct reference to the passages provided by the teacher."
