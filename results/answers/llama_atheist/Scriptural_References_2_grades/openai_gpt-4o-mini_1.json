  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and comprehensive overview of biblical passages related to the concept of the Day of Judgment, addressing key themes, general references, and cultural significance. The inclusion of Old and New Testament passages, along with explanations and cultural implications, demonstrates a deep understanding of scripture related to judgment and effectively reinforces the scriptural basis for beliefs in this regard. The only improvement could be incorporating the additional key passages mentioned in the concern throughout the response."
