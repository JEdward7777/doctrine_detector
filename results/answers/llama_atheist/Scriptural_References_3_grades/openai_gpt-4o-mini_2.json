The analysis of hidden corruption, subtle manifestation, and heart-based morality enriches the understanding of the passage. However, the viewpoint presented is from an atheistic perspective, which detracts from the Christian-specific interpretation required. Encouraging a deeper exploration of the implications for Christians in pursuing genuine holiness could strengthen the response in aligning with the specified concern from a Christian worldview."
