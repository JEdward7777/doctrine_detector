It approaches the topic from an atheistic perspective, which doesn't align with a doctrinally correct interpretation of the Scriptures. The focus on cultural and historical context is informative but misses the crucial spiritual and theological dimensions that are central to understanding the concept of birthright in the Bible. Additionally, the absence of scriptural references or discussions on the covenantal aspects of birthright diminishes the depth of analysis required from a Christian worldview."
