However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the response falls short in not explicitly acknowledging the divine aspect of birthright as part of God's plan and the importance of holiness in relation to spiritual inheritance. The interpretation could have been strengthened by highlighting the overarching theme of God's sovereignty and the necessity of living a life in accordance with His will as crucial aspects of understanding birthright within Christian beliefs."
