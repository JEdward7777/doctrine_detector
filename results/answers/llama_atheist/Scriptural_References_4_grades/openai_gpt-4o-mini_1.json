However, the focus on atheistic perspective and cultural/historical context may not align perfectly with a Christian worldview. The response could have further emphasized the importance of God's plan, holiness, and the spiritual implications of birthright in a more explicitly Christian manner. The interpretation of the passages is well-done, but the integration of a Christian perspective could have been more prominent."
