However, as an atheistic scholar, the interpretation lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the significance of birthright within God's plan and the implications for contemporary Christian life. Incorporating this perspective would have strengthened the response and provided a more holistic understanding of the topic from a Christian viewpoint."
