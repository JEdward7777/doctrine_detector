  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed analysis of the shift in understanding of Hades in the New Testament, considering historical and cultural contexts. They cited relevant verses and offered explanations for the shift towards associating Hades with punishment for the unrighteous. However, the response lacked focus and clarity compared to the reference answer. Additionally, the student's atheistic perspective may have influenced their analysis, leading to a broader exploration of influences rather than a direct examination of biblical evidence. Focusing more on the specific verses highlighting the shift would have strengthened their argument."
