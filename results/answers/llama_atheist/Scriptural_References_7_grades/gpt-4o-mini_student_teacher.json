  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-analyzed and articulate response to the question, connecting the biblical principles of humility and exaltation in the life of believers to the verses in 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11. While the student's answer is comprehensive and thoughtful, it includes unnecessary commentary on their personal beliefs as an atheistic scholar, which detracts from focusing purely on the biblical analysis from a Christian worldview. This detracts slightly from the overall effectiveness of the response in addressing the concern in a Christian specific manner."
