  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical passages and their relevance to the concept of exaltation in the Christian faith. However, the response lacks a deeper engagement with the Christian worldview and fails to fully address the concern of connecting biblical principles of humility and exaltation in the life of believers. The student's secular perspective and lack of theological knowledge limit the depth and applicability of their analysis."
