However, the response from an atheistic perspective lacks recognition of the divine aspect of God exalting Jesus above all names. It also misses the crucial point of connecting these principles to the life of believers in a meaningful way, as it focuses more on a scholarly analysis rather than practical application within a Christian worldview."
