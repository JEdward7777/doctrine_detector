# Answer by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that requires a nuanced response, free from the shackles of dogmatic thinking! As an atheistic scholar, I shall endeavour to provide an answer that is grounded in cultural context and historical analysis.

In 1 Peter 5:5-7, we find Jesus being described as an example for believers. The passage reads: "You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you clothe yourselves with humility, clothed with mildness, and meekness, with quietness and gentleness, each one looking carefully how he conducts himself." The verse goes on to say that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. This passage highlights Jesus' exaltation through his humility.

In Philippians 2:9-11, we find a description of Jesus being exalted as Lord by the Father. The passage reads: "Therefore God has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who will not willingly subject themselves to Him, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

In both passages, we see a theme of exaltation. In 1 Peter, it is Jesus' humility that leads to his exaltation. He sets an example for believers to follow, demonstrating the power of humility in the face of persecution and suffering.

Philippians highlights Jesus' exaltation as Lord by the Father, where he is given a name that is above every name, and all creation will one day bow to him.

These passages illustrate the concept of exaltation in the Christian faith through the lens of Jesus Christ. His humility and obedience led to his exaltation, which serves as an example for believers to follow.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides a thorough analysis of how biblical passages such as 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11 illustrate the principles of humility and exaltation in the Christian faith. However, the response from an atheistic perspective lacks recognition of the divine aspect of God exalting Jesus above all names. It also misses the crucial point of connecting these principles to the life of believers in a meaningful way, as it focuses more on a scholarly analysis rather than practical application within a Christian worldview.
