There is a clear demonstration of the connection between the biblical principles of humility and exaltation for believers. However, the response could have delved deeper into how believers are called to emulate Christ's example of humility leading to exaltation in their own lives. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, acknowledging Jesus as Lord is essential in understanding the exaltation aspect in Philippians 2:9-11."
