However, the interpretation lacking a Christian specific worldview by not acknowledging Jesus as the Son of God and Savior. It also fails to explicitly link the biblical principles of humility and exaltation to the life of believers in a Christian context. It is important to understand these principles as central to the Christian faith, ultimately pointing towards the redemptive work of Christ for believers."
