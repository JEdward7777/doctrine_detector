## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that requires a careful examination of the biblical text! As an atheist scholar, I must approach this inquiry with a critical and nuanced perspective.

The reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham can be found in the book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 17. In verse 1, it is written: "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him as he was sitting at the entrance to a cave at Mamre, which is in Hebron."

In this passage, God reveals himself to Abram (later renamed Abraham) and promises to establish an everlasting covenant with him. This covenant includes a commandment for Abram to circumcise himself and all male members of his household, which serves as a sign of the covenant.

The phrase "Almighty" is not explicitly used in Genesis 17:1, but it can be inferred through the context and the concept of God's absolute power and authority. As an atheist scholar, I must acknowledge that this passage reflects the cultural and religious beliefs of the ancient Israelites, who viewed God as a powerful and all-knowing deity.

However, from my perspective, the term "Almighty" is not an objective description but rather a subjective expression of faith and devotion. The concept of an almighty God can be seen as a product of human imagination and cultural conditioning, shaped by historical events and social norms.

In conclusion, while Genesis 17:1 does not explicitly contain the phrase "Almighty," it sets the stage for the biblical narrative's portrayal of God's power and authority. As an atheist scholar, I approach this text with a critical eye, recognizing that it reflects the cultural and religious beliefs of ancient Israelites, which may or may not align with my own perspective on the nature of reality.

Grade: 30/100

Comment: The response falls short in providing a correct and thorough biblical answer to the question. It correctly identifies the book of Genesis as the source of the reference but fails to mention the specific chapter or verse where God is referred to as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham. Additionally, the student's perspective as an atheist scholar leads to a misinterpretation of the text and a dismissal of the divine nature of God as portrayed in the Bible. The answer lacks doctrinal correctness and misunderstands the significance of the term "Almighty" in a Christian worldview.
