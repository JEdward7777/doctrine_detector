  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a thorough and well-reasoned response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical text and the concept of God's power and authority. While the student's atheist perspective challenges the traditional interpretation of the text, their analysis is insightful and respectful of the religious beliefs of others. However, the grade could be improved by providing a more direct answer to the question and engaging more fully with the concern about deepening the connection to Scripture and God's promises."
