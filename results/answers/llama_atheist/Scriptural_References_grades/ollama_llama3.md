## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that requires a careful examination of the biblical text! As an atheist scholar, I must approach this inquiry with a critical and nuanced perspective.

The reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham can be found in the book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 17. In verse 1, it is written: "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him as he was sitting at the entrance to a cave at Mamre, which is in Hebron."

In this passage, God reveals himself to Abram (later renamed Abraham) and promises to establish an everlasting covenant with him. This covenant includes a commandment for Abram to circumcise himself and all male members of his household, which serves as a sign of the covenant.

The phrase "Almighty" is not explicitly used in Genesis 17:1, but it can be inferred through the context and the concept of God's absolute power and authority. As an atheist scholar, I must acknowledge that this passage reflects the cultural and religious beliefs of the ancient Israelites, who viewed God as a powerful and all-knowing deity.

However, from my perspective, the term "Almighty" is not an objective description but rather a subjective expression of faith and devotion. The concept of an almighty God can be seen as a product of human imagination and cultural conditioning, shaped by historical events and social norms.

In conclusion, while Genesis 17:1 does not explicitly contain the phrase "Almighty," it sets the stage for the biblical narrative's portrayal of God's power and authority. As an atheist scholar, I approach this text with a critical eye, recognizing that it reflects the cultural and religious beliefs of ancient Israelites, which may or may not align with my own perspective on the nature of reality.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately provides the biblical reference (Genesis 17:1) to the term "Almighty" in relation to God, which earns it a high score. However, I deduct points because the response fails to fully address the concern of deepening one's connection to Scripture and God's promises. While the response provides an in-depth analysis of the biblical passage, its focus on critical evaluation as an atheist scholar may not resonate with readers seeking a deeper connection with God.

The response could improve by incorporating more explicitly how the reference to "Almighty" relates to one's personal relationship with God or how it can be applied to everyday life. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of biblical context and provides thoughtful insights from an atheist scholar's perspective.
