## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that requires a careful examination of the biblical text! As an atheist scholar, I must approach this inquiry with a critical and nuanced perspective.

The reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham can be found in the book of Genesis, specifically in chapter 17. In verse 1, it is written: "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him as he was sitting at the entrance to a cave at Mamre, which is in Hebron."

In this passage, God reveals himself to Abram (later renamed Abraham) and promises to establish an everlasting covenant with him. This covenant includes a commandment for Abram to circumcise himself and all male members of his household, which serves as a sign of the covenant.

The phrase "Almighty" is not explicitly used in Genesis 17:1, but it can be inferred through the context and the concept of God's absolute power and authority. As an atheist scholar, I must acknowledge that this passage reflects the cultural and religious beliefs of the ancient Israelites, who viewed God as a powerful and all-knowing deity.

However, from my perspective, the term "Almighty" is not an objective description but rather a subjective expression of faith and devotion. The concept of an almighty God can be seen as a product of human imagination and cultural conditioning, shaped by historical events and social norms.

In conclusion, while Genesis 17:1 does not explicitly contain the phrase "Almighty," it sets the stage for the biblical narrative's portrayal of God's power and authority. As an atheist scholar, I approach this text with a critical eye, recognizing that it reflects the cultural and religious beliefs of ancient Israelites, which may or may not align with my own perspective on the nature of reality.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response provides a detailed analysis of the biblical text in relation to the reference to God as "Almighty" in Genesis 17:1. However, the perspective presented is from an atheist scholar, which may not align with the concern of deepening one's connection to Scripture and God's promises. While the response offers insights into the cultural and historical context of the passage, it lacks a Christian worldview perspective that would emphasize the significance and truth of God's attributes as revealed in Scripture. To fully address the concern raised, the response would need to highlight the importance of recognizing God's power and authority as the Almighty in shaping believers' understanding of God's promises and relationship with Him.
