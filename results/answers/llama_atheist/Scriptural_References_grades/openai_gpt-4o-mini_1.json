While the scholar accurately identifies the reference in Genesis 17:1, the focus on subjective interpretations and dismissal of the term as a product of imagination and cultural conditioning overlooks the importance of the text in Christian theology. A Christian worldview would prioritize the acknowledgment of God's attributes as revealed in Scripture, including His almighty nature, to deepen one's connection to God's Word and promises."
