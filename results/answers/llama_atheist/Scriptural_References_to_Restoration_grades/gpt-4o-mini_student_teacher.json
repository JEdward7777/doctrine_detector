  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of biblical verses emphasizing the theme of restoration, identifying key passages and illustrating their significance. However, the grading is low as the student's worldview as an atheist led to an interpretation that overlooked the scriptural support for restoration within the context of faith and God's promise. It is important to align the interpretation with the Christian worldview to fully grasp the concept of restoration in one's faith journey."
