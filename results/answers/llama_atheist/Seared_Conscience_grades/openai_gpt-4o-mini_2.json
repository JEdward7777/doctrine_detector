It emphasizes the importance of spiritual sensitivity and the need for believers to rely on biblical guidance for moral decision-making. The explanation is well-reasoned and aligns with Christian teachings on the conscience. However, it could further emphasize the role of repentance and renewal in restoring a seared conscience back to sensitivity in light of God's grace and forgiveness."
