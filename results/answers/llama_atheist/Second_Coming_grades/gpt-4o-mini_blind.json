However, the answer falls short by not engaging with the theological or supernatural implications of this crucial teaching of Jesus. A Christian-specific worldview would prioritize the theological significance of Jesus as the Son of Man returning in glory, emphasizing the Second Coming, judgment, salvation, and the fulfillment of eschatological expectations. Integrating these aspects would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
