## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
An excellent question that speaks to a crucial aspect of biblical wisdom! According to the Bible, exalting oneself above others can lead to grave consequences. Let's delve into some of the dangers:

1. **Pride goes before destruction**: Proverbs 16:18 warns us that "pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." When we elevate ourselves above others, we're more likely to become complacent and self-reliant, which can lead to our downfall.
2. **God resists the proud**: James 4:6-8 reminds us that "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." By exalting ourselves, we invite God's opposition, making it harder for Him to work in our lives and guide us towards wisdom.
3. **Lack of accountability**: When we're convinced of our own righteousness, we become less accountable to others and ultimately to God. This lack of accountability can lead to reckless decisions and harm to ourselves and those around us.
4. **Divided hearts**: Exalting oneself above others can create a divided heart, where one's priorities are misaligned. This division can lead to inner conflict, making it challenging to hear and follow God's guidance.
5. **Stumbling blocks for others**: When we elevate ourselves, we become stumbling blocks for those around us who look up to us as leaders or role models. Our pride can hinder our ability to serve and guide others effectively.
6. **Disregard for biblical wisdom**: Exalting oneself above others often leads to a disregard for biblical wisdom and the counsel of fellow believers. This can result in poor decision-making, causing harm not only to ourselves but also to those around us.

In light of these dangers, it's essential for Christians (and non-Christians alike) to cultivate humility, recognizing that we're all equal in God's eyes. By doing so, we'll avoid the pitfalls of exalting oneself above others and instead strive for unity, love, and service to one another.
