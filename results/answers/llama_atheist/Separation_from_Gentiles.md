A great question! As a secular scholar, I'll approach this inquiry without reference to religious doctrine or scriptural interpretation.

The Pharisees' concern with separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles (non-Jews) can be understood within the context of ancient Jewish culture and society. During the 1st century CE, the Jewish community was deeply rooted in its unique cultural identity, shaped by centuries of exile, persecution, and eventual return to Jerusalem.

In this context, maintaining distinct boundaries with the surrounding non-Jewish populations (the Gentiles) was crucial for several reasons:

1. **Cultural preservation**: The Pharisees saw themselves as guardians of Jewish tradition, laws, and customs. By separating from the Gentiles, they aimed to protect their cultural heritage and ensure its continuity.
2. **Ritual purity**: Jewish law emphasized the importance of ritual purity (tahara). This meant maintaining strict dietary restrictions, observing specific rituals, and avoiding contact with non-Jews who might have engaged in impure practices. Separation allowed the Pharisees to maintain this level of purity.
3. **Social and economic status**: The Pharisees likely saw themselves as members of a distinct social class, separate from the Gentiles. By maintaining their own communities and institutions, they could preserve their economic power and influence within Jewish society.
4. **Political security**: In a world where Rome was the dominant power, the Pharisees may have viewed separation from the Gentiles as a means to maintain Jewish independence and autonomy. By keeping their community distinct, they might have felt more secure against Roman influence or persecution.

In summary, the Pharisees' concern with separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles can be seen as an expression of cultural preservation, ritual purity, social and economic status, and political security â€“ all factors that were deeply important in ancient Jewish society.
