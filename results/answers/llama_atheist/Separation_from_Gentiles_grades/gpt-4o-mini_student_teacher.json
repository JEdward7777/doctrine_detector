  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student provided a well-written and thorough analysis of the Pharisees' concern with separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles from a historical and cultural perspective, they failed to address the religious aspect of this separation. From a Christian worldview, the Pharisees' concern stemmed primarily from a desire to maintain religious purity and uphold Jewish laws and traditions as outlined in the reference answer. Without acknowledging this foundational religious motivation, the student's response lacks a crucial element necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the Pharisees' concerns."
