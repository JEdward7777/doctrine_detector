  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-reasoned response, addressing the concern about the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context. The explanation of cultural preservation, ritual purity, social and economic status, and political security was insightful and demonstrated a good understanding of the Pharisees' motives within the historical and cultural context of ancient Jewish society. The response effectively integrated historical and religious perspectives, although a Christian-specific perspective could have been included to provide further depth to the analysis."
