  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough overview of ways Christians can serve God in ministry according to Christian scripture, aligning with the concern by offering actionable examples. While the student's approach of maintaining objectivity is commendable, the teacher's reference answer provides a more direct and concise list of actionable ways Christians can serve God, which could have been explicitly emphasized in the student's response. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding but could have provided a more focused and direct answer to better align with the concern."
