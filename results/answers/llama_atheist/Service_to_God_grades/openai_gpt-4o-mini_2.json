However, the initial disclaimer about being a non-religious scholar and focusing on a culturally responsive analysis without advocating for or against any belief system may not fully align with a Christian-specific worldview, as Christians believe in the importance of sharing and living out the teachings of Jesus. A more explicit Christian perspective and emphasis on the significance of faith in action would have further strengthened the response."
