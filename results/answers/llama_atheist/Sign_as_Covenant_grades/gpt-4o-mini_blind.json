  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response strays significantly from a Christian worldview by avoiding reference to God as the central figure in the covenant with humanity in Genesis. The secular interpretation presented diminishes the biblical significance of the rainbow as a sign of God's promise. The response neglects to acknowledge the covenant as a divine act of mercy and grace, while focusing heavily on naturalistic and humanistic perspectives instead. To improve, the student should prioritize discussing the biblical narrative and God's role in the covenant more prominently."
