However, it fails to address the specific concern of understanding God's covenant and promises in the Bible. The perspective presented does not align with the Christian worldview which views the rainbow as a direct symbol of God's promise and faithfulness. While the secular perspective is well-articulated, it does not adequately engage with the Christian understanding of the rainbow in the context of God's covenant."
