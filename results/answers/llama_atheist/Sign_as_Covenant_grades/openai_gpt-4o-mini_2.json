While it provides a secular perspective on the symbolism of the rainbow, it veers away from the foundational Christian interpretation rooted in God's promise to humanity. It minimizes the significance of God's role in the covenant with Noah and focuses more on naturalistic explanations. A stronger connection to the biblical context and the theological significance of God's promise through the rainbow is needed for a higher grade."
