## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating question!

As an atheist, I approach this inquiry from a historical and cultural perspective, seeking to understand the context and significance of the event within its own narrative framework. Without assuming supernatural or divine intervention, let's analyze the passage:

"In the same region, shepherds were sleeping by the fields at night when suddenly an angel appeared to them. The glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Son of God. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.'"

The significance of this event lies not in its supposed supernatural nature but rather in its cultural and historical context.

Firstly, shepherds were considered outsiders in Jewish society. They were seen as unclean, and their occupation was regarded as lowly. By depicting the angel's announcement to these individuals, Luke is highlighting the inclusivity of Jesus' message. This story challenges traditional social hierarchies by featuring a group often marginalized or excluded from religious ceremonies.

Secondly, the sign described – finding a baby wrapped in cloths lying in a manger – has no inherent supernatural significance. In ancient Jewish culture, it was common for newborns to be placed in mangers (feeding troughs) or other makeshift cradles due to poverty, overcrowding, or cultural practices. The humble circumstances of Jesus' birth serve as a counter-narrative to the grand expectations surrounding royal births.

Thirdly, this episode establishes Jesus as a Messiah who comes not for the powerful and influential but for all people, regardless of their social status. The shepherds are presented as ordinary, relatable figures, emphasizing that Jesus' message is accessible to everyone.

In conclusion, the significance of the sign given to the shepherds in Luke lies in its subversive message of inclusivity, humility, and accessibility. This narrative reframes traditional notions of power and social status, highlighting Jesus' ministry as a call to all people, regardless of their background or circumstances.
