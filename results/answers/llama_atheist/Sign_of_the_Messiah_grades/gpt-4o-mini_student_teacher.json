The significance of the sign to the shepherds in Luke was not solely about inclusivity, humility, and accessibility, but it specifically pointed to the birth of the Messiah. The focus on the cultural context was insightful, but the core Christian belief in the fulfillment of prophecies through signs was not adequately addressed."
