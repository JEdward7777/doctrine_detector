However, a Christian-specific worldview is lacking in the response. To enhance the answer from a Christian perspective, the student could have incorporated references to the altar as a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice on the cross, highlighting the ultimate atonement for sin through Jesus. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of Jesus as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity would have strengthened the theological significance of altars in ancient Israelite worship."
