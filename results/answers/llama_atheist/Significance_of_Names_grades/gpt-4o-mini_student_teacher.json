  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed and thoughtful exploration of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. They demonstrate an understanding of the cultural and linguistic contexts surrounding this translation choice. However, the answer strays into areas not directly relevant to the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith, such as the atheistic perspective and the examination of the Mesopotamian pantheon. To improve the grade, the student should focus more directly on how translating 'Shaddai' as a title or name impacts the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith."
