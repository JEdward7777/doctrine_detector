  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title versus a name, and acknowledges how this choice can impact the perception of God's attributes and relational aspect. The student demonstrates an understanding of the cultural and linguistic context surrounding the term. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of personal relationship with God in the Christian faith and how understanding God's character as both almighty and personal is integral to one's spiritual journey. Additionally, while exploring the Mesopotamian pantheon may provide historical context, the focus should remain on cultivating a deeper understanding of God within a Christian worldview."
