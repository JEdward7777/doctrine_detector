The discussion on the biblical authors' emphasis on God's attributes and actions through titles is well-analyzed. However, the response falls short in directly addressing the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith, which is the specified concern. It would have been beneficial to connect the discussion on titles like \"Shaddai\" to how Christians can understand and relate to God through his attributes as revealed in Scripture, particularly in terms of personal relationship and character traits."
