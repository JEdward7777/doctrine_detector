It delves into the Hebrew roots of the word and explores the cultural context of using divine names or epithets. While the response acknowledges the importance of understanding God's attributes, it falls short in explicitly connecting this understanding to the relational aspect in the Christian faith. A more direct engagement with how translating \"Shaddai\" impacts one's relationship with God, and how it reflects God's character as revealed in Christian theology, would have strengthened the response."
