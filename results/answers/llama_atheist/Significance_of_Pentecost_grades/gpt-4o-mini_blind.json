However, it neglects the crucial theological and supernatural aspects of Pentecost as recorded in the New Testament. A more balanced approach that integrates both the cultural and theological significance would have strengthened the overall argument. Additionally, the answer could have connected the events of Pentecost to broader biblical themes and the overarching plan of God for salvation, providing a more comprehensive understanding of its significance in the New Testament."
