  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed historical and cultural perspective on the significance of the Day of Pentecost, which relates well to the concern about understanding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers. However, the lack of emphasis on the supernatural aspect of the Holy Spirit's empowerment and the fulfillment of Jesus' promise detracts from the core Christian worldview. The student's response could be improved by connecting the historical context to the theological significance of the Holy Spirit's empowerment on Pentecost, as outlined in the reference answer from the teacher."
