It effectively explores how the empowerment by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost enabled the believers to spread the message of Jesus Christ. The only aspect that could enhance the response is directly addressing the concern by explicitly connecting the believers' empowerment by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost to the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers."
