  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the symbolism of unleavened bread from a cultural and historical perspective, but failed to address the specific Christian teaching regarding the removal of sin and living a life that honors God. While the student demonstrated a good understanding of the broader significance of unleavened bread, the lack of integration of the Christian perspective is a significant concern from a Christian worldview."
