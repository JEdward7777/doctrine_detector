As an atheist, the response lacks insight into the core Christian belief that unleavened bread symbolizes the removal of sin and the importance of living in a way that honors God. The focus on cultural and historical perspectives, while informative, does not address the specific concern regarding the spiritual meaning within Christian teachings."
