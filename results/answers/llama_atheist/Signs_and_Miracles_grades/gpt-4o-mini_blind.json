  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60 \n\nComments: The student has provided a thorough analysis of the role of signs and miracles in ancient Mediterranean cultures, including Jewish and early Christian contexts. However, as a Christian worldview prioritizes faith and the supernatural, the student's atheistic perspective leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of the significance of signs and miracles in validating the truth of God's message. The emphasis on empirical inquiry and skepticism detracts from the foundational belief in the power of God to work through signs and miracles to reveal His truth. The student's response lacks acknowledgment of the spiritual and transformative nature of signs and miracles as expressions of divine authority and love."
