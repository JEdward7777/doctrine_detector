  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the role of signs and miracles in ancient Mediterranean cultures, including early Christianity, and offered insightful perspectives on authentication, illustration, witness, and apologetics. However, the student's emphasis on the limitations of signs and miracles as empirical evidence for the existence of God conflicts with a Christian worldview that views these supernatural occurrences as manifestations of God's power and authority. The student's atheistic perspective may hinder a full understanding of the significance of signs and miracles in the context of God's revelation."
