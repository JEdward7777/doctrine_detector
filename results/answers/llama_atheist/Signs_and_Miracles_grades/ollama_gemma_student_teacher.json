  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the role of signs and miracles in early Christianity. They provide a well-researched and articulate analysis of the cultural and historical context of these events, highlighting their significance as authentication, illustration, witness, and apologetics. \n\nWhile the student acknowledges the limitations of signs and miracles as scientific proof or empirical evidence, they effectively argue that these supernatural events served as validations of God\u2019s power and authority. \n\nThe inclusion of an atheistic perspective adds depth to the analysis, demonstrating the student's ability to consider different viewpoints and challenge assumptions. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points of the answer and avoids simplistic or uncritical acceptance of religious claims."
