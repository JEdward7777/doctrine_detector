  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides some insightful analysis of the role of signs and miracles in ancient Mediterranean cultures, including their use as authentication, illustration, witness, and apologetics. However, it falls short of fully engaging with the concern about the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation.\n\nThe response ultimately reduces the significance of signs and miracles to a cultural phenomenon, viewing them as a means to validate Jesus' authority within their historical context. While this is an important observation, it does not adequately explore how faith and trust in God might intersect with these supernatural events.\n\nIn particular, the response does not grapple with the idea that signs and miracles might be more than just a cultural phenomenon, but rather a manifestation of God's power and authority. The answer also does not provide much theological reflection on how faith is related to these events or how they might shape one's understanding of God's revelation.\n\nTo earn a higher grade, the response could have delved deeper into the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation, exploring how these events might inform and shape one's trust in God."
