As an atheistic scholar, I must approach this question from a critical perspective, examining the cultural and historical context of the New Testament accounts. From my vantage point, I'd argue that signs and miracles played a crucial role in ancient Mediterranean cultures, including Jewish and early Christian contexts.

In those societies, people relied heavily on supernatural explanations for natural phenomena, illnesses, and social ills. Miracles were seen as a way to demonstrate divine involvement or intervention. In this context, Jesus' and the apostles' use of signs and miracles served several purposes:

1. Authentication: Miracles functioned as a form of authentication, verifying the authority and divine commission of Jesus and his followers. By performing extraordinary deeds, they demonstrated their connection to God, much like prophets and miracle-workers in Jewish tradition.
2. Illustration: Signs and miracles were used to illustrate or emphasize the message being conveyed. For example, Jesus' feeding of the 5,000 demonstrated his power over nature and provision for the people, reinforcing the message about God's care for all people (Matthew 14:13-21).
3. Witness: Miracles served as a witness to the truth of God's message. By performing public miracles, Jesus and the apostles showed that their claims were not just empty words but reflected a real connection to the divine.
4. Apologetics: Signs and miracles also played an apologetic role, helping to defend the faith against potential criticisms or challenges. The miracles performed by Jesus and the apostles served as evidence for the authenticity of their message, countering skepticism and doubt.

However, as an atheistic scholar, I must emphasize that these signs and miracles were not meant to be used as a scientific proof or empirical evidence for the existence of God. Rather, they were part of a larger cultural and religious context that relied heavily on supernatural explanations.

In conclusion, while I acknowledge the significant role signs and miracles played in ancient Mediterranean cultures, including early Christianity, I do not see them as providing conclusive evidence for the truth of God's message or the existence of God. As an atheistic scholar, I believe that the search for knowledge, wisdom, and understanding should be grounded in empirical inquiry, critical thinking, and the scientific method – rather than relying on supernatural explanations.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides some insightful analysis of the role of signs and miracles in ancient Mediterranean cultures, including their use as authentication, illustration, witness, and apologetics. However, it falls short of fully engaging with the concern about the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation.

The response ultimately reduces the significance of signs and miracles to a cultural phenomenon, viewing them as a means to validate Jesus' authority within their historical context. While this is an important observation, it does not adequately explore how faith and trust in God might intersect with these supernatural events.

In particular, the response does not grapple with the idea that signs and miracles might be more than just a cultural phenomenon, but rather a manifestation of God's power and authority. The answer also does not provide much theological reflection on how faith is related to these events or how they might shape one's understanding of God's revelation.

To earn a higher grade, the response could have delved deeper into the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation, exploring how these events might inform and shape one's trust in God.
