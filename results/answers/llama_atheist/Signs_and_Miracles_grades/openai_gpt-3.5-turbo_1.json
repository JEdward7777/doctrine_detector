However, their worldview lacks acknowledgment of the central role of faith in understanding and interpreting signs and miracles as revelations of God's power and authority. While the response offers valuable insights, it falls short in addressing the deeper relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation from a Christian worldview perspective."
