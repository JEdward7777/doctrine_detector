However, the atheistic scholar's view of these events as purely cultural and lacking in empirical evidence goes against the Christian worldview that sees signs and miracles as divine interventions and manifestations of God's presence. The response falls short in fully addressing the concern of examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation from a Christian perspective."
