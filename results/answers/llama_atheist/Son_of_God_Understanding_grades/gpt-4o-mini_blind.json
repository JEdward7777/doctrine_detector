  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed analysis of the term \"Son of God\" from historical, linguistic, and theological perspectives. While the answer demonstrates a scholarly approach and explores various interpretations, it falls short in explicitly affirming the core Christian doctrine of Jesus as the unique Son of God who shares in the divine nature of God the Father. The response could benefit from a clearer affirmation of Jesus' deity and the Trinitarian relationship between Jesus and God the Father, in line with orthodox Christian teachings. Additionally, the student could improve by framing their analysis within a Christian worldview rather than maintaining a neutral academic stance."
