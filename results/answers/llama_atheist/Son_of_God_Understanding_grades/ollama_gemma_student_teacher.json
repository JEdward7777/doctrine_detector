They provide a nuanced analysis of its historical and linguistic origins, considering various interpretations and cultural influences. The inclusion of scholarly references and thoughtful considerations of different perspectives adds depth to the discussion. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit affirmation of Jesus' divinity as the ultimate interpretation of the term."
