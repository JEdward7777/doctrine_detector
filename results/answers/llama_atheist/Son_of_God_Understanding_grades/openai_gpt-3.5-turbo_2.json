While it acknowledges different interpretations and nuances of the term, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of understanding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God. The response could have been strengthened by clearly emphasizing the Christian belief that Jesus is fully God and shares the same nature as God the Father, especially in contrast to other uses of the term in ancient literature."
