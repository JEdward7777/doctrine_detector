The explanation is concise and well-structured, addressing the concern of avoiding confusion in theological discussions. The answer aligns with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the unique significance of Jesus as the Son of God while also acknowledging the broader concept of believers being \"sons of God.\" Great job in presenting the information clearly and accurately within a Christian specific worldview."
