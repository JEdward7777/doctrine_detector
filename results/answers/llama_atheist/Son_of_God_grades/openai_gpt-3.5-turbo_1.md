# Answer by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating question! As an atheist scholar, I'll approach this inquiry without the burden of theological presuppositions.

The phrase "Son of God" (Latin: Filius Dei) is a title specifically attributed to Jesus Christ in the New Testament. In a Jewish context, it's a messianic claim that echoes the Old Testament concept of Yahweh as the divine King and Judge (Psalm 2:7). This title emphasizes Jesus' divinity, authority, and connection to God.

On the other hand, "sons of God" (Hebrew: bnei ha-elohim) is a phrase used in Jewish Scripture to describe believers, specifically those who have a special relationship with God. In this context, being a "son of God" means being part of God's family or having a divine origin.

Several key differences distinguish the two uses:

1. Context: The "Son of God" title is exclusively associated with Jesus Christ in Christian scripture, while "sons of God" is used to describe believers in Jewish Scripture.
2. Meaning: The "Son of God" title connotes divinity and messianic authority, whereas "sons of God" emphasizes a spiritual connection or family relationship with God.
3. Scope: The "Son of God" title is unique to Jesus, while "sons of God" can be applied to any believer who has a special relationship with God.

In summary, the title "Son of God" refers specifically to Jesus Christ in Christian scripture, highlighting his divinity and messianic authority. In contrast, "sons of God" describes believers in Jewish Scripture, emphasizing their spiritual connection or family relationship with God.
