  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and thorough explanation of the distinction between \"Son of God\" and \"sons of God\" within a Christian context, addressing the concern of avoiding confusion in theological discussions. The student effectively outlines the key differences in context, meaning, and scope between the two terms. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to acknowledge and address the Christian worldview perspective on the nature of Jesus as the unique Son of God in relation to believers as sons of God. This additional insight would have strengthened the response from a Christian-specific worldview."
