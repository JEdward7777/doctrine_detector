  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and concise explanation of the distinction between \"Son of God\" and \"sons of God,\" addressing the concern raised about avoiding confusion in theological discussions. The analysis from an atheist scholar's perspective is respectful and informative. The Christian worldview would appreciate the acknowledgment of Jesus as God's only Son and the broader understanding of believers as \"sons of God.\""
