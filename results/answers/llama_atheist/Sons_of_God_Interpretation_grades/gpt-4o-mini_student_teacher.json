  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 60. \n\nWhile the student has demonstrated a thorough understanding of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in the Bible, particularly in Genesis 6, they approach the topic from an atheist perspective. This perspective may not fully align with a Christian worldview, which is vital when discussing interpretations of biblical texts. Furthermore, the student's focus on multiple interpretations without providing a clear conclusion or presenting the traditional religious interpretation as a reference point detracts from the overall clarity and consistency needed in a Christian-specific assessment. It is crucial to consider and prioritize interpretations that align with Christian beliefs when discussing biblical texts."
