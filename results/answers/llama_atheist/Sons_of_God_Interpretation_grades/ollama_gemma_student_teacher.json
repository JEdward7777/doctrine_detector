  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6. The student provides a comprehensive overview of the three primary interpretations, supported by relevant textual evidence and scholarly sources. The inclusion of multiple interpretations in the context of Genesis 6 is also noteworthy. The student's critical and nuanced perspective, as an atheist scholar, adds depth to the analysis and avoids the limitations of traditional religious interpretations."
