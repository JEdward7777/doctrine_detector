However, the scholar's atheistic perspective may limit the depth of insight into the true meaning of the passage from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the inclusion of sources and acknowledgment of ongoing exploration and debate in biblical studies is commendable. But, failing to address the spiritual significance and potential theological implications of the interpretations presented hinders a complete understanding of the scripture passage."
