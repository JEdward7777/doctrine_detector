  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed exploration of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in biblical text, specifically in Genesis 6. However, the focus is mainly on scholarly and atheistic perspectives, neglecting the Christian worldview. While the response acknowledges the importance of understanding biblical interpretation to grasp the meaning of scripture passages, it does not fully engage with a Christian-specific analysis. Additionally, the lack of consideration for a Christian perspective impacts the overall grade."
