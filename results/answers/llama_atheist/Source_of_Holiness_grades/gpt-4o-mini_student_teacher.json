However, the answer fails to address the central role of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of holiness, which is a crucial aspect of Christian doctrine according to the reference answer. It is important to emphasize the foundational belief that believers become saints through their faith in Jesus Christ, rather than through their own deeds or the formal process of canonization."
