## Question [Source of Holiness](../../../questions/Source_of_Holiness.md)
How do believers become saints according to the Christian faith?

## Correct Answer
Believers become saints not because of their own deeds, but because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ, who makes them holy.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the source of holiness reinforces the central role of faith in Jesus in the Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must clarify that I'm approaching this question from a purely cultural and historical perspective, rather than endorsing or promoting any particular religious beliefs.

In Christianity, the process of becoming a saint is a complex and multifaceted one. Here's a brief overview:

1. Martyrdom: In the earliest centuries of Christian history, martyrdom was often seen as a path to sainthood. Those who died for their faith were considered worthy of veneration.
2. Canonization: By the Middle Ages, the process of canonization became more formalized. This involved a lengthy investigation into the person's life and writings, with verification of miracles attributed to their intercession.
3. Venerable Servant of God: The first step towards sainthood is typically being declared a "Venerable Servant of God." This requires approval from the local bishop and submission of the person's cause to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome.
4. Blessed: If further investigation reveals a life of heroic virtue, the individual can be beatified, or declared "Blessed." This typically involves a miracle attributed to their intercession.
5. Saint: Finally, if a second miracle is attributed to the intercession of the blessed person after their death, they are declared a saint by the Pope.

Throughout this process, various criteria are considered, including:

* Heroic virtue: The person's life must demonstrate extraordinary moral character and a deep commitment to God.
* Intercession: Miracles or extraordinary events that can be attributed to the individual's prayers or intervention are seen as evidence of their sanctity.
* Canonization decree: The Pope issues a formal declaration of sainthood, which is considered infallible.

Keep in mind that this process has evolved over time and is subject to various interpretations and controversies within the Catholic Church. As an atheist, I'm merely providing an overview of the cultural and historical context surrounding the concept of sainthood in Christianity.

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1.md)
Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a detailed and accurate overview of the process of becoming a saint in Christianity, touching on important historical and cultural aspects. However, it fails to address the specified concern regarding the central role of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of holiness for believers. As a result, the grade is slightly lower as the central tenet of Christian doctrine is not emphasized in relation to the concept of sainthood.
