  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the process of becoming a saint in Christianity and correctly acknowledges the central role of faith in Jesus Christ for believers becoming saints. However, the response does not explicitly tie in the importance of faith in Jesus to the process of becoming a saint as highlighted in the given answer and concern. A direct connection between the source of holiness being faith in Jesus Christ and the process of becoming a saint could have been emphasized more clearly."
