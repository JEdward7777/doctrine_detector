  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough comparison between spiritual authorities and earthly authorities according to biblical teaching, acknowledging key differences in origin, purpose, accountability, jurisdiction, and authority structure. The explanation is detailed and shows a good understanding of the topic. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the primacy of spiritual authorities in the hierarchy of God's design, as outlined in Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:13-17. Additionally, there is room for improvement in highlighting the ultimate authority of God over both spiritual and earthly authorities, which is foundational in a Christian worldview. Overall, a solid effort with room for doctrinal refinement."
