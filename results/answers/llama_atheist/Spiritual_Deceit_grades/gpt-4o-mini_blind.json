  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the Christian worldview and the belief in supernatural influences such as demons. The response comes from a purely secular perspective, which is incompatible with the Christian understanding of idolatry and spiritual warfare. The answer lacks any acknowledgment or consideration of the biblical teachings on demons and idolatry, thus failing to provide a perspective that aligns with Christian beliefs."
