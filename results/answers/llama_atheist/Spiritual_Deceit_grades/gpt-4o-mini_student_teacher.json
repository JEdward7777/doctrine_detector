  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student's response fails to address the concerns of the Christian worldview and the importance of spiritual deceit emphasized in the key concern. From a Christian perspective, demons are believed to actively deceive individuals into idolatry, leading them away from the truth of God's sovereignty. The student's secular analysis, while thoughtful and well-articulated, does not align with the Christian perspective on demons and idolatry. Additionally, the student dismisses the supernatural aspect of demons, which is a key belief in Christianity. As a result, the grade is lower due to the lack of alignment with the Christian worldview."
