From a Christian perspective, demons are real spiritual beings who can deceive individuals into idolatry and lead them away from the truth of God's sovereignty. The response fails to acknowledge the potential spiritual warfare aspect emphasized in the concern, thereby missing the mark on addressing the Christian worldview on this topic."
