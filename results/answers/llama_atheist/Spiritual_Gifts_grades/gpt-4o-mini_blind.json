  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the implications of spiritual gifts as described in the Bible, covering various aspects such as early Christian communities, mission and evangelism, church leadership, social justice, and inclusivity. The explanation of the biblical perspective on spiritual gifts and their role in empowering believers was well-articulated. However, the student's perspective shifts towards an atheistic viewpoint towards the end, which diverges from a Christian worldview. It is important to maintain doctrinal correctness throughout the response when discussing biblical concepts."
