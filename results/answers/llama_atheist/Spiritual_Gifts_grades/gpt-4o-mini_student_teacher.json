  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive understanding of the concept of spiritual gifts as described in the Bible and highlighted some significant implications in historical and cultural contexts. However, the response veered off-course by introducing a perspective from an atheistic scholar, which detracts from the focus on utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. The student should have maintained a consistent Christian worldview throughout the analysis."
