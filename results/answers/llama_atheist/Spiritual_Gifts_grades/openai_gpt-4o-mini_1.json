It effectively addresses the concern of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and obedience to the Holy Spirit. However, the inclusion of the atheistic scholar's perspective may undermine the importance of spiritual gifts from a Christian worldview. The response could be strengthened by focusing more on the theological implications and practical applications of spiritual gifts within a Christian context."
