  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a thoughtful analysis from a non-religious perspective, they missed the mark in addressing the importance of community in spiritual growth, as specified in the concern. The student's answer focused more on personal growth and social bonding from a secular standpoint rather than exploring the unique dynamics of confessing sins within a Christian community. The reference answer emphasizes the role of accountability, support, and encouragement among believers, which the student failed to incorporate effectively. A stronger connection to the Christian-specific worldview and the significance of communal confession for spiritual healing would have improved the grade."
