They highlighted key aspects such as forgiveness, justification, transformation, and eternal life. However, the answer could have more directly addressed the concern by explicitly linking the concept of salvation to its impact on one's faith and assurance of eternal life. Additionally, the use of terms like \"atheistic scholar\" and \"culturally retributed\" may detract from a purely Christian worldview perspective."
