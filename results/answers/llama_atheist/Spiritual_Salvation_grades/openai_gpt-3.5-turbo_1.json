It also acknowledges the impact of this understanding on individuals and society. However, as an atheistic scholar, the response lacks a personal connection to the Christian worldview and falls short of fully engaging with the concern regarding how understanding salvation can impact one's faith and assurance of eternal life. The response could have demonstrated a deeper reflection on the implications of salvation from a Christian perspective, despite the writer's atheistic position."
