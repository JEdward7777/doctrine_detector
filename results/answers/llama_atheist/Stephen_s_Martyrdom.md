Significance:

1. **Prototypical martyr**: Stephen's stoning serves as a prototype for later Christian martyrs. His death demonstrates that early Christians were willing to face persecution and even death for their faith.

2. **Social and cultural tensions**: Christianity's message was seen as subversive by the Roman Empire, leading to social and cultural tensions within the early Christian community.
3. **Internal conflicts**: The stoning of Stephen also reveals internal conflicts within the early Christian community, such as debates over Jewish law and tradition vs. the emerging teachings of Jesus Christ.
4. **Missionary outreach**: Despite these challenges, early Christians continued to spread their message, establishing new communities and laying the groundwork for the rapid expansion of Christianity throughout the Mediterranean region.

In conclusion, the stoning of Stephen is a pivotal event in the early Christian church, revealing the growing tensions between Christianity and Jewish authorities, as well as the challenges faced by early believers.
