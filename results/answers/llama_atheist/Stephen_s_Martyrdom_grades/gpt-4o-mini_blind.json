The answer lacks any theological insights, scriptural references, or acknowledgment of Stephen's faith in Christ, which are crucial elements in understanding the event's true significance within the early Christian church. Encouraging the student to incorporate Christian doctrinal perspectives and references to Scripture would greatly enhance the depth and accuracy of the response."
