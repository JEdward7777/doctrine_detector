3. **Internal conflicts**: The stoning of Stephen also reveals internal conflicts within the early Christian community, such as debates over Jewish law and tradition vs. the emerging teachings of Jesus Christ.
4. **Missionary outreach**: Despite these challenges, early Christians continued to spread their message, establishing new communities and laying the groundwork for the rapid expansion of Christianity throughout the Mediterranean region.
