It effectively addresses the concern of reflecting on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. However, from a Christian perspective, there could be more emphasis on the divine sovereignty at play in Stephen's martyrdom and how it aligns with Jesus' teachings on persecution and faithfulness. Additionally, incorporating scriptural references or theological insights would strengthen the response."
