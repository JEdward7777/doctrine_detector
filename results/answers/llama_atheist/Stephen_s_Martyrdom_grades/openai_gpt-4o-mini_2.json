The challenges faced by early believers are well addressed, with a clear focus on persecution and internal conflicts. The reflection on the cost of discipleship and faithfulness in the face of persecution is well articulated. The response effectively demonstrates an understanding of the importance of Stephen's martyrdom in shaping the early Christian community."
