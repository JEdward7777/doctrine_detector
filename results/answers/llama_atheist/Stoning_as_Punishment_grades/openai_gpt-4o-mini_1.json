However, the lack of emphasis on the divine nature of God's justice and mercy, as well as the failure to fully apply a Christian worldview in evaluating the practice of stoning, leads to a limited understanding of these concepts. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration of how God's justice and mercy are intertwined in His commandments and how they are ultimately fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ."
