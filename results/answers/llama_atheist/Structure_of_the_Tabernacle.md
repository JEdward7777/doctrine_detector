## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist scholar, I'll approach this question without any religious or mystical connotations. Let's examine the Tabernacle from a purely historical and cultural perspective.

The Tabernacle is believed to have been built during the Israelites' wilderness period, as described in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). It was a portable sanctuary that served as a center of worship and community gathering for the Israelites.

According to the biblical account, the Tabernacle consisted of two main sections:

1. The Holy Place (Hebrew: הֵיכָל קֹדֶשׁ, Heiḵāl Qōdeš): This section was approximately 15 feet long and 6.75 feet wide. It contained the following items:
	* A golden altar of incense (Exodus 30:1-10)
	* A table for the bread of the Presence (Leviticus 24:5-9)
	* A lampstand (menorah) with seven branches
2. The Holy of Holies (Hebrew: הֵיכָל קֹדֶשׁ קְדוֹשִׁים, Heiḵāl Qōdeš Qədōšîm): This section was approximately 15 feet long and 6.75 feet wide. It contained:
	* The Ark of the Covenant (Exodus 25:10-22)
	* The Mercy Seat or Covering (Hebrew: כִּסֵא מְרַצִּים, Kisei Məratţiym)

These two sections were separated by a curtain or veil, which only the High Priest could enter. The Holy of Holies was considered the most sacred area, where God's presence was believed to reside.

From an anthropological and cultural perspective, the Tabernacle can be seen as a physical representation of the Israelites' spiritual and communal life. The two sections may have symbolized different aspects of their relationship with their god(s): the Holy Place representing the ordinary, daily interactions, while the Holy of Holies represented the extraordinary, sacred encounters.

Keep in mind that this analysis is based on historical and cultural research, rather than any theological or religious interpretations.
