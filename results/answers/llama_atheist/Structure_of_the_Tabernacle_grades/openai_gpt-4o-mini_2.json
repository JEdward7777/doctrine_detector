However, it does not address the significance of these components in worship, which was the specified concern. From a Christian worldview, understanding the significance of the items within the Tabernacle is crucial as they pointed to Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice and mediator between God and humanity. The response would have been stronger if it had connected the components to their spiritual and worship significance in the Christian faith."
