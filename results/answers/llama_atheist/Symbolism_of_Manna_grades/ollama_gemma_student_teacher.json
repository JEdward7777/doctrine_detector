  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical account of manna and its significance regarding God's provision. The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the cultural context and symbolism associated with manna, while also acknowledging the broader narrative of God's relationship with his people. The inclusion of an atheistic perspective adds an additional layer of depth to the discussion."
