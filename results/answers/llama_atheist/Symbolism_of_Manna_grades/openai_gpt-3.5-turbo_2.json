The explanation draws on cultural and historical context to deepen the understanding of manna's symbolism. However, the response falls short in addressing the concern of recognizing God's ongoing provision in the lives of believers. It focuses more on the historical and cultural significance of manna rather than emphasizing the continuous nature of God's provision. An integration of how the concept of manna can serve as a reminder of God's ongoing care and provision for believers today would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
