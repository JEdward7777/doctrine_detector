It effectively highlighted how manna represents God's ongoing provision and sustenance for believers. However, there was a lack of acknowledgment of the importance of recognizing this provision in the lives of believers today. A stronger emphasis on the application of the concept of manna to believers' lives in the present would have strengthened the response further from a Christian worldview perspective."
