  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The answer provided by the student attempts to analyze the metaphor of the cornerstone from a secular perspective, which is not aligned with a Christian worldview. The student's interpretation lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to acknowledge the foundational Christian belief that Jesus is the cornerstone of the faith as depicted in passages like Ephesians 2:20 and 1 Peter 2:6. Additionally, the student dismisses the importance of theological bias when discussing a Christian metaphor, which is a significant oversight in this context. The response also neglects the unique relationship between Jesus and His followers within Christian theology, focusing instead on a more generalized interpretation that does not accurately reflect the specific teachings of Jesus as understood by Christians."
