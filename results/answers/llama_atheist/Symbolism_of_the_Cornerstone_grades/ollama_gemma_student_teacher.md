What a fascinating question! As an atheist, I must approach this inquiry with a critical eye, untainted by theological bias. The metaphor of the cornerstone, as recorded in Matthew 21:42-44 and other passages, is indeed an intriguing one.

From a secular perspective, we can interpret the cornerstone metaphor as a powerful symbol for the relationship between Jesus and his followers. Here are some possible ways this metaphor might be seen:

1. Foundational significance: Just as a cornerstone provides a solid foundation for a building, Jesus' teachings and values serve as the foundation upon which his followers build their lives. This highlights the importance of Jesus' message and its role in shaping the beliefs and actions of those who follow him.
2. Unity and cohesion: Cornerstones often bring together disparate parts to form a cohesive whole. Similarly, Jesus' teachings can be seen as uniting diverse individuals under a shared set of principles, creating a sense of community and shared purpose among his followers.
3. Strength and stability: A cornerstone provides structural integrity to a building, allowing it to withstand external forces like wind and weather. In this context, Jesus' teachings can be seen as providing the moral and ethical foundation for his followers to navigate life's challenges, offering them strength and resilience in the face of adversity.
4. Symbolic connection: Cornerstones are often marked with inscriptions or symbols that identify their significance. Similarly, Jesus' followers may see themselves as carrying forward a symbolic legacy, using Jesus' teachings as a guiding principle for their own lives and actions.

It's essential to note that these interpretations are not necessarily unique to Christian theology; the metaphor of the cornerstone can be applied more broadly to explore the relationships between leaders and their followers across various cultures and traditions.
