  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the cornerstone metaphor in relation to Jesus' teachings and its significance for his followers. The author provides several secular interpretations of the metaphor, highlighting its potential applications beyond Christian theology.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly address the concern about aligning one's life with Christ's teachings and example. While the author touches on the idea that Jesus' teachings provide a foundation for building one's life, they do not specifically explore how this relates to believers' daily lives or how it can guide their decisions.\n\nTo strengthen the response, the author could have more explicitly connected the cornerstone metaphor to the concern about aligning one's life with Christ's teachings and example. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical context of the metaphor, exploring its relevance to Christian theology and practice. Nevertheless, the response shows a good understanding of the metaphor and its potential applications, earning an overall grade of 85."
