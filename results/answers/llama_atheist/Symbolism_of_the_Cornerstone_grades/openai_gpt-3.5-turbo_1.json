The explanation provided does not emphasize the importance of believers aligning their lives with Christ's teachings and example based on the given answer. Additionally, there is a lack of emphasis on the Christian worldview in the response, missing an opportunity to highlight the unique significance of Jesus as the cornerstone in Christian faith."
