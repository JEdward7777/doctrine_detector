However, it falls short in directly connecting the interpretations to the stated concern of aligning believers' lives with Christ's teachings and example. While the discussion enriches understanding of the metaphor, the explicit application to guiding believers in aligning their lives with Christ's teachings could have been more prominent for a stronger Christian-specific worldview evaluation."
