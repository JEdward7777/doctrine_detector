However, it falls short in addressing the theological implications and significance of the sacrificial system, particularly in the context of atonement as understood in the Christian worldview. The absence of theological insights limits the depth of understanding on the topic. Additionally, from a Christian perspective, the sacrificial system with its use of animals pointed forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, which is a critical aspect that should have been included in the response."
