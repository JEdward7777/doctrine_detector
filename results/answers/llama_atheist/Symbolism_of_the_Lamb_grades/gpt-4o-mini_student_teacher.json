  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and informative historical and cultural analysis of the significance of using lambs in sacrifices in ancient Near Eastern cultures and their relation to atonement. However, the answer lacked a Christian-specific worldview and did not engage with the concept of Christ as the ultimate sacrificial lamb in Christian theology. The explanation focused more on general historical and cultural aspects rather than on the core Christian understanding of the lamb as representing Christ's sacrifice for the redemption of humanity."
