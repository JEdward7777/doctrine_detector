  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive analysis of the symbolism and significance of lambs in ancient Near Eastern cultures and biblical sacrifices, demonstrating a strong understanding of the cultural context. The explanation aligns with a Christian worldview, particularly in recognizing the themes of innocence, purity, and atonement through sacrificial substitution. However, the response does not explicitly connect the symbolism of the lamb to the understanding of atonement and redemption through Christ, which would have enhanced the Christian perspective."
