However, it falls short of addressing the concern from a Christian worldview. The response does not connect the symbolism of the lamb in ancient sacrifices to the Christian understanding of atonement and redemption through Christ. To fully address the concern, the response should have emphasized how the concept of innocence and purity in the sacrificial lamb ultimately points to Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrificial lamb whose death atones for the sins of humanity."
