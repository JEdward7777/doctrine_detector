However, it falls short in addressing the concern of understanding the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship as indicated by the term 'synagogue'. The provided answer only mentions the term figuratively referring to a group of people meeting for worship, but the response does not delve deeper into this concept or its implications. Instead, it focuses on more general themes and avoids engaging with the specific concern posed."
