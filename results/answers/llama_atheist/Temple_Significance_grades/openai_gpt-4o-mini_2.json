The response focused more on secular interpretations and skepticism towards biblical accounts, rather than exploring the spiritual significance of the Temple as a place of worship and sacrifice to God. An improvement would be to include more insights from a Christian worldview regarding the Temple's central role in the religious practices and beliefs of the Israelites as outlined in the Old Testament."
