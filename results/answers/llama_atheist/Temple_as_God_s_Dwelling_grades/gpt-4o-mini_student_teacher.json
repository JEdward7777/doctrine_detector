However, their approach as an atheist lacks the theological depth necessary to fully comprehend the theological implications of God dwelling among His people. The focus on the cultural context of ancient Near Eastern societies is informative but misses the Christian-specific worldview and understanding of the temple as God's dwelling. The student's acknowledgement of not subscribing to the theological underpinnings further detracts from the depth required for a complete understanding of the question."
