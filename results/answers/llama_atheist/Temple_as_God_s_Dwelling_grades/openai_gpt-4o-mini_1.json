  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive exploration of the concept of temples in both the Old and New Testaments, drawing on historical and cultural contexts. However, it falls short of fully engaging with the theological implications of God dwelling among His people as specifically outlined in the given answer and concern. While the response acknowledges the theological significance of the temple as God's dwelling place, it predominantly focuses on historical and cultural interpretations rather than delving deeply into the theological underpinnings of God's presence among His people. Integrating a more robust theological analysis would strengthen the overall argument and align more closely with the specified concern."
