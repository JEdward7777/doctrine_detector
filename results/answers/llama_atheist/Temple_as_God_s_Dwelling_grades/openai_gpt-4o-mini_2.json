However, it falls short of addressing the core theological implications of God dwelling among His people as stated in the provided answer. The response lacks engagement with the specific Christian worldview perspective that emphasizes believers as temples of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, which is essential for a comprehensive evaluation from a Christian lens."
