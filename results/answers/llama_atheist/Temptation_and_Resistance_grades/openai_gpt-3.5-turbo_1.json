From a Christian worldview, understanding Jesus' victory over temptation is not just about showcasing his moral character but also serves as a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. The response should have emphasized the importance of Jesus' obedience and reliance on the Scriptures as a guide for believers facing similar challenges."
