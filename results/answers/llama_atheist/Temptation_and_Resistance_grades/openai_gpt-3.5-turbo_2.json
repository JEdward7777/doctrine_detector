  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed analysis of Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, highlighting the cultural context, the specific temptations, and Jesus' responses. The mention of Jesus' obedience and commitment to God aligns well with the provided answer. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the concern about providing a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. It would be beneficial to explicitly emphasize how Jesus' resistance to temptation serves as a model and inspiration for believers in their personal spiritual struggles."
