The response focuses more on the academic and historical context of the story rather than emphasizing the spiritual significance of Jesus' resistance to temptation as a model for Christians. Encouraging insights about Jesus' obedience and commitment to God are missing or downplayed in the secular analysis. In a Christian worldview, understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation serves as a crucial example and encouragement for believers to stand firm in their faith against evil."
