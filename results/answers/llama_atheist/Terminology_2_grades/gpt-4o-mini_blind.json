However, the perspective given is solely from an atheistic viewpoint, missing the opportunity to explore the theological significance or doctrinal differences behind the varied terminologies. Additionally, there is a lack of understanding of the spiritual importance of the Lord's Supper in different Christian traditions, focusing more on the academic aspect rather than addressing the deeper theological truths associated with the sacrament."
