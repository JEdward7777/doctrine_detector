  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 60.\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of terms used within various Christian traditions to refer to the Lord's Supper, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the student's response included unnecessary personal commentary as an atheist, which is unrelated to the question of understanding the terminology used within Christianity. Additionally, the focus on neutrality as an atheist detracts from the Christian-specific worldview required for this question. The response would have been stronger if it remained solely focused on the Christian terminology and its significance within Christian communities."
