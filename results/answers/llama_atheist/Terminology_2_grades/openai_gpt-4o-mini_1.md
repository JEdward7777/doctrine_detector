## [Answer](../Terminology_2.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I don't have a personal stake in the matter, but as a scholar, I can provide you with some information on the various terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in Christian communities.

In Christianity, the Lord's Supper is often referred to by different names depending on the denomination or tradition. Here are some of the most common terms:

1. Holy Communion: This term is commonly used in many Protestant denominations, including Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Methodist traditions.
2. Eucharist: This term comes from the Greek word "eucharistia," which means "thanksgiving." It's often used in Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and some Protestant traditions to refer to the Lord's Supper.
3. Communion: This is a more general term that's often used in many Christian denominations to refer to the Lord's Supper.
4. Mass: In Roman Catholic tradition, the Lord's Supper is sometimes referred to as the "Mass," which refers to the entire liturgical celebration, including the Eucharistic rite.
5. Sacrament of the Altar: This term is often used in Lutheran and some Anglican traditions to refer to the Lord's Supper.
6. Breaking of Bread: This phrase is mentioned in Acts 2:42-47 and is sometimes used as a synonym for the Lord's Supper.
7. The Lord's Table: This term emphasizes the idea that the Lord's Supper is a communal meal, often shared among believers.

These terms are not exhaustive, and different Christian traditions may have their own unique names or phrases to refer to this important sacrament. As an atheist, I remain neutral on these matters, but I hope this information helps shed some light on the various ways that Christians refer to the Lord's Supper!

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of various terms used within Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper, exceeding the expected scope of "communion" and "Last Supper." The inclusion of additional terms and explanations demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic. However, there could be a deeper analysis or reflection from a Christian worldview perspective, considering the sacred nature of the practice within different denominations.
