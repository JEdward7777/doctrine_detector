  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided thoughtful alternative terms to describe a deacon in a non-religious context, demonstrating an understanding of the need for sensitivity and nuance when discussing religious terminology. However, the student's response did not directly align with the teacher's reference answer which specified more straightforward alternatives. The student could have improved by including terms more closely related to the traditional role of a deacon within the church setting."
