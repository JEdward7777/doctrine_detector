The suggestions offered, such as \"Ecclesiast,\" \"Cleric,\" \"Minister,\" \"Service provider,\" and \"Community leader,\" demonstrate a deep understanding of the importance of cultural sensitivity and nuance. The response effectively addresses the concern by expanding the scope beyond direct equivalents of the word \"deacon.\""
