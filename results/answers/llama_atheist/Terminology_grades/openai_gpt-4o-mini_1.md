## [Answer](../Terminology.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist scholar, I believe it's essential to approach religious terminology in a nuanced and culturally sensitive manner. When referring to a deacon in a non-religious context, here are some alternative terms you could use:

1. Ecclesiast: This term is derived from the Greek word "kuriakos," meaning "belonging to the Lord." It has been used in various Christian traditions to describe ministers or officials who serve in a church.
2. Cleric: A cleric is a member of the clergy, which is a group of people who are trained to perform religious rituals and ceremonies. In a non-religious context, you could use this term to describe someone who performs similar roles, such as a community organizer or a social worker.
3. Minister: While this term is often associated with Christian ministers, it can be used more broadly to describe anyone who serves in a pastoral capacity, including secular professionals who provide emotional support and guidance to others.
4. Service provider: This term emphasizes the deacon's role in providing aid and assistance to those in need. It could be used to describe someone who works in a social services organization or a non-profit agency.
5. Community leader: A deacon often plays a leadership role within their community, so this term highlights their ability to bring people together and inspire positive change.

Remember that these terms are not direct equivalents of the word "deacon," but they can be used as alternatives in certain contexts. It's essential to consider the cultural and religious background of your audience when selecting a term to describe someone who holds a similar position.
