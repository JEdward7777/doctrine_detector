They provided detailed explanations for each term and their historical context, which shows a good level of knowledge. However, the response focused more on the distinctiveness and nuances of the terms rather than their interchangeable usage, which was the primary concern of the question. Though the additional information was informative, the focus could have been more aligned with the concern stated."
