## [Answer](../Terminology_in_the_Bible.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of biblical studies! While I'm a scholar, not a theologian, I'll do my best to provide an answer that avoids any assumptions about divine intervention.

In the Bible, three terms are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people. These terms are:

1. Israel (יִשְׂרָאֵל) - This term refers specifically to the descendants of Jacob, who was renamed Israel after wrestling with an angel (Genesis 32:28). The name "Israel" is often used to describe the entire nation of God's chosen people.
2. Jews (יְהוּדִים) - This term originally referred to the post-exilic community that returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian captivity (Ezra 6:17). Over time, it came to refer specifically to the descendants of Judah, one of Jacob's sons.
3. Hebrews (עִבְרִים) - This term is often used interchangeably with "Israelites" or "Jews." It refers to those who speak Hebrew as their native language and are descended from Abraham.

These terms are not always clearly distinguished in the Bible, which can lead to confusion. However, by understanding the historical context and linguistic nuances of each term, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complexities of biblical culture and history.
