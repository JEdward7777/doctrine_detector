  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a well-researched and insightful analysis of the significance of testimony in the context of biblical commandments, they missed the central focus on the tablets of stone as the embodiment of God's commandments as mentioned in the reference answer. While the student's explanation enriches the understanding of testimony and its importance in the biblical context, a more explicit connection to the physical representation of God's commandments as testimony would have strengthened their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
