  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the answer attempts to provide a scholarly and reasoned perspective on the concept of not putting God to the test, it does not address the question from a Christian worldview. The response lacks doctrinal correctness and fails to emphasize the foundational reason why putting God to the test is considered wrong in Christianity, which is fundamentally rooted in the sin of presumption and the call to trust in God's sovereignty and wisdom. The student's answer is informative but lacks theological depth and specific reference to Christian doctrine on this topic."
