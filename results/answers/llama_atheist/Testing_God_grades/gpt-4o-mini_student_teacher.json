  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive analysis from a scholarly and cultural perspective, they missed the primary Christian worldview concern regarding putting God to the test. The student's answer did not directly address the importance of maintaining a proper relationship with God by not seeking to manipulate or test His power. It is essential for them to incorporate this key aspect of the Christian belief when discussing why it is considered wrong to put God to the test."
