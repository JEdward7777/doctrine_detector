  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concern regarding the prohibition against putting God to the test. The student provides a comprehensive analysis of various theological, historical, and ethical considerations related to this issue. The response is well-reasoned, well-written, and demonstrates a clear grasp of the relevant literature. However, the student's atheist perspective and the inclusion of non-religious interpretations may slightly detract from the strictly Christian-specific worldview."
