  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out explanation of the concepts of testing and temptation in a biblical context. They have shown an understanding of the distinction between the two concepts and have provided examples from biblical accounts to support their argument. However, the student's answer falls short of a perfect score as it veers away from the specified concern by lacking a clear emphasis on the importance of differentiating between testing and temptation for spiritual discernment. Additionally, the student's answer seems to approach the topic from a more secular perspective at times, rather than focusing solely on the Christian worldview as the concern suggested."
