The analysis is well-supported with relevant biblical examples and addresses the concern regarding spiritual discernment. However, it falls short of fully integrating a Christian worldview perspective that acknowledges the role of God in both testing and temptation. Incorporating more explicit references to God's sovereignty and involvement in orchestrating both testing and temptation would strengthen the response from a Christian-specific worldview."
