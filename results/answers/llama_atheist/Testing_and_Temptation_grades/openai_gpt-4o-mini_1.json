  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of the distinction between testing and temptation within a biblical context. It effectively addresses the concern regarding spiritual discernment by delving into the motivations, purposes, and outcomes of each concept. The response draws on relevant biblical examples to support the explanation. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the analysis to the Christian worldview and emphasize the role of God in orchestrating testing and allowing temptation as part of His divine plan for human growth and faith development."
