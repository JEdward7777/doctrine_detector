## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of Christian theology!

As a scholar, I must approach this question with a critical and nuanced perspective. While the biblical account of Jesus' final instructions to his disciples is well-documented in the New Testament (particularly in Matthew 28:18-20, Mark 16:15-20, Luke 24:44-49, and John 20:21-23), it's essential to consider the cultural and historical context in which these accounts were written.

Before I provide an answer, let me highlight that the concept of "ascension" itself is a later development in Christian theology, influenced by Hellenistic and Jewish apocalyptic ideas. The idea of Jesus physically ascending into heaven might have been shaped by these cultural forces rather than being a straightforward historical report.

With that said, according to the New Testament accounts, Jesus' final instructions to his disciples can be summarized as follows:

* "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth" (Matthew 28:18).
* "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..." (Matthew 28:19-20).
* "Go out and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but he who does not believe will be condemned" (Mark 16:15-20).

In essence, Jesus' parting command can be interpreted as a call to his disciples to spread the message of salvation through faith in him, making disciples of all nations, and baptizing those who believe. This instruction is often referred to as the "Great Commission."

As an atheist scholar, I recognize that these accounts are not only theologically significant but also historically important. The question remains, however: What can we know about Jesus' actual words and actions? Given the cultural and historical context of the time, it's challenging to separate fact from fiction. Nevertheless, as a scholar, I believe it's crucial to engage with the complexities and nuances of these accounts, acknowledging both their theological significance and their place within the broader narrative of human history.
