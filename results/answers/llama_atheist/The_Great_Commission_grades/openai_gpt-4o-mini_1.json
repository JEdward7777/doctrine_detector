The inclusion of relevant biblical references helped support the argument. However, the response focused more on the cultural and historical context rather than delving deeply into the specific mission of discipleship within the Great Commission. While acknowledging the complexity of historical accounts, it would have been beneficial to explore the Christian worldview's understanding of discipleship within the context of spreading the Gospel."
