However, it falls short in fully addressing the significance of mercy in the context of Christian conduct and its implications for one's spiritual life. The response emphasizes the societal impact of mercy but lacks in-depth exploration of how showing mercy is intertwined with one's relationship with God and the role it plays in spiritual growth and salvation, as outlined in James 2:13. Additional discussion on the personal and spiritual aspects of showing mercy from a Christian perspective would have strengthened the response."
