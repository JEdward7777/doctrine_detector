## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets to the heart of Christian theology! As an atheist, I'll do my best to provide a neutral, cultural-historical analysis.

In the New Testament of the Bible, "Jesus" is the name given to the central figure of Christianity, also known as Jesus of Nazareth. It's believed that this name was derived from the Hebrew name "Yeshua," which means "God is salvation." In Greek, it became "Iēsous" (Ἰησοῦς), and in Latin, "Jesus."

The term "Christ," on the other hand, has its roots in the Greek title "Christos" (Χριστός). This title was used to refer to Jesus as the Messiah, or the anointed one. In Hebrew, this concept is represented by the word "Messiah" (מָשִׁיחַ), which means "anointed one." The Greek term "Christos" is derived from the Hebrew word "Mashiach" (מָשִׁיעַ), which means "to anoint."

In Christian theology, Jesus is seen as the Christ because he is believed to be the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. The term "Christ" is often used interchangeably with "Messiah," and it's considered a synonym for "Savior." In this sense, "Jesus Christ" refers to the figure who is both human (Jesus) and divine (Christ), and who is seen as having brought salvation to humanity through his teachings, death, and resurrection.

From a historical perspective, it's worth noting that the term "Christ" was not originally a name but rather a title or an epithet. It was used by early Christians to refer to Jesus before he was fully identified with the title. Over time, as Christianity developed and spread, the two terms became increasingly linked, and "Jesus Christ" became the standard way of referring to the central figure of Christian faith.

I hope this helps!
