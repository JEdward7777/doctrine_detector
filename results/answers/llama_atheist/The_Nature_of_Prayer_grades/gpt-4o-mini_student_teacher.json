  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-written and thoughtful, does not address the concern of understanding the proper approach to prayer and distinguishing it from false practices from a Christian worldview. The answer focuses more on a secular and atheistic perspective on prayer, cultural practices, and human behavior. It lacks an analysis of prayer as a form of spiritual communion with God and does not differentiate between genuine prayer to the Christian God and talking to false gods."
