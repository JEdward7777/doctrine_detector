However, it fails to address the concern presented, which is to understand the proper approach to prayer and distinguish it from false practices. While acknowledging the diversity of human experiences and the importance of religious practices, the response does not affirm the Christian worldview regarding prayer as a spiritual communion with the one true God. From a Christian perspective, prayer involves a genuine relationship with God, not just a cultural or psychological phenomenon."
