  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the concept of prayer from an atheistic perspective and attempts to analyze it as a cultural phenomenon. While the response shows an understanding of the diversity of human beliefs and practices, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of distinguishing between the proper approach to prayer and false practices. The response focuses more on the cultural and psychological aspects of prayer rather than providing a clear distinction between genuine prayer to God and talking to false gods. To improve the grade, the response would need to better address the concern raised in the prompt."
