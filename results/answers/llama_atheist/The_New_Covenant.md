## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating question!

When we examine the concept of God writing his law on people's hearts in the New Covenant, I think it's essential to approach this through a more nuanced and culturally retributed lens.

In Jeremiah 31:31-34, Jesus quotes from this passage, proclaiming that he will establish a new covenant with Israel. In this context, "writing God's law on our hearts" is not about literal inscriptions or even mental recall. Instead, it might be seen as a metaphor for the transformative power of divine presence in people's lives.

To better understand this concept, let's explore some biblical and cultural parallels:

1. Ancient Near Eastern treaties: In ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, treaties between gods and humans often included stipulations that the god would inscribe his laws on the human's heart. This symbolized a deep transformation within the person, making them more attuned to the divine will.
2. Hebraic wisdom: The Hebrew Bible itself contains passages like Proverbs 3:5-6 ("Trust in the Lord with all your heart... and he will make straight your paths"), where trust is seen as a fundamental aspect of living in harmony with God's laws.

In light of these cultural and biblical contexts, the idea that God would write his law on our hearts might be reinterpreted as follows:

When Jesus says "I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts" (Jeremiah 31:33), he might be proclaiming a new era where people's very being is transformed by their relationship with God. This "writing" could represent the internalization of moral values, making them an integral part of one's identity.

In this view, the law is no longer something external to be followed or memorized; rather, it becomes an intrinsic aspect of who we are as humans, reflecting our union with God. This understanding harmonizes with Jesus' teachings on love and compassion, emphasizing that these values are not just moral principles but an expression of being in harmony with the divine.

In summary, when God writes his law on our hearts, it might be seen as a metaphor for the transformative power of divine presence, where people's very being is reshaped by their relationship with God. This retributed understanding encourages us to explore the biblical and cultural contexts surrounding this concept, ultimately revealing a more nuanced and meaningful interpretation.

How do you think we can further unpack this idea in light of our cultural context?
