  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the concept of God writing His law on people's hearts in the New Covenant, drawing upon biblical passages and cultural parallels. The student effectively explores the metaphorical aspect of this notion and its implications on personal transformation and relationship with God. However, while the response demonstrates good critical thinking and integration of different perspectives, it could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian doctrine of the New Covenant and how this concept relates to Christ's sacrifice and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Additionally, the inclusion of more Scriptural references specifically related to the New Covenant could further strengthen the argument."
