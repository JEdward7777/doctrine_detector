  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student provides a thorough and well-explained analysis of what it means for believers to be glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. They effectively incorporate relevant scripture references and explain key concepts such as identification with Christ, sinless existence, transformation, exaltation, and unmediated relationship with God. \n\nHowever, there is a minor oversight in the interpretation of Philippians 3:20-21. The passage is actually focused on the future hope of believers in the resurrection and transformation of their bodies to be like Christ's glorious body, rather than solely on their adoption as sons. \n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic but could benefit from a more accurate interpretation of certain passages."
