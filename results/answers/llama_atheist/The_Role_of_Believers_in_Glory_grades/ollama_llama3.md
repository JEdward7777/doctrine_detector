A question that requires a nuanced and informed response!

The concept of being "glorified with Christ" originates from Pauline theology, specifically in Philippians 3:20-21, where he writes: "For our commonwealth is in heaven, and we are exiles from the suffering of humanity, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, when the redemption will have its glorious effect. For we know that if our earthly dwelling has a tent-like quality, we ourselves are not at home here. We eagerly await the creation of heavenly dwellings."

In this passage, Paul emphasizes the believers' future hope in Jesus Christ, where they will be fully adopted as God's children and experience the fullness of redemption. This "glorious effect" is closely tied to Christ's own glorification, which occurred at his resurrection (John 17:5).

Throughout the New Testament, there are various descriptions of what it means for believers to be glorified with Christ:

1. **Identification with Christ**: Believers share in Christ's resurrection and glorification, becoming one with him in an eternal, spiritual reality (Romans 6:4-5). This union is often described as being "in Christ" or "with Christ."
2. **Sinless existence**: As believers are conformed to Christ's image (Romans 8:29), they become sinless and holy, reflecting God's glory (1 Corinthians 15:52-54).
3. **Transformation**: The glorification process is often seen as a transformation from the current fallen state to an eternal, heavenly one, where believers will possess resurrected bodies (Philippians 3:21; Revelation 21:4).
4. **Exaltation**: As Christ was exalted to God's right hand (Acts 2:33), believers are raised up with him and share in his glorious, exalted status (Ephesians 2:6; Colossians 1:13-14).
5. **Unmediated relationship with God**: In the new creation, believers will have direct access to God, without any intermediary (John 17:5; Revelation 22:4).

In summary, being "glorified with Christ" means that believers will share in his resurrection, sinless existence, and exalted status. They will be transformed into a heavenly state, having an unmediated relationship with God, and experience the fullness of redemption.

Now, I'm no theologian, but this is what the New Testament suggests!

Grade: 80

This response provides a good foundation for understanding what it means to be "glorified with Christ." The writer correctly identifies the concept as being rooted in Pauline theology and provides biblical support from Philippians 3:20-21 and other passages.

However, while the response does touch on some of the aspects involved in being glorified with Christ, such as transformation and sharing in Jesus' eternal glory, it could be more comprehensive. For instance, the idea that believers will share in Christ's sinless existence and have an unmediated relationship with God are important nuances that are not fully explored.

Furthermore, the response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the significance of this hope for believers' faith and perseverance, as specified in the concern. While the writer mentions that understanding this concept is "vital," it would be helpful to see more explicit connections drawn between the promise of glory and the encouragement it offers for living out one's faith.

Overall, while the response is a good start, it could be strengthened by providing more detail and emphasizing the practical implications of being glorified with Christ.
