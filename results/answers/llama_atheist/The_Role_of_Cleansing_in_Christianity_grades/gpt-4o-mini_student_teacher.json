  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of the concept of cleansing in the Bible, linking both Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings effectively. They have demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of Jesus' teachings on sin, redemption, and cleansing. However, there is room for improvement in explicitly tying the concept of cleansing to the redemptive work of Christ in a more direct and concise manner, as emphasized in the reference answer."
