  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response receives high marks for several reasons:\n\n1. It effectively addresses the concern by exploring the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings, highlighting how Jesus' teachings on sin and redemption offer a radical departure from the Old Testament understanding of cleansing.\n2. The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the concept of \"cleansing\" in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, demonstrating an understanding of the cultural and historical contexts that shape the text.\n3. The discussion is well-organized, with a logical flow from the Old Testament to the New Testament, and the examples from John 13:1-10 and Luke 11:37-41 are effectively used to illustrate Jesus' teachings on cleansing.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the response's conclusion, which could be more explicitly connected to the concern. While the response does address the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings, it could be further emphasized in the concluding paragraph. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical concept of \"cleansing\" and its significance in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament.\n\nGrade: 95"
