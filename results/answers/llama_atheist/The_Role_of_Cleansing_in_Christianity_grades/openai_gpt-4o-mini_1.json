  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response effectively connects the given answer about the concept of \"cleansing\" in the Bible to the concern of understanding the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of this relationship by discussing how Jesus' teachings in the New Testament recontextualize the concept of cleansing from mere ritual purity to an emphasis on inner transformation and reconciliation with God through faith in Christ. The response provides solid biblical references and analysis to support the argument, showing a deep engagement with the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
