However, the viewpoint disregards the foundational belief in God's sovereignty and divine purpose in appointing leaders within Christian theology. The response lacks acknowledgment of God's role in selecting leaders for His people and the implications of this belief for the Christian community. Integrating the Christian-specific worldview of God's sovereignty and His divine plans for leadership would have significantly enhanced the response."
