The response disregards the foundational belief that God's selection is based on His divine purpose and plans, as stated in the given answer. Additionally, the explanation focuses purely on human interpretations and cultural contexts, neglecting the spiritual dimension of God's interaction with His chosen leaders. The viewpoint lacks acknowledgment of the significance of faith in understanding God's actions within the Christian community."
