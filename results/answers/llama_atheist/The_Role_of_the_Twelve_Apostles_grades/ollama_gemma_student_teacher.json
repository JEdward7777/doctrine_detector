  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the significance of the Twelve Apostles from a historical and cultural perspective. \n\nWhile the answer does not explicitly address the Christian perspective as requested, it provides a well-researched and comprehensive analysis of the apostles' roles as witnesses, leaders, regional representatives, symbolic figures, and historical record-keepers. \n\nHowever, it would have strengthened the answer to acknowledge the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, as per the given concern."
