However, it falls short in fully recognizing the theological and spiritual significance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. While it does touch on some crucial aspects such as witnesses, leadership development, and symbolic significance, it overlooks the essential role of the apostles in laying the foundation of the Christian faith, spreading the gospel, and serving as pillars of the early church. Integrating a deeper understanding of the apostles' spiritual calling and their impact on Christian belief and ministry would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview."
