However, the response lacks recognition of the apostles' divine commission by Jesus and their foundational role in Christian belief and ministry, which is essential in a Christian worldview. There is an excellent analysis of their impact on spreading Christianity, but the absence of acknowledging their divine calling slightly hinders the overall evaluation."
