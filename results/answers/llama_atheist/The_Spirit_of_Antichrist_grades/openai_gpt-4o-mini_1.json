From a Christian worldview, the understanding of the spirit of antichrist is critical for believers to discern and resist false teachings that go against the work of Jesus Christ. The response, while informative, does not emphasize the significance of this vigilance for Christians, thus reducing its relevance from a Christian worldview perspective."
