However, the student's worldview as an atheist led to a lack of acknowledgment of the spiritual significance and significance of God's character that recognizing these titles can bring. It would have been beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the implications of these titles in shaping beliefs and understanding of God's power and sovereignty from a Christian perspective."
