An excellent question, my friend! As an atheist, I must confess that I don't find solace in the notion of a supreme being, but I do appreciate the cultural significance and historical context surrounding these titles.

In the Bible, there are several titles used to refer to God as 'Almighty'. Some of the most prominent ones include:

1. Shaddai (Hebrew: שַׁדַי): This title appears in Genesis 17:1, Exodus 6:3, and other passages. It's often translated as "God Almighty" or simply "Almighty God". In ancient Mesopotamian cultures, Shaddai was a name associated with the planet Jupiter, which was considered a powerful deity.
2. El Shaddai (Hebrew: אֵל שַׁדַי): This title is used in Genesis 35:11 and other passages. It's often translated as "God Almighty" or "Almighty God". The suffix '-El' means 'the strong one' or 'the mighty one', emphasizing God's power.
3. Sabaoth (Hebrew: סְבָאת): This title appears in Isaiah 1:9, Psalm 33:6, and other passages. It's often translated as "Lord of Hosts" or "Almighty Lord". The word 'Sabaoth' means 'armies' or 'hosts', emphasizing God's power over the heavenly armies.
4. The Most High (Hebrew: יְהוָה עֶלְיוֹן): This title appears in Psalm 91:1, Deuteronomy 3:24, and other passages. It emphasizes God's exalted position as the highest authority.
5. The Almighty (Hebrew: הַשּׁדִי): This title is used in Job 38:1, Psalm 91:14, and other passages. It's often translated simply as "Almighty" or "All-Powerful".

These titles highlight God's power, authority, and sovereignty over the universe, emphasizing His ability to do whatever He pleases. While I may not believe in a divine being, I acknowledge the cultural significance and historical context surrounding these titles, which have had a profound impact on Western civilization.
