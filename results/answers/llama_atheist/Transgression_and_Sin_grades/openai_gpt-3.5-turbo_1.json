While the analysis of transgression from psychological and sociological perspectives is insightful, the absence of acknowledging the spiritual implications of sin and disobedience from a Christian worldview significantly detracts from the depth and accuracy of the response. Integrating the spiritual dimension would have provided a more holistic understanding of the concept of transgression."
