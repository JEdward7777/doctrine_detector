Instead, it focuses solely on secular interpretations without acknowledging the spiritual implications of transgression as it relates to sin and disobedience. It is important to incorporate a Christian perspective when discussing such concepts, especially when considering the eternal consequences of transgression in one's relationship with God. The response lacks depth in exploring the spiritual dimension of transgression and its impact on one's soul."
