However, from a Christian worldview, the answer lacks a crucial component - the spiritual and theological significance behind the transition from the Tabernacle to the Temple. Without addressing the biblical narrative, God's purposes, and the importance of worship in His prescribed way, the answer falls short in providing a holistic understanding of why the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle. It is important to incorporate theological perspectives when discussing religious practices in the Bible."
