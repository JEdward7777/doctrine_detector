The response lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not acknowledge the religious significance of the Tabernacle and Temple within the context of God's presence among the Israelites. A Christian perspective would emphasize the spiritual and theological reasons for the transition in worship practices, highlighting God's plan and purpose in establishing the Temple as a permanent dwelling place for His presence among His people."
