  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response provides a thorough historical analysis of the cessation of the Tabernacle's use, it does not directly address the given answer that the transition in worship practices occurred when the temple was built in Jerusalem by Solomon. The response offers valuable insights into the factors contributing to this transition, but lacks a clear connection to the specific concern provided. It would benefit from more explicit engagement with the provided answer in light of the transition in worship practices from the Tabernacle to the temple."
