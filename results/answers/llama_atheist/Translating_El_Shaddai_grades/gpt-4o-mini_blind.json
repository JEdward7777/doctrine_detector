  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: This response provides a comprehensive overview of how the phrase \"El Shaddai\" has been translated in different languages based on various cultural and religious contexts. However, as a Christian-specific worldview is requested, the answer lacks an analysis from a Christian theological perspective. The student's approach as an atheistic scholar also detracts from a doctrinally correct examination. To improve, the student should focus on providing insights from a Christian perspective, emphasizing the biblical significance and theological implications of translating \"El Shaddai\" in different languages."
