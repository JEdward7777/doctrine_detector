  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough exploration of various translations of \"El Shaddai\" in different languages, which shows a good grasp of cultural adaptations. However, the student did not address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages from a Christian worldview. In a Christian perspective, maintaining the essence of God's character and attributes, such as His almighty nature, should be prioritized in translations. The student's focus on linguistic and cultural nuances, although interesting, did not fully align with the Christian concern provided."
