The fascinating topic of divine names and their cultural adaptations!

In Jewish tradition, El Shaddai (אֵל שַׁדַּי) is one of the most important names of God, emphasizing His role as a provider and nurturer. As an atheistic scholar, I'll approach this question from a neutral perspective, examining various cultural translations of the Bible to shed light on the nuances of rendering "El Shaddai" in different languages.

1. Hebrew: The original text (Genesis 17:1, Exodus 6:3) uses the term אֵל שַׁדַּי, which can be translated as "God Almighty" or "The All-Sufficient One." This name is often associated with God's power and provision.
2. Greek (Septuagint): In the Septuagint, El Shaddai becomes Θεός Σοφός (Theos Sophos), meaning "Wisdom of God" or "God, Wisdom."
3. Latin Vulgate: Jerome's Latin translation renders El Shaddai as Deus Omnipotens, equivalent to "Almighty God" in English.
4. Aramaic: In the Peshitta, a Syriac Bible written in Aramaic script, El Shaddai appears as ܗܘܐ ܫܕܐ (Hwā Shadda), which can be translated as "God of Providence" or "Provider God."
5. Ethiopian Ge'ez: In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church's ancient language, Ge'ez, El Shaddai is written as አል ሥዳ (Al Sada). This name is often rendered as "The Almighty One" or "The All-Powerful One."
6. Arabic: In Islamic traditions, El Shaddai is sometimes referred to as القهار (al-Qahhar), which means "The Powerful" or "The Mighty One." However, this term is not universally accepted among all Muslim scholars.
7. Chinese: In some Chinese translations of the Bible, El Shaddai appears as (Shàngdì Zūnshèng), meaning "The Almighty God" or "The All-Powerful God."
8. Japanese: The name El Shaddai is sometimes translated as (Sēddai-sha), which can be interpreted as "The God of Abundance" or "The Nurturing God."

In summary, the phrase "El Shaddai" has been rendered in various ways across different languages and cultures, reflecting local connotations and theological understandings. While some translations emphasize God's power (e.g., Latin Vulgate), others highlight His providence (e.g., Aramaic Peshitta) or nurturing nature (e.g., Ethiopian Ge'ez). As an atheistic scholar, I'm intrigued by the diverse ways humans have attempted to describe and relate to their understanding of a higher power.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a thorough exploration of various translations of "El Shaddai" in different languages, which shows a good grasp of cultural adaptations. However, the student did not address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages from a Christian worldview. In a Christian perspective, maintaining the essence of God's character and attributes, such as His almighty nature, should be prioritized in translations. The student's focus on linguistic and cultural nuances, although interesting, did not fully align with the Christian concern provided.
