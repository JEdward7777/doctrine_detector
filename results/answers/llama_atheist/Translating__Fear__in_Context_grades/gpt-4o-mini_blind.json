The explanations provided are informative and show a good level of research and thoughtfulness. However, the response could benefit from a stronger connection to the importance of these translations specifically within a Christian context, as the question pertains to understanding God in a Christian worldview. Integrating more explicitly Christian theological perspectives would enhance the overall depth and relevance of the answer."
