  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive exploration of the translations of 'fear' in reference to God across different cultures and languages. They have demonstrated an understanding of the importance of cultural sensitivity and theological nuance in translating this term. However, the student's answer lacks focus on the concern raised about potential misinterpretation of 'fear' leading to a distorted view of God. Additionally, the response could have been more concise and directly addressed the significance of understanding these translations in cultivating a proper attitude towards God."
