  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the importance of retaining certain terminology in biblical translations. They provide several compelling arguments, including the historical significance, literary coherence, cultural resonance, interfaith dialogue, and preservation of linguistic diversity. \n\nHowever, the response would benefit from a more explicit statement aligning with the Christian worldview referenced in the prompt. The student's conclusion remains neutral and avoids taking a definitive stance on the importance of retaining these terms from a Christian perspective."
