The points made by the response align well with the concern of adequately preserving the rich figurative meanings and connection to Biblical heritage and teachings. Additionally, the response acknowledges the historical, literary, theological, and cultural importance of these terms, reflecting a depth of understanding in maintaining the integrity of the biblical narrative within a translation context. The only area for improvement would be to consider how a Christian-specific worldview would emphasize the necessity of accurately conveying the spiritual truths and divine revelation contained within the original biblical text when discussing the importance of these terms."
