  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 60. \n\nWhile the answer provides some thoughtful insights and interpretations of the concept of \"image of God\" applied to humans and Jesus, as an atheist scholar, the perspective lacks the doctrinal correctness and theological depth that would be expected from a Christian worldview. The answer also does not engage with the Christian belief in the ontological significance of being created in the image of God and the theological implications of Jesus being the perfect image of God. Additionally, there is an absence of Scriptural references to support the interpretations presented. \n\nMoving forward, the student could benefit from engaging more deeply with Christian theological perspectives on the subject and incorporating relevant biblical passages to support their interpretations."
