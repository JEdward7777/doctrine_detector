The inclusion of various interpretations and their significance adds depth to the discussion, addressing the concern about exploring the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings. The response could be further enhanced by incorporating more explicit references to Christian beliefs and scriptures to strengthen the Christian-specific worldview aspect."
