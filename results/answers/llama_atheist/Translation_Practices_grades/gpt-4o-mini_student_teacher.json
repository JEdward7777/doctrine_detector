  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the historical and cultural reasons behind using \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in Bible translations. Their response showed respect for the reverence for God's name and the traditions that have influenced this practice. However, the answer could have been more concise and directly tied back to the concern of clarity in translation and maintaining reverence for God's name, as stated in the question prompt. Overall, a solid response with room for improvement in focusing on the specified concern."
