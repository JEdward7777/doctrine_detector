## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A great question! As an atheist scholar, I'll dive into the linguistic and cultural contexts of the ancient Mediterranean world to provide some alternative translations that reflect the biblical meaning of "to be zealous."

In the biblical context, "zeal" (Hebrew: קִינּוֹת, kivvot) often connotes a strong emotional commitment or passion, particularly for God's law, His people, or His house. It can also imply a sense of fervent devotion, enthusiasm, and even righteous indignation.

Here are some alternative translations that aim to capture the essence of biblical zeal:

1. To be consumed by passion: This translation emphasizes the intense emotional drive behind zeal, highlighting its ability to shape one's actions and decisions.
Example: "And they were consumed by a passion for the Lord" (Deuteronomy 6:5).
2. To demonstrate fervent devotion: This phrase captures the idea of showing a deep commitment or enthusiasm for a particular cause, which is often characteristic of biblical zeal.
Example: "The people demonstrated their fervent devotion to God's law" (Joshua 24:23).
3. To exhibit righteous indignation: In some cases, biblical zeal can manifest as a strong sense of moral outrage against injustice or wrongdoing. This translation conveys that intensity and moral urgency.
Example: "Jesus exhibited righteous indignation at the money changers in the temple" (Matthew 21:12).
4. To be intensely loyal: Zeal can also imply unwavering loyalty to a person, cause, or community. This translation emphasizes the depth of commitment involved.
Example: "The people were intensely loyal to their city and its gods" (2 Kings 17:16).
5. To show unyielding dedication: This phrase highlights the idea that biblical zeal often involves an unwavering commitment to a particular path or pursuit, even in the face of adversity.
Example: "The prophet showed unyielding dedication to proclaiming God's word" (Jeremiah 1:2).

Keep in mind that these translations are not direct equivalents but rather attempts to capture the cultural and linguistic nuances surrounding the concept of biblical zeal.
