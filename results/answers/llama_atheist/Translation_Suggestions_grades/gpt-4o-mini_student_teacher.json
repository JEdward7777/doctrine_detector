  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the biblical concept of zeal and provided well-thought-out alternative translations that reflect its intensity and commitment. However, the response lacked specificity and direct comparison to the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, the student's perspective as an atheist scholar may have influenced their interpretation, potentially missing the depth and spiritual significance of zeal within a Christian worldview. A stronger connection to Christian teachings and a more direct alignment with the reference answer would have improved the grade."
