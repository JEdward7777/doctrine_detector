The student provides several insightful and relevant alternative translations that capture the intensity and multifaceted nature of this concept. The inclusion of examples from scripture further enhances the quality of the response. However, the answer would benefit from a closer alignment with the Christian specific worldview by referencing relevant biblical passages and theological interpretations of zeal."
