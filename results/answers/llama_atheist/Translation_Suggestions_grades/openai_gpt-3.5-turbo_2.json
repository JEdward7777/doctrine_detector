The translation options presented align well with the concern of understanding the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith. However, as an atheist scholar, the response could potentially lack a deeper insight into the spiritual significance and divine inspiration underlying the concept of zeal in Christianity from a Christian worldview perspective."
