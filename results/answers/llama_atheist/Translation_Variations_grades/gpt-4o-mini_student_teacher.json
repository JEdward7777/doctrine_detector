  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nWhile the student did an excellent job exploring various alternative translations for the term \"covenant faithfulness\" and providing thoughtful reflections on how these translations could resonate across different cultural and religious backgrounds, the grade is lower as the student did not directly address the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student's response is comprehensive and shows a deep understanding of the topic, but incorporating and acknowledging the provided reference answer would have further enhanced the response. Overall, the student demonstrated critical thinking and showcased a thorough exploration of the topic."
