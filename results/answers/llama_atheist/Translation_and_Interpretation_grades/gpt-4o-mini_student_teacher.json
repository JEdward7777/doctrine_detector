  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and comprehensive analysis of how the term \"Lord\" is understood in different cultural contexts, however, the answer lacks a clear distinction between the translation of \"Lord\" when referring to God versus ordinary people as specified in the concern. Additionally, the Christian specific worldview is missing in the response, focusing more on cultural and linguistic perspectives. To improve the grade, the student should have emphasized the importance of accurate translation and interpretation of biblical terms in shaping one's understanding of God within the Christian worldview."
