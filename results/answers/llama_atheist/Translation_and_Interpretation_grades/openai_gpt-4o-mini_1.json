The response does not specifically engage with how the translation of \"Lord\" as a title for God carries theological significance in Christian theology, which is crucial when discussing the nature of God according to biblical teachings. A stronger connection to the Christian worldview and the importance of accurately conveying the divine attributes associated with the term \"Lord\" would have enhanced the response."
