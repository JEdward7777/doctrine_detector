What a timely and pertinent question!

In the biblical context, the term "abomination" (Hebrew: to'evah; Greek: bdelyktos) is often used to describe something or someone that is considered repugnant, detestable, or morally reprehensible. To effectively translate this term, we must consider its cultural and historical context.

In ancient Hebrew culture, the concept of "abomination" was closely tied to religious purity and ritual cleanliness. The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) distinguishes between clean and unclean animals, with clean animals being fit for sacrifice or consumption. In this sense, an abomination would be an animal that was considered unclean or unfit for worship.

When the term "abomination" is used in a broader moral sense, it often refers to actions or behaviors that are contrary to God's will or law. This can include idolatry, false worship, and other forms of disobedience. In this context, an abomination would be an act or practice that is considered morally repugnant.

In modern translations, the term "abomination" is often rendered as something like "detestable thing," "horrible thing," or "repulsive thing." However, this can lose some of the original cultural and religious nuance. A more culturally sensitive translation might use terms like "something to be shunned" or "something abhorrent."

To further illustrate the meaning of "abomination" in a biblical context, consider Jesus' teaching in Mark 7:21-22:

"For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughtsâ€”murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander. These are the things which defile a man."

Here, Jesus is using the concept of "abomination" to describe internal sinful desires and behaviors that are contrary to God's will. In this sense, an abomination would be an internal corruption or moral decay that can only be addressed through spiritual transformation.

In conclusion, when considering the biblical term "abomination," we must recognize its cultural and historical context as well as its broader moral implications. A culturally sensitive translation might emphasize the concept of ritual uncleanness, moral repugnance, or internal corruption, depending on the specific context in which it is used.
