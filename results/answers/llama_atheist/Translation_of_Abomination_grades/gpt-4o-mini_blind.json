The inclusion of the distinction between clean and unclean animals, as well as the connection to ritual purity and moral disobedience, is commendable. Additionally, referencing Jesus' teaching to illustrate the concept was a good choice. The response could have further emphasized the gravity of abominations in God's eyes and the importance of repentance in addressing them. Overall, a well-rounded answer with good theological depth."
