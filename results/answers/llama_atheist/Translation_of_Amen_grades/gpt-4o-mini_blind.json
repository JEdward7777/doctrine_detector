  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough exploration of the potential translations of \"truly\" as used by Jesus, taking into account cultural and historical contexts. The response offers a variety of nuanced translations with explanations, demonstrating a good understanding of the complexity of the phrase. The inclusion of the significance of \"amen\" in ancient Jewish culture adds depth to the analysis. For a higher grade, the answer could have further emphasized the theological implications of Jesus' usage of \"truly\" and provided more connections to specific biblical passages where this phrase is used. Overall, a solid and informative response."
