  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80 out of 100. The student provides a thorough analysis of potential translations for \"truly\" as used by Jesus, considering cultural and historical contexts. They offer a variety of translations that capture different nuances and implications of the phrase. While the student's answer is well-researched and informative, it slightly lacks in explicitly emphasizing the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation, which was the specified concern. Encouraging the student to align their analysis more directly with the significance of precise translation in biblical interpretation could enhance the response."
