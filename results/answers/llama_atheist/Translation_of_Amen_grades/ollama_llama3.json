  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nThis response does not directly address the concern about understanding the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation, but it does provide a thorough exploration of the nuances of the Greek phrase \"amen lego\" and its various translations. The discussion is thoughtful and insightful, and the inclusion of historical and cultural context adds depth to the analysis.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger by explicitly connecting the different translations back to the concern about accurate biblical translation and interpretation. For example, it would have been helpful to discuss how understanding the cultural significance of \"amen\" can inform our approach to translating Jesus' words, or how being aware of the various nuances of \"amen lego\" can help us avoid misinterpretation.\n\nOverall, while this response is well-written and engaging, it could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern about accurate biblical translation and interpretation."
