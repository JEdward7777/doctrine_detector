However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of clarifying the spiritual implications of being \"begotten\" for believers, as it does not explicitly connect the concept to the idea of being spiritually born again in Christ. The response would be stronger with a more explicit tie-in to the Christian worldview and the significance of \"begotten\" within that context."
