  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"Lord Yahweh\" in different languages, which demonstrates effort and research. However, the answer lacks focus on maintaining the accurate meaning of the term while considering the specific concern of conveying the titles and presence of God in Scripture. Additionally, by approaching the question from an atheist perspective and omitting the importance of grammatical structure in translation, the student's answer falls short of fully addressing the concern provided."
