  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and informative response explaining the nuances between the Hebrew term Sheol and the Greek term Hades in biblical contexts. They recommended appropriate translation options for both terms and demonstrated a good understanding of the cultural and theological considerations involved. However, a more explicit connection to biblical principles or Christian doctrine relating to the concepts of Sheol and Hades could have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
