  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a deep understanding of the complexities surrounding the translation of biblical terms 'Sheol' and 'Hades'. They provide detailed explanations of the nuances of these terms in Hebrew and Greek contexts, as well as offer modern translation options that respect their biblical meanings. The student's recommendations align well with the concern of ensuring accurate biblical representation in translations. However, the response could be improved by simplifying the language and focusing more on directly addressing the concern, rather than delving into scholarly analysis."
