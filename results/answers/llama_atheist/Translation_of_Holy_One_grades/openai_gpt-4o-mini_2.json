It recognizes the importance of accurately representing the term to maintain its theological significance. The various approaches and considerations presented demonstrate a thorough understanding of the topic from a theological perspective. However, there could be a bit more emphasis on the distinctiveness of the term in a Christian context specifically, to fully align with a Christian worldview."
