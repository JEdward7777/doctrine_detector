  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a comprehensive and well-researched response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of \"predestined\" from a Christian perspective. The suggested translations are accurate and appropriate, and the discussion of determinism vs. free will, the role of chance and probability, and the concept of a \"plan\" or \"course\" is insightful and relevant to a secular context. The student's ability to bridge cultural and linguistic gaps is commendable."
