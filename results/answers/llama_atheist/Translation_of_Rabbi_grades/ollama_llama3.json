  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides a thoughtful and detailed approach to translating the term \"Rabbi\" into various languages, it does not directly address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The response focuses more on cultural sensitivity, linguistic precision, and interfaith dialogue, which are all important considerations for translation. However, it does not specifically examine how to accurately represent Jesus' teachings and role as a teacher within the Christian context.\n\nThe given answer provides a good starting point by emphasizing the importance of respecting the title's significance while also acknowledging the need to conform to local customs and norms in the target language. While the response touches on some of these points, it could be improved by providing more explicit guidance on how to accurately represent Jesus' teachings and role as a teacher within the Christian faith.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response would need to provide more direct connections between the translation approach and the accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith."
