  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of translating the term \"Rabbi\" into various languages, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The response does not specifically address how the translation should respect the significance of Jesus as a teacher and should align with how teachers are typically addressed in the target language, as per the given answer and concern. Therefore, there is a disconnect between the detailed analysis provided and the specific concern raised."
