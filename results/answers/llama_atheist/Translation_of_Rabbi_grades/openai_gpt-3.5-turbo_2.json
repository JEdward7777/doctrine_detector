However, it falls short in addressing the concern of accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The response did not explicitly tie the translation to Jesus' unique role beyond being a teacher and how this should be reflected in the translation to uphold his divinity and significance. A more explicit connection to the Christian worldview and the importance of maintaining the proper reverence for Jesus in the translation would have strengthened the response."
