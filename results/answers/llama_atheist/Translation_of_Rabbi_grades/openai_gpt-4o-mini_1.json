  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides a thorough exploration of the complexities involved in translating the term \"Rabbi\" into various languages, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The focus of the response is more on cultural and linguistic considerations rather than specifically addressing how Jesus as a Rabbi should be faithfully represented in translations. To improve the grade, the response could have included more direct references to the unique theological significance of Jesus as Rabbi and how translations should capture this without diminishing His role as a divine teacher within the Christian worldview."
