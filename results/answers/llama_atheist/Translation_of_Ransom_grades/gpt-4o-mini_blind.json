While the answer is informative and well-organized, it lacks depth in addressing the theological significance of \"ransom\" in Christian doctrine. From a Christian worldview, the term \"ransom\" carries profound implications related to redemption and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ to liberate humanity from sin, which should have been mentioned. Encouraging the student to consider incorporating theological insights alongside their linguistic analysis to provide a more holistic perspective on the term \"ransom.\""
