As a Christian, it is important to emphasize the theological significance of \"ransom\" in relation to Jesus Christ paying the price for humanity's redemption. The student's approach, while informative from a linguistic and cultural perspective, lacks a Christian worldview in interpreting the term \"ransom.\""
