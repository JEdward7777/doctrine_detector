As a Christian, it is essential to ensure that the theological significance of the term \"ransom\" is preserved in translation, emphasizing the sacrificial and atoning nature of Christ's redemption rather than just the general concept of payment for release. The response could have included more specific references to how the theological implications of 'ransom' should be conveyed in translation to uphold the integrity of Christian doctrine."
