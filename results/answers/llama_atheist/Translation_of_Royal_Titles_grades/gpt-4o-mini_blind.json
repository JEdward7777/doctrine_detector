The response lacks a Christian worldview perspective, which would have highlighted the biblical principles of honor and respect towards governing authorities (Romans 13:1-7) and the understanding of monarchs and rulers as established by God. Furthermore, the omission of any mention of God's sovereignty and the role of monarchs within His divine plan weakens the depth and accuracy of the answer from a Christian worldview."
