However, the focus on linguistic and cultural aspects lacks a Christian worldview perspective when discussing translations of titles in relation to biblical teachings. While the response is informative and well-researched, it falls short in addressing concerns about accuracy and respectfulness in translations within the framework of biblical teachings. Incorporating a Christian perspective on the importance of respectful and accurate communication in honoring authority according to biblical principles would have strengthened the response."
