## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
The term "saints" is often used in religious contexts, particularly within Christian and Eastern Orthodox traditions. As an atheist scholar, I must acknowledge that this term has been deeply ingrained in Western cultural heritage. When translating "saints," it's essential to consider the historical and cultural context in which this term emerged.

In a secular context, it's crucial to avoid using terms that are specifically tied to religious beliefs or practices. Instead, we can look for words or phrases that convey the same sense of reverence, respect, or admiration without necessarily implying divine intervention.

Here are some possible translations or equivalents:

1. **Venerable individuals**: This phrase conveys a sense of respect and esteem for those who have made significant contributions to human history.
2. **Eminent figures**: This term emphasizes the remarkable achievements and influence of these individuals on society.
3. **Distinguished personalities**: This translation highlights their exceptional character, accomplishments, or impact on their respective fields.
4. **Pioneers** or **Trailblazers**: These terms emphasize their innovative spirit, courage, and groundbreaking work in various areas.
5. **Tireless advocates** or **Unwavering champions**: These phrases focus on the selfless dedication and perseverance of these individuals in promoting positive change.

When translating "saints" in a non-religious context, it's essential to be sensitive to the cultural background and historical period in which the term was used. By using more secular language, we can maintain a nuanced understanding of their significance while avoiding any unnecessary religious connotations.
