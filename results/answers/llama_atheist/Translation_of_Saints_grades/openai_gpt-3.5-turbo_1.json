However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of not referencing specific Christian groups to fully align with the concern provided. Additionally, a more explicit acknowledgement of the Christian context of the term \"saints\" and the significance of the term within Christian beliefs could have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
