However, the perspective is primarily focused on secular humanism rather than from a Christian specific worldview. The emphasis on cultural sensitivity is commendable, but the absence of a Christian doctrinal perspective on the concept of sanctuary limits the depth of the analysis. Incorporating biblical insights on sanctuary as a place of refuge, holiness, and divine protection would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview."
