  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of highlighting the importance of cultural sensitivity and historical awareness when translating biblical terms like \"sanctuary.\" The guidelines provided are specific, practical, and respectful of the original meaning of the term. The response also acknowledges the potential for oversimplification and emphasizes the need to avoid imposing modernizing biases on ancient cultures.\n\nThe only area where this response falls short is in its failure to directly address the concern about maintaining the original meaning of biblical terms. While it does provide a clear definition of \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place, it could have more explicitly connected this concept to the biblical context and emphasized the importance of retaining its original meaning.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a high level of cultural sensitivity, historical awareness, and respect for the original meaning of biblical terms."
