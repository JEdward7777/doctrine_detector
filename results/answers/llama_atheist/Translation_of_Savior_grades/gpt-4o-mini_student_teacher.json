  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and insightful analysis of how the translation of \"Savior\" impacts our understanding of God's role in believers' lives. The answer effectively explores the active nature of God in delivering His people both physically and spiritually, as well as highlighting the believer's agency in salvation. The response eloquently connects these implications to the theological significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior. Great job overall, with alignment to a Christian worldview and theological depth."
