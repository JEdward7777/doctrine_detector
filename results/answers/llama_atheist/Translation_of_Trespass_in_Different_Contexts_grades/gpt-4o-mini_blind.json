  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student presents a thoughtful analysis of the implications of translating \"trespass\" as \"sin\" or \"breaking the rule\" within a church community. They effectively highlight potential pitfalls of such translations and offer alternative perspectives that prioritize understanding, empathy, and healing. This response demonstrates critical thinking and a willingness to challenge common interpretations, aligning with a Christian worldview that values grace, forgiveness, and restoration in interpersonal relationships. Great job overall."
