The mention of the sanctuary of God or temple of God as translations is appropriate. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the doctrinal significance of the phrase within Christian theology, highlighting the Old Testament foreshadowing of Jesus as the ultimate dwelling place of God among His people (John 1:14, 2 Corinthians 6:16). Additionally, a clearer connection to the importance of the Temple in Israelite worship and its relevance to the Christian understanding of God's presence in believers could enhance the response."
