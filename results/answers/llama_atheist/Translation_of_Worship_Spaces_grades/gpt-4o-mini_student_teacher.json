  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful analysis of the cultural and historical context of the phrase \"house of Yahweh\" and offered alternative interpretations. While their answer was insightful and demonstrated an understanding of the complexity of the concept, the reference answer provided a more direct and clear translation that emphasizes the presence of Yahweh in the worship space. The student's response could have been improved by focusing more on ensuring an accurate translation that conveys the importance of worship spaces as highlighted in the concern."
