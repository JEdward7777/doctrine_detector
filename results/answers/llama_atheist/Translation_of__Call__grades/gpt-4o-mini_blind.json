The explanations align well with the significance of names in ancient Near Eastern cultures and how they were tied to identity, lineage, and spirituality. The student demonstrates a good understanding of the context in which the phrase appears in the Bible. One area for improvement could be to explicitly tie the alternative translations to specific biblical passages or instances where naming held particular significance, further strengthening the connection to a Christian worldview."
