  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student has demonstrated a good understanding of the cultural and historical nuances surrounding the phrase \"You must call his name\" in biblical contexts. They provided insightful alternative translations that consider the spiritual and social significance of naming in ancient Near Eastern cultures. However, the student's answer could have been improved by including a translation option similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher, which emphasizes the simple act of naming. This additional translation option would have shown a deeper engagement with the question and a wider range of perspectives on the phrase.\n\nOverall, the student's response shows a solid grasp of biblical language and interpretation, but could have been enhanced with a broader consideration of translation possibilities."
