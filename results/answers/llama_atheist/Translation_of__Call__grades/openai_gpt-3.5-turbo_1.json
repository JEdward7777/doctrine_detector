  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation. The explanation provided contextualizes the importance of naming in ancient Near Eastern cultures and offers thoughtful alternative translations that align with a Christian worldview. The response could be enhanced by further examination of the theological implications of naming within biblical narratives, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern raised."
