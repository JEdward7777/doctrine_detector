  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed comparison between older and modern English Bible translations regarding the translation of 'elect.' They also discussed the implications of these translation choices on understanding the concept of being chosen by God. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more specifically on the impact of the translation differences on Scripture interpretation related to the concept of being chosen by God. Additionally, the atheistic perspective introduced in the response is not relevant to the provided answer and concerns, as it detracts from a Christian-specific worldview."
