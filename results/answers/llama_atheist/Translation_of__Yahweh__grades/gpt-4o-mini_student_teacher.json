  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough historical and cultural context surrounding the preference for using 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh' in translations. However, the response lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not address the concern raised about the importance of using original names of God versus cultural practices within a Christian context. The student's answer would benefit from incorporating scriptural and theological perspectives to align more closely with a Christian worldview."
