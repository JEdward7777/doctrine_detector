The explanation is well-researched and provides valuable insights into the context of this translation choice. However, from a Christian worldview, the response falls short in addressing the concern about the importance of using the original names of God versus cultural practices. It does not address how honoring the original names of God aligns with Christian beliefs about the sacredness and significance of God's name. A stronger connection to Christian theological perspectives on the divine name and its importance in worship and reverence would have enhanced the response."
