  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of various translation suggestions for the term 'beloved' based on linguistic and cultural perspectives, but failed to address the concern of ensuring accurate interpretation of biblical texts and enhancing interpersonal relationships within the Christian faith. The response lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not engage with the given concern. Additionally, the emphasis on atheism and the exclusion of divine inspiration may not resonate well with a Christian audience seeking a biblical perspective on translation."
