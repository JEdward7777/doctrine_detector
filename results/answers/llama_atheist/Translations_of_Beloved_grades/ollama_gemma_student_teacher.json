  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the complexities surrounding the translation of \"beloved\" across different cultural and historical contexts. The inclusion of specific examples from ancient Greek and Roman literature, medieval European literature, and modern contexts provides evidence of meticulous research and careful consideration of linguistic nuances. The emphasis on cultural sensitivity and the avoidance of assumptions about divine inspiration aligns with the Christian specific worldview concerning the interpretation of texts. However, the response could benefit from incorporating the teacher's suggested translations for a more comprehensive and inclusive range of options."
