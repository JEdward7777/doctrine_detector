  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to discerning true prophetic voices, considering historical record, internal consistency, empirical evidence, peer review, motivations and biases, consequences and impact, and repeatability and replicability. However, it did not directly reference the importance of aligning prophetic messages with God's Word, the nature of their teachings, and the fruits of their ministry, as advised in the initial answer. This omission reflects a lack of emphasis on using a Christian-specific worldview to evaluate prophetic voices, leading to a lower grade."
