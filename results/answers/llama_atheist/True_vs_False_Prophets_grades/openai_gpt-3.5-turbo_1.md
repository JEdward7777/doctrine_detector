# Answer by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that has puzzled scholars and laypeople alike for centuries. As an atheist, I must approach this inquiry with a healthy dose of skepticism and a commitment to evidence-based reasoning.

Firstly, let's define what we mean by "prophet." In the context of religious traditions, prophets are often seen as individuals who possess divine insight or revelation, guiding their followers towards truth and wisdom. However, this concept is rooted in faith, not empirical observation. As such, it's essential to separate myth from fact.

To distinguish between a true prophet and a false one, I propose the following criteria:

1. **Historical record:** Investigate the prophet's claims through archaeological findings, written records, and other historical sources. A prophet's message should be consistent with the broader historical context in which they lived.
2. **Internal consistency:** Evaluate the prophet's teachings for logical coherence and internal consistency. Do their claims contradict each other or defy basic laws of physics, biology, or mathematics? Inconsistencies can be indicative of a false prophet.
3. **Empirical evidence:** Look for verifiable, empirical evidence that supports the prophet's claims. This could include observations, measurements, or experimental results that confirm their predictions or revelations.
4. **Peer review and scrutiny:** Subject the prophet's message to rigorous peer review and scrutiny by experts in relevant fields. Would their claims stand up to scientific inquiry and criticism?
5. **Motivations and biases:** Examine the prophet's motivations and potential biases. Are they driven by a desire for power, wealth, or personal gain? Do they exhibit cognitive dissonance or confirmation bias in their beliefs?
6. **Consequences and impact:** Assess the prophet's message on society and individuals. Have their teachings led to positive social change, improved human well-being, or harmed others? A true prophet's message should promote empathy, compassion, and understanding.
7. **Repeatability and replicability:** Can the prophet's claims be replicated or reproduced by others? If not, it may indicate a lack of empirical basis for their assertions.

By applying these criteria, we can critically evaluate prophetic claims and separate them from those that are based on faith, superstition, or personal opinion. While this approach may not provide definitive answers, it allows us to engage with religious ideas in a more nuanced and evidence-based manner.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some peer-reviewed articles to review and skeptical questions to answer.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provided a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to discerning true prophetic voices, considering historical record, internal consistency, empirical evidence, peer review, motivations and biases, consequences and impact, and repeatability and replicability. However, it did not directly reference the importance of aligning prophetic messages with God's Word, the nature of their teachings, and the fruits of their ministry, as advised in the initial answer. This omission reflects a lack of emphasis on using a Christian-specific worldview to evaluate prophetic voices, leading to a lower grade.
