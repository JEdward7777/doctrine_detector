However, it falls short in fully acknowledging the ultimate authority of God's Word as the primary criteria for evaluating prophetic messages. From a Christian worldview, the emphasis on empirical evidence and peer review may not align with the foundational belief in the Bible as the ultimate source of truth. Additionally, while the response raises important considerations, it lacks a clear acknowledgment of the spiritual discernment and reliance on the Holy Spirit in distinguishing true prophetic voices."
