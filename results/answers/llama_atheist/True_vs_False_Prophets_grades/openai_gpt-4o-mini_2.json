  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response shows a thoughtful and analytical approach to evaluating prophetic claims, considering historical record, internal consistency, empirical evidence, peer review, motivations, impact, and repeatability. However, it lacks a specific focus on aligning the messages with God's Word, the nature of teachings, and the fruits of ministry, which are crucial from a Christian worldview perspective. The response could benefit from incorporating more emphasis on these Christian-specific criteria for discerning true prophetic voices."
