  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-thought-out response that effectively distinguishes between hope and mere wishing in the context of having hope in God. They have correctly identified the difference as being grounded in trust and reliance on divine intervention versus merely expressing personal desire. However, the response could have been strengthened by more explicitly emphasizing the element of confident trust in God's faithfulness, as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the core distinction between hope and wishful thinking within a Christian worldview."
