  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation grounded in historical and cultural context, they fail to directly address the concern of encouraging followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability. The answer offers valuable insights into biblical principles related to trustworthiness but lacks a clear emphasis on how these principles should be actively applied and encouraged within a Christian worldview. The response does well in providing a general understanding of trustworthiness according to biblical principles, but could be strengthened by highlighting the importance of guiding others to uphold these values in their own actions."
