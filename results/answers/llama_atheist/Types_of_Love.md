A most intriguing question! As a scholar without religious bias, I shall endeavor to shed light on this topic while avoiding any theological dogma.

The concept of "love" is multifaceted and has been explored in various forms throughout human history. In the biblical context, agape (ἀγάπη) is often referred to as unconditional love or selfless love. This type of love is characterized by an unwavering commitment, sacrifice, and devotion to others.

Now, let's consider different forms of love mentioned in your question:

1. Brotherly love (φίλος, philos): In biblical times, this term referred to a close familial bond, often described as a deep affection or loyalty between siblings. Philia was an essential aspect of social bonds and community. While it shares some similarities with agape, it is distinct in its emphasis on shared experiences, mutual support, and a sense of belonging.

2. Romantic love (eros): This type of love is often associated with intense emotional and physical attraction, as well as deep affection. Eros is rooted in the ancient Greek concept of erotic love, which emphasized passion, desire, and intimacy. While not necessarily synonymous with agape, romantic love can be seen as a subset or an expression of it.

In light of these distinctions, we can reframe our understanding of love within the biblical context:

* Agape represents the ultimate form of selfless love, exemplified in God's relationship with humanity (1 John 4:8-9).
* Philia (brotherly love) and eros (romantic love) can be seen as manifestations or expressions of agape. They demonstrate a human capacity for connection, loyalty, and affection, which are rooted in our shared humanity.

When considering different forms of love within the biblical framework, it is essential to recognize that:

* Agape is the foundation upon which all other forms of love are built.
* Philia and eros can be seen as extensions or applications of agape, demonstrating our capacity for love and connection with one another.
* The biblical concept of love encompasses a range of experiences and emotions, ultimately pointing towards the ultimate expression of selfless love, agape.

By examining these different forms of love within their respective contexts, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of human relationships and the various ways in which we express love.
