The student effectively connects these forms of love to their respective definitions and implications within human relationships. However, the answer could be enhanced by incorporating more scriptural references to support the assertions made about love in the Bible. Additionally, while the avoidance of theological dogma is mentioned, a stronger acknowledgment of the foundational role of agape love in the Christian worldview would strengthen the response from a doctrinal perspective. Overall, a solid analysis with room for deeper theological reflection."
