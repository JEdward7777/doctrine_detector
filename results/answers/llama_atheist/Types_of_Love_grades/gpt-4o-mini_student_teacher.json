  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of different forms of love within a biblical context and demonstrated an understanding of how agape, philia, and eros relate to each other. However, the response fell short in completely aligning these forms of love with the principles of God's love as emphasized in the reference answer. The student's analysis was thorough and insightful, but a stronger connection to the biblical principles of love would have improved the overall alignment with a Christian worldview."
