However, from a Christian worldview, the response falls short in acknowledging the biblical understanding of the Antichrist as a real spiritual entity who will arise in the end times. The student should have referenced key biblical passages, such as Revelation 13 and 1 John 2, while explaining the concept of the Antichrist. Additionally, the student's perspective as an atheist should not have influenced the approach to answering the question from a Christian-specific worldview."
