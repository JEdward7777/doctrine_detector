However, it lacks a Christian worldview perspective on the ultimate defeat of the Antichrist by Jesus and the significance of this understanding for Christians in facing challenges to their faith. In considering eschatological figures, Christians are encouraged to rely on God's sovereignty and ultimate victory over evil, which was not emphasized in this response."
