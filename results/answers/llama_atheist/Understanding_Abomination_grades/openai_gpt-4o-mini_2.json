From a Christian perspective, it is essential not only to identify actions against God's will as outlined in Scripture but also to recognize the overarching theme of repentance, redemption, and forgiveness through Jesus Christ for those who commit such sins. The response does not acknowledge the Christian understanding of sin and the need for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ."
