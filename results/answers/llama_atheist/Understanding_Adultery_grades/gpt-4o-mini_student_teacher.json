  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of what the Bible says about the consequences of adultery, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. However, they failed to address the concern of evaluating the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality from a Christian worldview. The student also included a statement identifying as an atheist scholar, which may not align well with a Christian-specific worldview. The response lacked a clear connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher, and the concluding remarks on personal beliefs and values detract from a Christian perspective on the topic."
