  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical perspective on the consequences of committing adultery. They provide detailed analysis of relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the physical, emotional, and spiritual implications of this act. Additionally, the student acknowledges the cultural context in which these passages were written and offers insights into their applicability in modern times. However, the student's athiest perspective and emphasis on understanding historical and cultural contexts detract slightly from the explicitly Christian worldview specified in the grading criteria."
