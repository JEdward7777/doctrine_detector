  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the biblical perspective on adultery, highlighting its significance as a sin that breaks the covenant between husband and wife, leading to spiritual and relational consequences. The inclusion of key biblical references and the exploration of both Old and New Testament teachings strengthen the analysis. However, deducting a few points for failing to address the specific Bible verses provided in the answer and for slightly deviating from the central focus on the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality. Overall, a well-reasoned and informative response from a Christian worldview."
