However, the answer falls short in a Christian worldview due to the inclusion of atheistic perspectives and the absence of emphasizing the foundational role of faith in Jesus Christ for receiving eternal life. The neutral and culturally retributive approach detracts from the doctrinal correctness needed in a Christian analysis. It is important to prioritize the clarity of Christian doctrines over presenting contrasting viewpoints."
