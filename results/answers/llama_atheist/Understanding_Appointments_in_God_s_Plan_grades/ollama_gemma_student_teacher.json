  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" within a Christian context. They provide a comprehensive analysis of relevant scriptures and clearly articulate the idea that salvation is a gift from God, not based on human merit. The inclusion of a secular perspective adds depth to the discussion and highlights the tension between free will and determinism. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful response."
