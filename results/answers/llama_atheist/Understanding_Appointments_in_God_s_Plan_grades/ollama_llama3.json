It also acknowledges the importance of this concept in Christian doctrine and its historical debates.\n\nWhile the response is generally accurate and well-supported, it could be improved by more explicitly addressing the concern about divine selection and grace in salvation. The answer provided does touch on these themes, but a more direct engagement with the concern would strengthen the overall response. Additionally, the transition from the Christian context to the secular context (the \"more secular context\" section) feels slightly abrupt and could be smoother.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and its place in Christian theology."
