A question that gets to the heart of Christian theology! As an atheist scholar, I'll do my best to provide a neutral and culturally retributive analysis.

In a Christian context, being "appointed to eternal life" refers to the idea that God has predetermined or chosen individuals for salvation through Jesus Christ. This concept is rooted in passages like Romans 8:29-30, which says:

"For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son... And those whom he predestined he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified."

In this context, "appointed" (or "predestined") implies that God has chosen certain individuals for salvation before the foundation of the world. This choice is not based on human merit or works but rather on God's sovereign will.

The phrase "eternal life" typically refers to a state of existence beyond physical death, where those appointed to eternal life will experience fellowship with God and enjoy an unbroken relationship with Him.

From a Christian perspective, this concept of being "appointed to eternal life" is central to their understanding of salvation. It emphasizes the idea that salvation is not earned through human effort but rather is a gift from God, graciously bestowed upon those He has chosen.

In a more secular context, the idea of predestination can be seen as a reflection of the inherent tension between free will and determinism. While it may seem paradoxical to modern Western sensibilities, the concept of being "appointed to eternal life" highlights the mystery and sovereignty of God in Christian theology.

It's essential to acknowledge that this concept is deeply rooted in Christian doctrine and has been debated throughout Christian history. I hope this analysis provides a culturally retributive understanding of the term, even if it doesn't necessarily align with my own atheistic views!
