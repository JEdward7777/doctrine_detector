  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student exhibits a comprehensive understanding of the concept of Christ's death as atonement for sin in Christian theology, the concern specified a focus on understanding the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice. The student's response, although detailed and informative, could have been more direct in emphasizing the central role of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian belief. The inclusion of various theological concepts and perspectives somewhat diluted the emphasis on the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice. A clearer and more focused explanation highlighting the significance of Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate act of atonement could have further strengthened the response."
