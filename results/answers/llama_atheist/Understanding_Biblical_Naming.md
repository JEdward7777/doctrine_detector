## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
When we read "His name is called John" in the Bible, it's essential to understand the cultural and linguistic context of ancient Near Eastern naming practices.

In biblical times, names were not merely labels or identifiers; they often carried significance and meaning. A person's name was believed to reflect their character, fate, or destiny. This is why we see a prevalence of names with prophetic or priestly connotations in the Hebrew Bible.

When "His name is called John," it's likely an allusion to the common Semitic practice of naming a person based on a characteristic, event, or circumstance surrounding their birth or early life. In this case, the name "John" (Hebrew: יוחנן, Yochanan) means "God is gracious" or "God has shown favor."

The phrase "His name is called John" may suggest that the individual being named was born during a time of great need or crisis, and his parents were expressing gratitude to God for intervening on their behalf. This would have been seen as a sign of divine favor, and the name would serve as a reminder of God's graciousness in the face of adversity.

In this context, naming someone "John" was not merely a matter of personal preference but rather an acknowledgment of God's involvement in their life from the very beginning. It's possible that the person being named John was seen as having a special role or purpose to fulfill, and the name served as a reminder of their divine calling.

By understanding the cultural significance of naming practices in ancient Israel, we can better appreciate the rich symbolism and meaning behind names like "John" in the biblical narrative.
