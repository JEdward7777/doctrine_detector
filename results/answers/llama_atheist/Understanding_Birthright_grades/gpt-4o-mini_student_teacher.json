  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a detailed analysis of the story of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob from a secular perspective, they miss the spiritual significance highlighted in the biblical text. The student focuses solely on the cultural and human aspects of the story without considering the spiritual consequences of Esau's decision. A Christian worldview would emphasize the importance of honoring God's design for family relationships and the spiritual implications of Esau's choice to prioritize immediate gratification over God's blessing."
