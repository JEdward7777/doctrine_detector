  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the biblical concept of being blameless before God. They effectively analyze relevant passages from the Hebrew Bible and apply them to the Christian worldview. The student also acknowledges the distinction between being blameless and being sinless, and explains that being blameless requires a level of moral perfection that is impossible for humans to achieve on their own. The inclusion of an atheistic perspective adds depth to the analysis and demonstrates the student's ability to consider alternative viewpoints."
