However, the analysis lacks a Christian worldview perspective and does not acknowledge the sacredness and seriousness of blasphemy as understood within Christian doctrine. The student's approach of maintaining neutrality and distancing themselves from endorsing religious beliefs may limit the depth of understanding required in approaching this topic from a Christian specific worldview. More emphasis on the spiritual and eternal consequences of blasphemy in accordance with Christian teachings would have strengthened the response."
