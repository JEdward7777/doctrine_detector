  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45/100\n\nComments: The response provides a good overview of the biblical concepts of \"clean\" and \"unclean\" in relation to ritual purity and temple practices. However, the answer falls short in acknowledging the deeper theological implications and spiritual significance of these concepts within a Christian worldview. The student correctly recognizes that the distinction is not primarily about moral character but neglects to emphasize the overarching message of holiness and the separation from sin that these concepts point towards. Additionally, the student's interpretation of how these concepts may be misapplied in modern contexts lacks a Christian perspective on the enduring moral principles underlying these distinctions. A more robust engagement with the biblical basis of moral purity and how it extends beyond ritual practices would have improved the response."
