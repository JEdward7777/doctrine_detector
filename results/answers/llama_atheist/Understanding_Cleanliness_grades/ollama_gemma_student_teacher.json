They provide a nuanced analysis, highlighting the primary concern of preserving ritual purity rather than moral judgment. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from acknowledging the broader implications of these concepts in shaping moral behavior. While the student correctly points out the misapplication of these concepts in modern contexts like racial segregation, they could further explore how the biblical definitions might inform believers' personal and communal lives beyond ritual purity."
