From a Christian worldview, cleanliness in a spiritual context is not merely a ritual practice but reflects a deeper importance on moral purity and separation from sin. The response fails to acknowledge the spiritual guidance and significance that understanding the concept of cleanliness holds for believers in their personal and communal lives, which is crucial in upholding Christian values and principles."
