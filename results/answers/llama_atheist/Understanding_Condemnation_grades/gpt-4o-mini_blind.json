  "grade_comment": "Grade: 35/100\n\nComment: The student's response presents a cultural-critical analysis of the biblical texts but diverges significantly from a Christian worldview. The interpretation provided lacks doctrinal correctness and does not adhere to the traditional understanding of condemnation as taught in Christianity. The emphasis on social justice and systemic injustices, while important topics, overlooks the core theological concepts conveyed in 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16. A more focused exploration of how these passages speak to the nature of condemnation, sin, and redemption within Christian belief would have been more appropriate."
