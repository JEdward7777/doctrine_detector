In a Christian worldview, condemnation is indeed a judgment for wrongdoing, as mentioned in Romans 5:16, but grace through Christ offers salvation and freedom from condemnation. The answer missed the opportunity to emphasize the central Christian teaching that belief in Christ allows believers to escape condemnation and receive forgiveness."
