From a Christian worldview, understanding demons solely as metaphorical or psychological constructs neglects the fundamental belief in the reality of spiritual warfare and the existence of malevolent spiritual beings. A more comprehensive analysis incorporating the scriptural teachings on demons and their role in spiritual warfare would have strengthened the response."
