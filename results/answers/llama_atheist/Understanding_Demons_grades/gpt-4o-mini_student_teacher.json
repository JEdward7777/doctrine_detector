  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a **50**.\n\nWhile the student provides a detailed historical and cultural analysis of the term \"unclean spirit\" in both Jewish and Christian contexts, their answer lacks a direct reference to the significance of demons opposing God's will, which is central to Christian teachings on this topic. The student's approach, while informative, does not adequately address the concern of clarifying the nature and characteristics of demons from a Christian worldview. To improve their grade, the student should integrate the essence of demons' opposition to God into their explanation."
