  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the term \"unclean spirit\" in Christian teachings. The response effectively draws on historical and cultural context to explain the origins and significance of the term in early Christian literature. It clearly articulates the connection between the concept of uncleanliness in Jewish tradition and the metaphorical use of \"unclean spirit\" in Christian texts. The inclusion of relevant textual examples from Mark 1:23-26 reinforces the student's argument."
