However, the response could have strengthened its alignment with a Christian worldview by explicitly stating that these unclean spirits are manifestations of demonic entities in opposition to God's will. Additionally, more emphasis could have been placed on the influence of demons on individuals and the spiritual warfare aspect inherent in dealing with unclean spirits from a Christian perspective."
