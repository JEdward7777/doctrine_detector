It effectively clarifies the nature and characteristics of demons and their influence on individuals through the lens of Jewish and Graeco-Roman backgrounds. However, it falls short of directly addressing the Christian-specific concern of the demonic entities' opposition to God's will and the need for redemption, which is a key aspect from a Christian worldview."
