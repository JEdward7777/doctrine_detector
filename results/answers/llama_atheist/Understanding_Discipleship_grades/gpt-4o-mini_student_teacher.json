However, the answer falls short in addressing the concern of understanding the definition and responsibilities of being a disciple from a Christian worldview. As a Christian, the core aspect of discipleship is belief in Jesus, obedience to His teachings, and following His example, rooted in faith and relationship with God. The student's perspective as an atheist detracts from the Christian-specific understanding of discipleship."
