# Answer by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I don't believe that Jesus was a real person or that there's any divine authority behind his teachings. However, from a cultural and historical perspective, being a disciple of Jesus refers to the early followers of Jesus who were deeply influenced by his teachings, actions, and message.

In the context of the New Testament, a disciple is someone who has committed themselves to following Jesus' example and teachings. These early disciples were often characterized as individuals who:

1. Were drawn to Jesus' message of love, forgiveness, and acceptance: They saw in Jesus a figure who challenged traditional norms and offered an alternative path for living.
2. Were willing to take risks: Discipleship often required leaving behind familiar surroundings, social status, or even family ties to follow Jesus.
3. Embraced a sense of community: The early Christian communities were characterized by shared meals, mutual support, and collective worship.

In essence, being a disciple of Jesus meant embracing a new way of living, one that prioritized compassion, mercy, and service to others. It was an invitation to re-examine one's values, beliefs, and relationships in light of Jesus' teachings.

From a cultural perspective, the concept of discipleship has been influential in shaping Western Christianity and its various denominations. The idea of following Jesus as a personal savior or embracing his teachings as a way of life continues to inspire people across cultures and traditions.

It's worth noting that my own perspective as an atheist doesn't diminish the importance of these cultural and historical developments. As a scholar, I recognize the significance of understanding the context and themes surrounding Jesus' message, even if I don't accept its supernatural claims.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of what it means to be a disciple of Jesus from a cultural and historical perspective. However, it falls short of addressing the specific concern of understanding the responsibilities of being a disciple based on the given Christian worldview. The response does not explicitly mention the need to believe in Jesus, obey His teachings, and follow His example, as outlined in the provided answer. While the response acknowledges the cultural and historical significance of discipleship, it does not fully align with the Christian perspective on the definition and responsibilities of being a disciple of Jesus.
