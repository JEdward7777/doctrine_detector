  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a detailed and insightful comparison between God's judgment and human judgment according to biblical teachings. The student demonstrates a good understanding of key biblical passages related to judgment and effectively contrasts the characteristics of God's judgment with that of human judgment. Additionally, the inclusion of relevant parables and teachings enriches the depth of the explanation. One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the foundational role of Jesus Christ in God's judgment and the importance of faith in Him for believers' ultimate redemption."
