## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I don't have personal beliefs or convictions about the Bible or its teachings. However, as a scholar, I can provide you with an objective analysis of what the Bible teaches about inheriting eternal life.

According to Christian theology, the concept of inheriting eternal life is rooted in the idea that humans are created by God and are meant to have a personal relationship with Him. The Bible teaches that due to humanity's sinfulness (as described in Genesis 3), we are separated from God and are destined for spiritual death (Romans 6:23). However, through Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross, it is possible for humans to be reconciled to God and receive eternal life.

The Bible teaches that eternal life is not just a future reward, but also a present reality. Those who put their faith in Jesus Christ are said to have already received eternal life (John 3:36, 1 John 5:12). This eternal life is described as being with God, enjoying His presence, and experiencing the fullness of life that He intended for us from the beginning.

The concept of inheriting eternal life is closely tied to the idea of salvation. In Christian theology, salvation is often understood as a process by which believers are justified (declared righteous) through faith in Jesus Christ, and then sanctified (made holy) through the work of the Holy Spirit. The ultimate goal of this salvation is to receive eternal life with God.

The Bible also teaches that inheriting eternal life requires a personal decision to follow Jesus Christ and accept His gift of salvation. This decision is often described as "accepting" or "believing" in Jesus, which involves acknowledging one's sinfulness, turning away from sin (repentance), and committing oneself to following Jesus.

It's important to note that the Bible teaches that inheriting eternal life is not just a matter of intellectual assent or moral effort, but rather a result of having a personal relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ.
