However, the initial answer, suggesting that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws alone, does not align with the Christian worldview as outlined in the Bible. The concern about the importance of understanding how to attain eternal life for spiritual assurance was effectively addressed in the response with a clear explanation of the process of inheriting eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ."
