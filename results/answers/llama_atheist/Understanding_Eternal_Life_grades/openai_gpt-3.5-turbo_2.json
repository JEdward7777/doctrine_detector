However, the response falls short in aligning with a Christian worldview as it states that eternal life can be inherited solely by obeying God's laws and having faith in Him, which neglects the central role of Jesus Christ's sacrifice and redemption in Christian theology. A Christian perspective would emphasize that eternal life is received through faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Savior."
