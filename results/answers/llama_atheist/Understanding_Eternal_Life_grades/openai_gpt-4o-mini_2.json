However, the initial statement by the student that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws lacks alignment with Christian theology, as the Bible teaches that eternal life is primarily attained through faith in Jesus Christ rather than mere obedience to laws. The response could have emphasized the centrality of faith in Jesus Christ and the grace of God as the key factors in inheriting eternal life in line with Christian beliefs."
