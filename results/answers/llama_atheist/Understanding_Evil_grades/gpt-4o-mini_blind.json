However, it falls short in its dismissive approach by explicitly stating atheistic neutrality and avoiding any theological insights that would be crucial to fully understanding the biblical distinctions. In a Christian worldview, approaching the Bible solely as a cultural or literary text without acknowledging its theological foundation is a significant oversight. Additionally, the student's emphasis on cultural analysis over theological truth does not align with a Christian worldview that values doctrinal correctness and the acknowledgment of the Bible as the Word of God."
