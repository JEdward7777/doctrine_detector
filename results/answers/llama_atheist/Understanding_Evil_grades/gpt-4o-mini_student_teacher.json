  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student's answer, while well-researched and informative, missed the mark by approaching the question from a neutral, atheistic perspective rather than engaging with the specified concern of ensuring clarity on the moral implications of behaviors and character in the context of biblical teachings. The student's answer lacked the Christian worldview lens necessary to fully understand the distinction between 'evil' and 'wickedness' as described in the Bible. The response also failed to emphasize the importance of these distinctions for moral reflection and spiritual growth. Additionally, the attempt to remain religiously neutral detracted from the depth of analysis required in a Christian-specific worldview assessment."
