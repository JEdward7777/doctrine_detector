The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of how these terms relate to behaviors and character in the Bible. However, the use of an atheistic perspective and the avoidance of explicitly acknowledging the moral implications of these concepts within a Christian worldview detracts from the overall clarity and depth of the analysis. An integration of Christian beliefs and teachings would have enhanced the response and provided a more robust perspective."
