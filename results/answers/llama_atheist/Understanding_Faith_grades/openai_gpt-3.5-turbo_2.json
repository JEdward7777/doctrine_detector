However, the response is limited in its Christian worldview perspective due to the explicit denial of Jesus' supernatural or divine nature from an atheistic standpoint. While the secular perspective on faith in Jesus is explored, the lack of acknowledgement or acceptance of Jesus' divinity is a significant deviation from a Christian worldview."
