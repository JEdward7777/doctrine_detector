They show a good understanding of the historical and cultural influences on the concept of fear. However, the answer lacks a clear connection to the concern given, which emphasized deepening one's relationship with God and enhancing worship practices. The student's perspective as an atheist may also color their interpretation and understanding of biblical fear. Incorporating more analysis on how understanding biblical fear can impact one's relationship with God and worship practices would have strengthened the response."
