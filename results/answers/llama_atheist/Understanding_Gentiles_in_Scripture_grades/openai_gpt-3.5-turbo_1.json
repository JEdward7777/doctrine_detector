The answer does not acknowledge the transformative work of Jesus Christ in breaking down barriers between Jews and Gentiles in the early church, which is crucial from a Christian perspective. A more substantial integration of Christian theology and the redemptive work of Christ would have strengthened the response in addressing the concern raised."
