The analysis effectively addresses the concern by discussing how the Israelites' perception of Gentiles influenced the dynamics within the early church. However, the response lacks a Christian worldview perspective and dismisses any theological implications by approaching the topic from an atheistic viewpoint. Integrating insights from a Christian worldview, such as the universal scope of salvation through Jesus Christ and the importance of unity in the body of believers, would have strengthened the analysis."
