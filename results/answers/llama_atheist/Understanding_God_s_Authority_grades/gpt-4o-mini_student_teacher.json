  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and informative response from a cultural and historical perspective. However, the answer did not directly address the significance of God's authority in believers' personal lives, as stated in the concern. Additionally, the Christian worldview emphasizes the personal relationship believers have with God and the implications of His sovereignty in their daily lives, which was not adequately addressed in the student's response."
