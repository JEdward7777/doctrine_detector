  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the biblical passage, exploring the cultural and historical contexts of the phrase \"God has called us by name.\" The student correctly identifies the significance of names in ancient Near Eastern cultures and suggests possible metaphorical interpretations of the phrase. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview and the specific understanding of God's calling in Scripture."
