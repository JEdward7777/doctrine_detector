However, it strays away from the Christian specific worldview by avoiding the acknowledgment of God's divine intervention and personal relationship with individuals. While it presents a well-reasoned analysis, it falls short in addressing the deeper Christian understanding of God's personal calling and intention towards individuals as expressed in the biblical phrase."
