The response focuses more on metaphorical and cultural interpretations rather than discussing the personal relationship and intention God has towards individuals as outlined in the original answer and concern. A stronger connection to the Christian worldview, emphasizing God's personal knowledge of individuals and His specific purpose for them, would have enhanced the response."
