  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed analysis of the concept of being called by God from a historical, cultural, and theological perspective. However, the student fails to directly address the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith. The reference answer succinctly captures the essence of being called by God, which is missing in the student's response. Additionally, the student's analysis lacks a clear focus on the personal aspect of God's calling and how it relates to an individual's sense of purpose within their faith. It is crucial to emphasize the personal dimension of being called by God in order to fully address the concern raised."
