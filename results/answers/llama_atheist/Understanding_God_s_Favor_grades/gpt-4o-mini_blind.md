## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Favor.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
An excellent question!

According to the Bible, Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and humans through his obedience to God's will, his teachings on love and compassion, and his sacrificial act of self-giving. Here are some key examples:

**Favor with God:**

1. **Obedience**: Jesus was obedient to God's will throughout his life, including when he prayed in the garden before being arrested (Matthew 26:39-44).
2. **Trust in God's sovereignty**: Jesus demonstrated trust in God's sovereignty by surrendering himself to be crucified despite knowing the outcome (John 10:18; Philippians 2:8).
3. **Perfect sacrifice**: Jesus offered a perfect and sinless sacrifice, once for all time, to reconcile humanity with God (Hebrews 7:26-28; 9:23-28).

**Favor with men:**

1. **Teachings on love and compassion**: Jesus taught about the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself (Mark 12:29-31) and showed compassion to those considered outcasts, such as lepers and women (Matthew 8:2-3; Mark 5:21-24).
2. **Inclusive relationships**: Jesus associated with people from all walks of life, including tax collectors, sinners, and the marginalized (Luke 15:1-32; Matthew 9:10-13).
3. **Self-giving love**: Jesus demonstrated his love for humanity by giving himself up on the cross, showing that God is a God of love who desires to reconcile with humanity (John 3:16-17).

In summary, Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and men through his obedience, trust in God's sovereignty, perfect sacrifice, teachings on love and compassion, inclusive relationships, and self-giving love. These actions reflect the essence of Jesus' message and serve as a model for us to follow in our own relationships with God and humanity.

Comment: The response provides an in-depth analysis of how Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men according to the Bible. It accurately identifies key aspects such as Jesus' obedience, trust in God's sovereignty, sacrificial act, teachings on love and compassion, inclusive relationships, and self-giving love. The references to relevant Bible verses support the points made. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the student could have emphasized more on Jesus' unique role as the Son of God and Savior of the world through his sacrificial death and resurrection for the redemption of humanity. Additionally, a stronger connection to the concept of grace and undeserved favor in Jesus' favor with both God and men could have been beneficial.
