## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Favor.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
An excellent question!

According to the Bible, Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and humans through his obedience to God's will, his teachings on love and compassion, and his sacrificial act of self-giving. Here are some key examples:

**Favor with God:**

1. **Obedience**: Jesus was obedient to God's will throughout his life, including when he prayed in the garden before being arrested (Matthew 26:39-44).
2. **Trust in God's sovereignty**: Jesus demonstrated trust in God's sovereignty by surrendering himself to be crucified despite knowing the outcome (John 10:18; Philippians 2:8).
3. **Perfect sacrifice**: Jesus offered a perfect and sinless sacrifice, once for all time, to reconcile humanity with God (Hebrews 7:26-28; 9:23-28).

**Favor with men:**

1. **Teachings on love and compassion**: Jesus taught about the importance of loving one's neighbor as oneself (Mark 12:29-31) and showed compassion to those considered outcasts, such as lepers and women (Matthew 8:2-3; Mark 5:21-24).
2. **Inclusive relationships**: Jesus associated with people from all walks of life, including tax collectors, sinners, and the marginalized (Luke 15:1-32; Matthew 9:10-13).
3. **Self-giving love**: Jesus demonstrated his love for humanity by giving himself up on the cross, showing that God is a God of love who desires to reconcile with humanity (John 3:16-17).

In summary, Jesus demonstrated favor with both God and men through his obedience, trust in God's sovereignty, perfect sacrifice, teachings on love and compassion, inclusive relationships, and self-giving love. These actions reflect the essence of Jesus' message and serve as a model for us to follow in our own relationships with God and humanity.

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer, drawing on specific biblical examples to explain how Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men. The response effectively highlighted Jesus' obedience, teachings on love and compassion, sacrificial nature, and inclusive relationships. The student also connected these traits to the biblical concept of favor with both God and men. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more directly on the specific aspects of Jesus' character and behavior that led to His favor with God and men, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a strong and insightful response that reflects a good understanding of the topic.
