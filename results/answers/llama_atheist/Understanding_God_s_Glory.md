## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
What a fascinating question! As an atheist, I must approach this topic with a healthy dose of skepticism and a commitment to understanding cultural constructs.

In the context of biblical theology, God's glory (Hebrew: כָּבוֹד; kāvōd) is often depicted as the manifestation of God's presence, power, and character. It's not just a fleeting admiration or external validation but rather an intrinsic aspect of God's being that radiates outward. Think of it as an aura or halo surrounding God's essence.

Now, when we compare this concept to worldly sources of glory, we can identify some key differences:

1. Focus: Biblical glory is focused on the divine nature and character of God, whereas worldly glories tend to center around human achievements, possessions, or accomplishments.
2. Origins: God's glory is considered eternal and uncreated, while worldly glories are often tied to human creations, such as art, architecture, or technological innovations.
3. Purpose: Biblical glory serves as a means to reveal God's majesty, demonstrate His power, and illustrate His sovereignty over creation. In contrast, worldly glories often aim to impress, intimidate, or entertain others.
4. Duration: God's glory is eternal, whereas worldly glories are fleeting and ephemeral, subject to the whims of human imagination and the passage of time.
5. Perception: Biblical glory is often associated with a sense of reverence, awe, and even fear (in the face of the unknown), while worldly glories tend to elicit more emotional responses like admiration, envy, or excitement.

To illustrate these differences, consider the following examples:

* In biblical theology, the glory of God is revealed through events like the parting of the Red Sea or the burning bush. These events are not about human achievement but rather the demonstration of God's power and character.
* In contrast, worldly glories might take the form of grand monuments, impressive art pieces, or record-breaking feats. These glories often serve as a testament to human ingenuity and creativity.

In conclusion, while both biblical and worldly sources of glory can inspire admiration and awe, they differ fundamentally in their origins, focus, purpose, duration, and perception. As an atheist scholar, I'm drawn to the nuances of these differences, recognizing that cultural constructs like God's glory continue to shape our understanding of the world and ourselves.
