The answer provided does not acknowledge the Christian understanding of God as the Creator, Sustainer, and ultimate source of all glory. It also lacks recognition of how God's glory is intrinsically tied to His holiness, righteousness, and sovereignty. From a Christian perspective, comparing God's glory to worldly sources of glory must emphasize the vast difference between the infinite, uncreated glory of God and the finite, man-made glories of the world. It is important to address the significance of God's glory as the highest and most ultimate form of glory in all aspects."
