  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response, while well-written and thoughtful, misses the mark on the Christian perspective of seeking God's will. As an atheist, the student's viewpoint on this topic is expected; however, from a Christian worldview, seeking God's will goes beyond personal values and principles. It involves submission to God's authority, prayer for guidance, studying and obeying His Word (the Bible), and aligning one's desires with His purpose and plans. The omission of these crucial elements leads to a low grade in terms of doctrinal correctness."
