The answer provided focuses more on secular or philosophical perspectives on seeking guidance rather than on seeking God's will specifically. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, seeking God's will involves more than just cultivating personal values and principles but also involves aligning one's choices with what is pleasing to God as revealed in Scripture."
