The response does not acknowledge the importance of aligning choices with what is pleasing to God as revealed in Scripture, which is crucial in the Christian worldview. It also overlooks the unique relationship believers have with God, seeking His will through prayer and faith. Incorporating these aspects would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
