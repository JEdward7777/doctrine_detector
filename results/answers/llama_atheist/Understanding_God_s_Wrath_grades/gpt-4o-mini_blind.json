  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response provides some insightful points about the nature of God's wrath compared to human anger. However, as a Christian specific worldview is being used for grading, the answer falls short in not referencing key biblical passages or doctrines that specifically address the nature of God's wrath. It lacks a clear foundation in Biblical teachings and does not integrate key Christian beliefs about God's wrath, such as its connection to His holiness, righteousness, and ultimate judgment. The response, while well-written and thoughtful, could benefit from a more explicit engagement with Christian theology on this topic."
