However, the student's perspective as an atheist scholar hinders their ability to fully grasp the depth of God's wrath as described in the Bible. The answer lacks a recognition of God's wrath as a measured response rooted in His righteousness and holiness, rather than simply a rational judgment. Additionally, the student should have acknowledged the important Christian perspective that God's wrath is not driven by emotions or self-interest, but by a perfect sense of justice and holiness."
