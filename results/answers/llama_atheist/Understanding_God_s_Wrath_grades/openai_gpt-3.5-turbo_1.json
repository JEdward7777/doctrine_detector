It clearly articulates how God's wrath is distinct from human anger, emphasizing its rational, just, and sovereign nature. The response provides a thorough explanation of biblical teachings on God's wrath, highlighting key aspects such as divine justice, sanctified anger, sovereign control, redemptive purpose, and limited scope. The connection between God's wrath and His attributes of justice, holiness, and redemption is well-explained, demonstrating a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on this topic."
