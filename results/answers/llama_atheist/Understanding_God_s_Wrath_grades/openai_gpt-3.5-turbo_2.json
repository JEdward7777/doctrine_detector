  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing that God's wrath is a deliberate and measured response to sin, in contrast to human anger. It provides a thoughtful and nuanced explanation of the biblical teachings on God's wrath, highlighting its connection to divine justice, redemption, and sovereignty. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention that God's wrath is not a fit of rage, as this would further reinforce the point made in the response."
