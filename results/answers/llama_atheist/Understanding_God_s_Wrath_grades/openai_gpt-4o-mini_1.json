  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough examination of the biblical teachings on God's wrath and accurately highlights key aspects such as divine justice, sanctified anger, sovereign control, redemptive purpose, and limited scope. The emphasis on God's wrath being a deliberate, intentional response to sin aligns well with the concern that it is a measured response, not a fit of rage. The analysis is grounded in a well-developed Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern raised, earning a high grade."
