  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough and insightful examination of the biblical teachings on God's wrath, emphasizing the key aspects related to divine justice, sanctified anger, sovereign control, redemptive purpose, and limited scope. The emphasis on God's wrath as a deliberate, intentional response to sin, rather than a fit of rage, aligns well with the concern provided. The integration of Christian-specific worldview in discussing God's wrath is well done, showing a clear understanding of the theological concepts involved. The response could be further enhanced by tying the discussion more explicitly to the Christian worldview and emphasizing God's attributes of love and mercy alongside His wrath."
