However, it tends to focus more on secular and atheistic viewpoints rather than providing a strong Christian-specific analysis. While it acknowledges the definition of grace as unearned favor from God, it falls short in emphasizing the Christian understanding of God's unmerited favor as a core belief in the faith. The response could have included more scriptural references or theological insights to deepen the discussion from a Christian worldview."
