  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provides a comprehensive explanation of guilt from a cultural perspective within the biblical context, their analysis lacks a crucial element from a Christian worldview - the acknowledgment of guilt as directly connected to disobeying God and the need for repentance and forgiveness. The student's answer is informative but falls short in highlighting the core Christian understanding of guilt."
