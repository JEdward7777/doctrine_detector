However, the focus is primarily on the historical and social contexts of guilt, without directly addressing the need for repentance and forgiveness in the Christian worldview. While the explanation is well-researched and articulated, it falls short in fully addressing the concern regarding the significance of guilt for recognizing the need for repentance and forgiveness from a Christian perspective."
