  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and well-researched explanation of the biblical definitions of \"heaven\" and \"sky.\" They have demonstrated a solid understanding of the nuances between these terms in biblical language and provided scriptural references to support their interpretation. The student could further enhance their answer by acknowledging the New Testament perspective on \"heaven\" and how it differs from the Old Testament understanding. Overall, a good response with room for minor improvements."
