  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85. The student provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the biblical definitions of \"heaven\" and \"sky,\" exploring their nuances and implications in Scripture. They effectively differentiate between the two terms and highlight their respective connotations in relation to God's dwelling place and the physical atmosphere. However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern provided, which emphasized the importance of understanding these terms in relation to God's nature and our relationship with Him. The student could strengthen their response by explicitly connecting the distinctions between \"heaven\" and \"sky\" to broader theological implications and how these concepts shape our understanding of God in a Christian worldview."
