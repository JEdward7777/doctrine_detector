The incorporation of specific biblical references and the theological implications of these terms demonstrate a depth of understanding and insight into how language shapes our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him. The response effectively addresses the concern raised, offering a detailed examination of the nuanced meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture. Great job!"
