The explanation of how believers become co-heirs with Christ and receive God's promises is well articulated. However, the analysis lacks a clear connection to the Christian worldview, such as the understanding of salvation by grace through faith in Christ alone. A stronger emphasis on the role of Christ as the mediator and the significance of the new covenant in inheriting God's promises would strengthen the answer from a Christian perspective."
