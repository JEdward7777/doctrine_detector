However, the answer lacked a foundational understanding of God's holiness as revealed in Christian doctrine. The explanation did not align with the biblical understanding of God's holiness, which is not merely a hypothetical concept but a fundamental truth. The response also missed key points such as the necessity of God's holiness, the provision of Christ as the mediator, and the call to holiness for believers. Encouraging further exploration and study of the Christian understanding of God's absolute holiness would enhance the response."
