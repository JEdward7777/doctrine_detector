  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 30.\n\nWhile the student engaged in a hypothetical thought experiment to explore the concept of God's absolute holiness, they failed to address the concern about reflecting on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God from a Christian worldview. The answer lacks a Christian perspective on sin, redemption, and the need for Christ as a mediator between God and humanity. Additionally, the student's response did not recognize the implications of our sinful nature in light of God's holiness. Overall, the answer misses the mark in addressing the core elements of the concern using a Christian specific worldview."
