  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of God's absolute holiness and its implications for human relationship with Him. The student acknowledges the inherent separation between God and humanity, the need for mediation, and the consequences of human actions. Additionally, the student provides insightful speculations about the incomprehensibility of such a Being. However, the response would benefit from a more explicit connection to the specific concern of the prompt, which emphasizes the need for reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God."
