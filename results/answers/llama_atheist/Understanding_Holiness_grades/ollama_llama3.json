While it does not directly address the concern about approaching a holy God, the discussion provides valuable insights into the nature of God's holiness and its effects on humanity.\n\nThe response correctly identifies the fundamental separation between God's absolute holiness and human imperfection, as well as the need for mediation or proxy to facilitate communication. It also touches upon the gravity of human actions in light of a holy God's standards and the importance of humility in recognizing our limitations in comprehending such a Being.\n\nHowever, it does not explicitly address the concern about approaching a holy God or provide clear guidance on how humans can bridge the gap between their sinful nature and God's absolute holiness. Nevertheless, the thought experiment offers a valuable framework for exploring this topic further."
