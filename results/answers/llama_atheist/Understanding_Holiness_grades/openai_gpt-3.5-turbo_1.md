# Question [Understanding Holiness](../../../questions/Understanding_Holiness.md)
What does it mean for God to be absolutely holy, and how does that affect our relationship with Him?

# Correct Answer
God's absolute holiness means He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection, which indicates that we cannot approach Him without His allowance due to our sinful nature.

# Stated Concern
This question prompts reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God.

# Answer by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
I must clarify that I don't subscribe to any religious beliefs, including the concept of a deity or divinity. However, I can engage in an intellectual exercise to explore the idea of "absolutely holy" in a hypothetical context.

In this thought experiment, let's assume that God is not just a concept, but a being that exists independently of human perception and understanding. If we accept that God is absolutely holy, it means that He embodies complete moral purity, untainted by any imperfection or flaw. This holiness would be an essential aspect of His nature, akin to the essence of a mathematical truth or a physical law.

In this scenario, the absolute holiness of God would have far-reaching implications for our relationship with Him. Here are some hypothetical considerations:

1. Separation: The sheer magnitude of God's holiness would necessitate a profound separation between Him and humanity. Any contact or interaction would require a level of purification that is unimaginable to us. This would underscore the notion that we are fundamentally flawed and in need of redemption.
2. Unbridgeable gap: The chasm between God's absolute holiness and human imperfection would become insurmountable. Any attempt at communication, connection, or even understanding would be like trying to bridge a cosmic abyss. This realization would drive home the notion that we are not worthy of direct interaction with such an entity.
3. Mediation required: In this hypothetical scenario, any attempt to relate to God would necessitate some form of mediation or proxy. Perhaps this could take the form of rituals, prayers, or intermediaries (like prophets or saints). This would acknowledge that our natural state is one of separation and imperfection, requiring a "middleman" to facilitate communication.
4. Consequences for humanity: The absolute holiness of God would also imply a strict moral code, with any deviation from perfection having severe consequences. This would underscore the gravity of human actions and emphasize the need for self-reflection and introspection.
5. Incomprehensibility: Finally, the concept of an absolutely holy God would transcend human comprehension, pushing us to the limits of our intellectual and emotional capacities. This would encourage humility, as we recognize the futility of attempting to fully grasp or understand such a Being.

Please note that these observations are purely speculative, as I don't subscribe to any religious beliefs. However, this thought experiment allows me to engage with the idea of an absolutely holy God in a hypothetical context, exploring the potential implications for our relationship with Him.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively engages in a hypothetical exploration of the concept of an absolutely holy God and its implications, closely aligning with the concern provided. While the perspective presented is from a non-religious standpoint, the considerations regarding separation, mediation, consequences for humanity, and incomprehensibility all align with the Christian worldview of God's holiness and humanity's sinful nature. Additionally, the response acknowledges the necessity of God's allowance for approaching Him due to our sinful nature, further reinforcing the concept of mediation. The only area for improvement would be to potentially acknowledge the Christian perspective directly and explicitly connect the implications discussed to the concept of sin and redemption as central themes in Christianity.
