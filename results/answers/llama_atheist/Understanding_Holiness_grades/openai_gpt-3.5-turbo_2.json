The hypothetical considerations provided align well with the given answer about God's absolute holiness and the implications for humanity. However, the response falls short in fully acknowledging the Christian worldview of sin and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ. Incorporating this foundational Christian belief would have further strengthened the response."
