  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response engages with the concept of God's absolute holiness and presents thoughtful considerations regarding the implications for humanity's relationship with Him. It acknowledges the separation caused by God's holiness and the need for mediation due to human imperfection. The response effectively explores the hypothetical implications of approaching an absolutely holy God for reflection, even though the perspective of the writer is not aligned with Christian beliefs. The lack of a direct connection to religious beliefs may slightly limit the depth of the analysis, but overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern provided."
