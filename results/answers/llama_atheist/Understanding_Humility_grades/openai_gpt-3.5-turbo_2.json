  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-rounded and insightful analysis of humility in relation to one's relationship with God from a secular perspective, considering historical context and Christian traditions. It effectively explores the concept of humility in acknowledging human limitations and dependence on divine mercy. However, the response could have integrated more explicitly Christian theological perspectives or scripture references to further strengthen the analysis from a Christian worldview."
