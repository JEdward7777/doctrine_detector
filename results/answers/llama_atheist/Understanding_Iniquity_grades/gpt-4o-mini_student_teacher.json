  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the nuances of Hebrew terminology related to sin, iniquity, and transgression. They effectively explain the distinctions between the terms and provide relevant biblical examples. However, the student could have connected these distinctions more directly to how Christians can recognize the gravity of their actions and seek repentance, as stated in the concern. Overall, a well-researched and insightful response from a Christian worldview."
