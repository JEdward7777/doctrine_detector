However, from a Christian perspective, they have missed the crucial aspect of innocence being imputed or granted to believers through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. In Christian doctrine, it is not solely about moral purity but also about being justified before God through faith in Jesus. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the New Testament teachings on innocence and how Jesus himself was wrongfully accused and yet remained truly innocent."
