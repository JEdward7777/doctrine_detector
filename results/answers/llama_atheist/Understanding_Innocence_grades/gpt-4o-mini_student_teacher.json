  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful response that delved into the concept of innocence from a biblical perspective. However, the answer strayed from the specific biblical definition of innocence by focusing more on moral purity and integrity. The biblical teaching emphasizes that innocence in the context of being wrongfully accused means not having committed the alleged wrongdoing, rather than solely focusing on maintaining moral integrity. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but missed the central point of innocence as outlined in the reference answer."
