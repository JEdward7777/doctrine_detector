  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of \"innocence\" in the biblical context. They provide a detailed analysis of the concept, citing relevant scriptures and the example of Job. Their neutral and culturally responsible approach is commendable. However, the response could benefit from a more direct connection to the specific concern of the question, which focuses on the implications of innocence for justice and mercy in Christian teachings."
