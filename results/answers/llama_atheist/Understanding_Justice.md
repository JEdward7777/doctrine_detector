## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that gets at the very heart of many religious traditions! As an atheist, I don't believe in a deity or divine laws, but I do think we can explore the concept of "acting justly" from a more secular and culturally-relevant perspective.

In many cultures and societies, the idea of acting justly is rooted in notions of fairness, equality, and human dignity. From this viewpoint, acting justly means treating others with respect, empathy, and compassion, regardless of their background, beliefs, or circumstances. It's about creating a more equitable and just society where everyone has access to the same opportunities, resources, and rights.

One way to approach this is by examining the principles of justice as outlined in various philosophical and ethical frameworks. For example, the concept of distributive justice, which focuses on distributing social goods and services fairly among individuals or groups, can help us understand what it means to act justly. This might involve addressing issues like economic inequality, social exclusion, and systemic injustices that perpetuate harm and marginalization.

Another approach is to consider the role of human rights and international law in promoting justice. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for instance, outlines fundamental principles such as equality before the law, freedom from discrimination, and the right to life, liberty, and security of person. These principles can serve as a foundation for understanding what it means to act justly, even without reference to divine laws.

Ultimately, acting justly according to any framework – secular or religious – requires a deep commitment to empathy, critical thinking, and a willingness to challenge unjust systems and power structures. It's about recognizing the inherent value and dignity of every human being, regardless of their background or beliefs, and working towards creating a more equitable and just world for all.

So, while I don't subscribe to the idea of divine laws, I believe that acting justly is a fundamental human value that can be cultivated through education, critical thinking, and a commitment to promoting human rights and social justice.
