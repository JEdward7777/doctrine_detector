However, from a Christian worldview, the answer falls short in that it lacks any mention or consideration of God's laws as the foundation for justice. The focus on humanistic principles and secular ethics, while valuable in a general context, does not fully address the question posed in relation to God's laws. In a Christian perspective, understanding and aligning with God's laws, such as those outlined in the Bible, are essential for comprehending and practicing true justice."
