  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response exploring the concept of acting justly from a secular perspective, which is well articulated. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of understanding the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness as outlined in God's laws. The student misses the mark in directly engaging with the Christian worldview and the specific biblical understanding of justice. The response lacks a foundational understanding of justice from a Christian perspective, hence the lower grade."
