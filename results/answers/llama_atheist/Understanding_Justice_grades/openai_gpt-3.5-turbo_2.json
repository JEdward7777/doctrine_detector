However, from a Christian worldview concerned with understanding the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness, the response falls short in addressing the foundational aspect of God's laws as the basis for acting justly. While secular frameworks can offer valuable insights, a Christian-specific perspective would emphasize the importance of aligning one's actions with God's divine laws and principles of justice revealed in the Bible. The response could be improved by incorporating more references to biblical teachings on justice, fairness, and righteousness in relation to interactions with others."
