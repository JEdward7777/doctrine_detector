The response does not engage with the specific Christian worldview of justice rooted in God's laws. There is a lack of integration of biblical principles and teachings into the discussion, which is essential for a Christian perspective. The response could have been improved by acknowledging and incorporating the biblical understanding of justice into the reasoning presented."
