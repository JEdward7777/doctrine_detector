  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response provides a thoughtful exploration of the concept of acting justly from a secular perspective, it falls short in addressing the concern of understanding the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness in interactions with others. As a Christian, the primary basis for understanding fairness and righteousness comes from God's laws as revealed in the Bible. The response did not engage with this foundational aspect, resulting in a lower grade."
