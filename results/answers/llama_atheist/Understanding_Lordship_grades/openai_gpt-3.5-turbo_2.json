The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the term \"Lord\" in relation to Jesus and God for recognizing their authority and divinity. The incorporation of biblical references and explanations adds depth to the analysis from a Christian worldview. However, the inclusion of a perspective from an atheistic scholar, while insightful in bringing in a different viewpoint, may dilute the focus on the Christian-specific understanding of the term \"Lord.\""
