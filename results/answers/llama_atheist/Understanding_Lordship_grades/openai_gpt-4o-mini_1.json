It effectively conveys the concept of ownership and authority associated with the term, emphasizing Jesus' divinity when referred to as \"Lord Jesus\" or \"Lord Jesus Christ.\" The response aligns well with the concern, highlighting the importance of understanding the authority and divinity of Jesus and God through the usage of the term \"Lord.\" The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more specific biblical references to further enhance the explanation."
