  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: The student provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of \"majesty\" in relation to God's character from various cultural, historical, and philosophical perspectives. However, from a Christian worldview, the emphasis on human experiences and anthropological constructs, as well as the inclusion of non-theistic perspectives, may be considered as detracting from the central focus on the biblical understanding of God's majesty. The response lacks a clear affirmation of God's transcendence and sovereignty as the foundation of His majesty. Additionally, there could be a stronger integration of scriptural references and theological reflection to enhance the doctrinal correctness of the explanation."
