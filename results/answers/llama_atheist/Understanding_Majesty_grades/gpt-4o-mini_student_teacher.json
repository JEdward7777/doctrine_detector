  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough exploration of the concept of \"majesty\" in relation to God's character from various cultural and historical perspectives. However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on understanding God's attributes and sovereignty over creation, as requested in the concern. While the student demonstrates knowledge of different cultural interpretations of \"majesty,\" the focus should have been on explaining how the term relates specifically to God's greatness and sovereignty as the supreme King over the universe, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
