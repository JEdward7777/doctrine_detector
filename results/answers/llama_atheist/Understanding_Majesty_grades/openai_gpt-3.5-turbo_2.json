It effectively highlighted how the term 'majesty' signifies the greatness and splendor of God as the supreme King over the universe, connecting it to His attributes and sovereignty over creation. The discussion provided valuable insights from a scholarly standpoint while maintaining a Christian worldview. However, there could have been more emphasis on the ultimate authority of God in the context of His sovereignty over creation to align more closely with the given concern."
