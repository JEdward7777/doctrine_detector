  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85 \n\nComment: The response does a good job of exploring the concept of \"majesty\" in relation to God's character from both a cultural anthropology and historical perspective, as well as within Christian theology. The student effectively discusses how the term is used to convey God's greatness and sovereignty over creation. However, the response could have delved deeper into the significance of God's sovereignty over creation and how this relates to the concept of \"majesty.\" Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of God's attributes and sovereignty within a Christian worldview."
