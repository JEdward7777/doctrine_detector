From a Christian perspective, mercy is not solely about humanistic values and shared humanity but is rooted in an understanding of God's ultimate compassion and forgiveness towards humanity. The response could have included references to biblical teachings on mercy and emphasized the role of God as the ultimate example of mercy that believers should strive to emulate in their interactions with others. This missed opportunity reduces the overall effectiveness of the response in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview."
