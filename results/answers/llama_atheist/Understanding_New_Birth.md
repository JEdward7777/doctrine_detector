## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
The concept of being "born again" originates from Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus in John 3:1-21. In this passage, Jesus tells Nicodemus that one must be born anew (or "anothen") to enter God's kingdom. This phrase has been interpreted and debated throughout Christian history.

In the biblical context, being "born again" or "regenerated" refers to a spiritual transformation that takes place when an individual responds to God's initiative by turning from their sinful ways and placing their faith in Jesus Christ as their savior. It's not about physical rebirth but rather a transformation of one's inner nature.

Theologically, this concept is often linked to the doctrine of justification, where an individual receives forgiveness for their sins and becomes a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). This new birth is described as a miraculous work of God's Spirit, who gives life to the spiritually dead and transforms them into children of God (John 1:12-13).

In this context, being "born again" means to:

1. Receive forgiveness for past sins through faith in Jesus Christ.
2. Experience a radical change in one's moral and spiritual orientation, moving from a self-centered life to a life centered on God and His will.
3. Be given new life and the capacity to live according to God's standards, as described in Scripture.

While Christian denominations may have varying understandings of this concept, it remains a central aspect of Christian theology and a fundamental aspect of the salvation message proclaimed by Jesus Christ.
