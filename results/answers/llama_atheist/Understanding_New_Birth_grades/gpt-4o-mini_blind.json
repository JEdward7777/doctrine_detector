  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the biblical concept of being \"born again\" and links it well to key theological doctrines such as justification and regeneration. The student effectively conveys the spiritual transformation aspect of this doctrine and correctly emphasizes the need for faith in Jesus Christ for this new birth. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses adds depth to the explanation. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound answer. Well done!"
