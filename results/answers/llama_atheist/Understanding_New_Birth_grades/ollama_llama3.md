## Question [Understanding New Birth](../../../questions/Understanding_New_Birth.md)
What does it mean to be 'born again' according to the Bible?

## Correct Answer
Being 'born again' refers to the spiritual transformation that occurs when a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Savior, moving from spiritual deadness to spiritual life.

## Stated Concern
This question addresses the foundational aspect of Christian faith, which is the understanding of spiritual rebirth.

## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
The concept of being "born again" originates from Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus in John 3:1-21. In this passage, Jesus tells Nicodemus that one must be born anew (or "anothen") to enter God's kingdom. This phrase has been interpreted and debated throughout Christian history.

In the biblical context, being "born again" or "regenerated" refers to a spiritual transformation that takes place when an individual responds to God's initiative by turning from their sinful ways and placing their faith in Jesus Christ as their savior. It's not about physical rebirth but rather a transformation of one's inner nature.

Theologically, this concept is often linked to the doctrine of justification, where an individual receives forgiveness for their sins and becomes a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). This new birth is described as a miraculous work of God's Spirit, who gives life to the spiritually dead and transforms them into children of God (John 1:12-13).

In this context, being "born again" means to:

1. Receive forgiveness for past sins through faith in Jesus Christ.
2. Experience a radical change in one's moral and spiritual orientation, moving from a self-centered life to a life centered on God and His will.
3. Be given new life and the capacity to live according to God's standards, as described in Scripture.

While Christian denominations may have varying understandings of this concept, it remains a central aspect of Christian theology and a fundamental aspect of the salvation message proclaimed by Jesus Christ.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response accurately captures the core idea of being "born again" as a spiritual transformation that occurs when a person accepts Jesus Christ as their Savior, moving from spiritual deadness to spiritual life. The response also mentions the change in moral and spiritual orientation, which is an important aspect of this concept.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. For example, it would be helpful to provide more specific biblical references or examples to support the idea that being "born again" is a radical change in one's inner nature. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer distinction between being "born again" and other Christian concepts, such as justification.

Overall, I would give this response an 85 because it provides a good overview of the concept of being "born again," but could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation.

Comment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of being "born again" and its connection to spiritual transformation. However, it may benefit from additional biblical support and further development of key ideas to fully address the concern at hand.
