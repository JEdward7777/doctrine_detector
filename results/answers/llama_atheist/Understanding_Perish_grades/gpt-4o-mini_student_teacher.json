  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 40/100. \n\nWhile the student provides a thorough analysis of the cultural and linguistic nuances surrounding the concept of \"perish\" in the New Testament, their atheistic perspective leads to a lack of acknowledgment and exploration of the deeper spiritual implications of spiritual separation from God. The student's focus on cultural context and avoidance of supernatural realms limits the depth of their understanding in addressing the concern of spiritual separation from God. A more holistic approach that integrates the Christian worldview and theological implications would have strengthened the response."
