  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical and cultural contexts of the concept of \"perish\" in the New Testament. They provide multiple examples from various texts, exploring both literal and metaphorical usages of the term. The inclusion of the concern about spiritual separation from God is also acknowledged and addressed. \n\nHowever, the student's atheism and avoidance of supernatural interpretations may be seen as limiting the full depth of the discussion, particularly in relation to the traditional Christian understanding of salvation and eternal life."
