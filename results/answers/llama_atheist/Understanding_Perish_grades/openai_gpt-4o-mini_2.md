## [Answer](../Understanding_Perish.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A question that requires a nuanced and culturally responsible approach! As an atheistic scholar, I'll avoid making assumptions about supernatural realms or afterlives, but instead focus on the cultural context and linguistic nuances of the New Testament.

In the New Testament, "perish" (Greek: ἀπολλύμμι, apollymi) is a verb that can carry various connotations depending on its context. When used spiritually, it often implies separation from God, divine judgment, or spiritual death.

In Matthew 10:28, Jesus says, "Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell." Here, "perish" (apollymi) is used to describe the ultimate destruction or annihilation of one's being, whether that be a physical death or a spiritual one.

In Mark 9:43-44, Jesus teaches, "If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out. It is better for you to lose one part of your physical body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. Where 'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'" In this passage, "perish" (apollymi) is used metaphorically to describe the eternal torment or suffering that awaits those who reject Jesus.

In other contexts, such as John 3:36, "Whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life," "perish" may imply spiritual death or separation from God's love. In this case, it suggests a state of being cut off from the divine and thus lacking eternal life.

It's essential to recognize that these uses of "perish" are rooted in the cultural and historical context of ancient Mediterranean societies, where the concept of an afterlife was common. The New Testament authors likely drew upon this shared understanding when employing "perish" as a metaphor for spiritual destruction or judgment.

In conclusion, while I don't endorse supernatural interpretations, it's clear that in the New Testament, "perish" is often used to convey the idea of spiritual separation, divine judgment, or eternal suffering.
