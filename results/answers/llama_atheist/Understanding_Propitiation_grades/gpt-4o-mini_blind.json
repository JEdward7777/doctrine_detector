The student effectively conveys the theological importance of Jesus' sacrifice in satisfying God's justice, reconciling humanity to God, and fulfilling prophecy. The explanation is clear, supported by scriptural references, and aligns well with Christian doctrine on propitiation and atonement. Great job!"
