  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of propitiation, addressing various aspects such as divine justice, reconciliation, representation, and fulfillment of prophecy. The student effectively tied Jesus' sacrifice to the concept of propitiation and its relationship to God's justice and mercy. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly stating the central idea that Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath, as highlighted in the reference answer."
