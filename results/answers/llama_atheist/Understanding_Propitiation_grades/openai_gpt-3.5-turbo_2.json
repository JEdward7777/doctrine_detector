It clearly articulates how Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath, while also emphasizing the aspect of mercy in providing forgiveness and eternal life for sinners. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the balance between God's justice and mercy in the concept of propitiation within a Christian worldview."
