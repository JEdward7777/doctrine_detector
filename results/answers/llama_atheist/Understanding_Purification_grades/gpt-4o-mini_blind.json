The student missed the opportunity to explore the deeper spiritual meanings and implications of purification rituals as outlined in the Old Testament, such as the themes of sin, atonement, and holiness. A more comprehensive understanding of the topic would require integrating both the cultural/historical context and the theological significance to provide a well-rounded analysis."
