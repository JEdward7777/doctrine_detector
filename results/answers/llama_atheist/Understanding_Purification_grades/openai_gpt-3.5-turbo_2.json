However, it falls short of addressing the concern regarding how the process of ritual purification reflects God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin from a Christian worldview. It neglects the theological significance of purification rituals in relation to God's holiness and the need for cleansing from sin, which is a crucial aspect when examining this topic through a Christian-specific lens."
