However, it falls short of addressing the concern about how ritual purification reflects God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin from a Christian worldview. The explanation lacks any theological depth or reference to God's role in establishing these purification practices as part of His covenant with the Israelites. To fully address the concern, it is essential to incorporate biblical teachings on holiness, sin, and the sacrificial system as revealed in the Old Testament."
