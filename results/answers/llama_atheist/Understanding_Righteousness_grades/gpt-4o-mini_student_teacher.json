  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough exploration of various perspectives on the concept of a righteous God, the answer lacks a clear understanding of God's righteousness as defined in the Christian worldview. The answer does not directly address the reference answer's definition of God's righteousness as His absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love. The response falls short in connecting the importance of understanding God's righteousness with His justice and love, which are foundational attributes in Christianity."
