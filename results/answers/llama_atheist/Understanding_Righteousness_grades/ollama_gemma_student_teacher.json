  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and nuanced understanding of the concept of a righteous God from an atheistic perspective. They provide a comprehensive analysis of various interpretations and perspectives on the topic, including the analytical, moral, and cultural aspects. The student's critical examination of the concept and their willingness to question traditional assumptions receive high marks. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian-specific worldview and its understanding of God's righteousness."
