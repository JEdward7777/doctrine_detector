There is a lack of emphasis on God's absolute goodness, justice, faithfulness, and love, which are crucial components of His righteousness according to a Christian worldview. The response focuses more on human interpretations and atheistic viewpoints, neglecting the core Christian perspective on God's righteousness in relation to His justice and love."
