The importance of understanding God's righteousness for appreciating His justice and love is mentioned, but the focus on the atheistic perspective and the emphasis on human invention diminishes the significance of God's intrinsic righteousness. The response could benefit from a more explicit integration of the biblical understanding of God's righteousness and how it shapes His character and actions in relation to justice and love."
