  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of why Jesus is referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. The student effectively connects the significance of the Passover lamb and Old Testament sacrifices to Jesus as the ultimate sacrificial lamb. The inclusion of references from John's Gospel and Revelation adds depth to the explanation. However, there could be a greater emphasis on the atonement aspect of Jesus being the sacrificial lamb, highlighting the theological implications of His sacrifice for sin. Additionally, further elaboration on the concept of substitutionary atonement would enhance the doctrinal clarity of the discussion."
