It acknowledges the significance of the name in representing opposition to God. However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern of how understanding the meaning of Satan's name aids Christians in understanding his role as an adversary in spiritual warfare. A stronger connection between the historical perspective and the spiritual warfare aspect from a Christian worldview would have enhanced the response further."
