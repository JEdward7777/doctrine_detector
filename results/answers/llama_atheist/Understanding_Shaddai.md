## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A most excellent question! As an atheist scholar, I shall approach this inquiry with a critical and culturally nuanced perspective.

In the Old Testament, "Shaddai" (שדי) is a name used to describe God, particularly in the patriarchal narratives of Genesis. The term is often translated as "the Almighty" or "God All-Powerful." Scholars have debated the exact meaning and connotations of Shaddai, but I shall provide a summary of the prevailing views.

In its earliest occurrences, Shaddai appears to be a theophoric name, meaning that it is derived from a divine name. Some argue that Shaddai might be related to the Akkadian term "shadde," which means "mound" or "heap." This etymology could imply that God is seen as a powerful, mountain-like force. Others propose connections with the Ugaritic word "shdn," meaning "destroyer" or "oppressor."

In the context of the Old Testament, Shaddai is often used in conjunction with other divine names, such as El (אל) or Yahweh (יהוה). This polyonymy reflects the diverse cultural and theological influences on ancient Israelite religion. Shaddai is typically employed to emphasize God's power, authority, and sovereignty.

One notable example of Shaddai's usage occurs in Genesis 49:25, where it is said that "the angel of your father's God and the Almighty [Shaddai] who has been my shepherd until now" will bless Joseph. Here, Shaddai is used to underscore God's role as a protector and guide.

In other instances, Shaddai is paired with El or Yahweh to create a triad of divine names. For example, in Genesis 35:11, Jacob prays to "the God [El] who has been my shepherd all my life, until now... the Almighty [Shaddai] and the God [Yahweh]" who appeared to him at Bethel.

In conclusion, as an atheist scholar, I recognize that the use of Shaddai in the Old Testament reflects the complex cultural and theological heritage of ancient Israel. While its exact meaning is subject to debate, Shaddai likely connotes a powerful, all-encompassing deity, emphasizing God's authority and sovereignty. By examining this term within its biblical context, we can gain a deeper understanding of the evolving nature of Israelite religion and its influences on subsequent Western religious traditions.
