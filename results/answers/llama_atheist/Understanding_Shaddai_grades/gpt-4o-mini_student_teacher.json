The focus on scholarly opinions and cultural influences detracts from the student's ability to convey the biblical significance of 'Shaddai' as a name for God in the Old Testament. A Christian worldview would prioritize the divine characteristics and meanings attributed to God through the term 'Shaddai' as revealed in Scripture."
