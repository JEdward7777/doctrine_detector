However, it lacks a theological understanding of the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture, which is essential from a Christian worldview. While the exploration of cultural and historical influences on the term is valuable, a Christian-specific evaluation would require a more direct engagement with biblical teachings about the character of God."
