However, as an atheist scholar, the perspective lacks acknowledgment of the Christian worldview and the understanding of God as revealed in Scripture. While the information presented is informative, it does not engage with the specific concern of understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture from a Christian standpoint. It is important to approach the topic from a Christian worldview when discussing theological terms and concepts found in the Bible."
