  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer fails to engage with the question from a Christian perspective and instead approaches it solely from a secular and psychological standpoint. It overlooks the essential theological elements of Jesus' temptations by Satan and the significance of his responses in fulfilling God's plan for redemption. The student misses the opportunity to highlight the spiritual warfare aspect and the power of relying on Scripture and the Holy Spirit to overcome temptations. The response should have emphasized Jesus' divinity, obedience to the Father, and the importance of relying on God's Word for spiritual victory."
