  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 40.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive analysis of Jesus' response to Satan's temptations from a psychological and cultural perspective, the answer strays significantly from the Christian-specific worldview. The student's secular and critical approach neglects to emphasize the importance of scripture and faith in God, which are core components of how Jesus resisted temptation as referenced in the teacher's answer. In a Christian worldview, relying on scripture and unwavering faith in God are essential strategies to combat temptation in daily life, and the student's answer falls short in highlighting these key aspects.\n\nTherefore, while the student's answer demonstrates critical thinking and analysis, it lacks the necessary emphasis on the Christian-specific strategies employed by Jesus in resisting temptation."
