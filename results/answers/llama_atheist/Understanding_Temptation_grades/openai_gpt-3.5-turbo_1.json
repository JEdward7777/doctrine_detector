The scholar primarily focuses on cognitive and cultural interpretations rather than emphasizing the role of scripture and faith in overcoming temptation, which is crucial for a Christian worldview. There is merit in exploring various perspectives, but the response could have been strengthened by placing more emphasis on the spiritual aspect of combating temptation as exemplified by Jesus."
