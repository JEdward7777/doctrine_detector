  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides insightful analysis from a psychological and cultural perspective, it falls short of addressing the concern of understanding how to combat temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. The focus on cognitive mechanisms and cultural context, while relevant, neglects to emphasize the essential role of scripture and faith in overcoming temptation, which are foundational principles for Christians. The response could earn a higher grade by integrating the importance of scripture and faith more prominently in the discussion of combating temptation in alignment with a Christian worldview."
