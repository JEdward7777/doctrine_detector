The analysis focuses more on the psychological and cultural aspects rather than emphasizing the foundational role of scripture and faith in combating temptation, which is essential for a follower of Christ. It would have been stronger if the response had integrated how relying on scripture and unwavering faith, as seen in Jesus' actions, can serve as practical guidance for believers in overcoming temptations in daily life."
