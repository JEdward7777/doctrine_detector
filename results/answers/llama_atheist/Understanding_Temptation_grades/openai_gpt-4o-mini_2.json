The focus on coping mechanisms and reframing strategies, while informative, detracts from the central premise of relying on scripture and unwavering faith in God to combat temptation as a follower of Christ. The response could be strengthened by emphasizing the significance of scripture and faith as foundational pillars in resisting temptation in alignment with a Christian worldview."
