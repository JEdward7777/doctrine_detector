# Answer by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must clarify that my analysis will be based on the cultural and historical context of the Bible, rather than any personal beliefs or values.

In a Biblical context, "transgress" (Hebrew: עָבַר, avar) or "to go beyond" implies a departure from the established norms, laws, or boundaries set by God or humanity. It often carries a negative connotation, implying disobedience, rebellion, or sin.

In the Hebrew Bible, transgressing refers to actions that contravene God's commands, such as disobeying His laws (Leviticus 10:3), ignoring His warnings (Exodus 32:7-8), or engaging in idolatry (Deuteronomy 17:2). Transgression can also involve violating human norms, like breaking social contracts or disrespecting authority figures.

In the New Testament, Jesus uses the concept of transgression to describe the failure to live up to God's standards. For example, He speaks of people who "transgress" against the Law (Matthew 5:21) and those who fail to love their neighbors as themselves, thereby transgressing God's command (Mark 12:13-14).

In a broader sense, transgression in the Biblical context can be seen as a metaphor for human fallibility. It acknowledges that people are prone to err and make mistakes, which is why forgiveness, redemption, and restoration become central themes throughout the Bible.

By exploring the concept of transgression within its cultural and historical context, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances of Biblical thought, even if it may not align with our own personal beliefs or values.
