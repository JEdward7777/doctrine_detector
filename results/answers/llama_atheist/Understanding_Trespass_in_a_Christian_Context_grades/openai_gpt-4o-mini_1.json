However, the response's emphasis on the cultural and historical context of Christian beliefs and the mention of faith in Jesus Christ as the mediator could be seen as a deviation from purely addressing the concern of clarifying the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God within Christian ethics. The response effectively discusses the Christian worldview on trespass but could have focused more on directly addressing the concern raised."
