  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough and thoughtful analysis of characteristics of an \"unholy\" life from a secular perspective, the answer strayed significantly from the Christian-specific worldview provided in the reference answer. The student's response focused on societal and individual behaviors without considering the foundational aspect of rebellion against God and dishonoring Him as the core of unholiness. A Christian worldview emphasizes the importance of aligning one's actions with God's will and honoring Him above all else. The student's answer, while well-crafted, did not address this crucial aspect, resulting in a deviation from the Christian perspective on unholiness."
