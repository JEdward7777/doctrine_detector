While it acknowledges important aspects such as lack of empathy, self-centeredness, and injustice, it fails to address the Christian-specific perspective of rebellion against God and actions that dishonor Him. From a Christian worldview, unholiness is fundamentally tied to disobedience to God's commands and living in a manner contrary to His will. The response, though thoughtful and thorough in its analysis, does not align with a Christian understanding of unholiness as rebellion against God."
