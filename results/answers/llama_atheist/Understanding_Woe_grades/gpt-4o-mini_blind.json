  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a well-researched and informative response on the significance of the term \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments. They appropriately discuss the linguistic and cultural implications of the term, as well as provide relevant biblical examples. However, the response could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the divine aspect of judgment and the importance of repentance in the biblical context. Additionally, a stronger connection to the sovereignty of God in executing judgment would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
