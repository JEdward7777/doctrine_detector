  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 75.\n\nThe student provided a detailed and well-researched analysis of the term \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments. They demonstrated an understanding of the linguistic and cultural influences on the term and supported their answer with examples from the Bible. However, while they accurately discussed the historical and cultural background, they did not directly address the implication of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment as the concern specified. The student could strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting the concept of \"woe\" to the consequences of sin and divine judgment in a more focused manner.\n\nOverall, the student exhibited a good level of knowledge and effort in their response, but there is room for improvement in aligning their analysis more closely with the concern provided."
