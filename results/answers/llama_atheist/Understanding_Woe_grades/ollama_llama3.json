  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides some general information about the term \"woe\" in biblical warnings, but it lacks depth and nuance in its understanding of the concept. The given answer only scratches the surface of the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment. While the response mentions some biblical examples, it does not provide a thorough analysis of the cultural and historical contexts that shape the meaning of \"woe\" in these passages.\n\nThe concern is partially addressed by the response's discussion of biblical warnings and judgments, but the answer could be strengthened by exploring more fully the themes of sin, rebellion, and disobedience in relation to divine judgment. To improve the grade, the response should demonstrate a clearer understanding of how the concept of \"woe\" relates to apocalyptic rhetoric and its implications for understanding God's judgment."
