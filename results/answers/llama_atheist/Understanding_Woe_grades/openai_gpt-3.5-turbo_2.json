The mention of specific biblical passages and the connection to ancient cultural practices enhances the explanation. However, it could further strengthen the Christian worldview perspective by explicitly emphasizing the importance of understanding biblical warnings about sin and judgment as part of God's grace and call to repentance for salvation."
