However, the answer lacks a clear stance on the Christian worldview's perspective on worldliness. It is essential to emphasize that from a Christian perspective, worldliness is inherently negative as it pertains to prioritizing earthly desires over God's will. The answer could be improved by explicitly highlighting the contrast between living a worldly lifestyle, focused on temporal concerns, and living a life aligned with biblical principles and values. Including more Scriptural references to support the explanations would also strengthen the response."
