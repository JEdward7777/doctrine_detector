However, the crucial Christian worldview on the significance of worship as a reflection of one's relationship with God is entirely missing in their response. In a Christian context, worship is not just a cultural practice or a means of social bonding, but a vital aspect of expressing love, reverence, and devotion to God. It is important for the student to understand and address this key element when discussing the concept of worship within a Christian worldview."
