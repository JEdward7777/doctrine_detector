However, the Christian specific concern of understanding the metaphorical language in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people is not adequately addressed from a Christian worldview. While the response touches on the concept of God's relationship with Israel, it does not emphasize the theological significance of this metaphor in reflecting God's love, protection, and redemption for His chosen people as seen in a Christian interpretation of the term."
