While it accurately discusses the metaphorical nature of the term and its representation of the people of Israel, it falls short in addressing the concern regarding the implications for God's relationship with His people. A Christian worldview would expect more explicit reference to the spiritual and covenantal aspects of God's relationship with Israel as reflected in Scripture."
