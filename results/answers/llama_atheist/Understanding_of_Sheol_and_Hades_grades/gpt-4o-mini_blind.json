  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: While the student provided an in-depth exploration of the concepts of Sheol and Hades from a neutral perspective, their analysis lacks doctrinal accuracy from a Christian worldview. As an atheistic scholar, the student's interpretation disregards the foundational beliefs of Christian theology regarding the afterlife of the righteous and unrighteous. The explanations also neglect core biblical teachings on salvation, judgment, and the nature of the afterlife. A Christian-specific worldview would require a more accurate alignment with biblical teachings and theological concepts."
