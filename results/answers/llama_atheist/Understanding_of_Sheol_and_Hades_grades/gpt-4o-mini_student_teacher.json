  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and informative response regarding the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the Bible. However, the student's atheistic perspective detracts from addressing the concern of understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the evolving understanding of Sheol and Hades over time as presented in the reference answer. While the student's analysis is insightful, it falls short of fully addressing the specific concern outlined in the question, particularly from a Christian perspective."
