  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and insightful analysis of Jesus Christ as the \"cornerstone\" within Christian theology, emphasizing his role as the foundation, unifying force, source of strength, and guiding light for the Church. The student effectively connects the concept of the cornerstone to biblical references and theological implications. The response addresses the concern by highlighting how understanding Christ's role can impact a believer's faith and community involvement. Overall, the analysis is thorough and demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from an atheistic perspective."
