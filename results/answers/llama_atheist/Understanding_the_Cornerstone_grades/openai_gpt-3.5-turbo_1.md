## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Cornerstone.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
The concept of Jesus Christ as the "cornerstone" is a fascinating one, particularly within the framework of Christian theology. As an atheistic scholar, I'll attempt to provide an objective analysis of this notion.

In biblical contexts, the term "cornerstone" (Hebrew: even shemama; Greek: glyptos) refers to a stone placed at the corner or foundation of a structure, serving as a pivotal point that holds the entire edifice together. In the context of the Assembly of believers, Jesus Christ is often referred to as the cornerstone because he is seen as the central figure who unites and founds the Church.

Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians (2:20) is particularly relevant here, where he writes that Jesus Christ is "the chief corner stone" (KJV), emphasizing his role as the foundation of the Church. This idea is also echoed in Peter's First Epistle (2:6-8), which describes Jesus as the "living stone," who is chosen and precious to God.

In this context, Jesus' status as the cornerstone signifies several key aspects:

1. Foundation: Jesus Christ is seen as the foundation upon which the Church is built. He is the starting point for all subsequent developments in Christian theology and practice.
2. Unity: As the cornerstone, Jesus Christ serves as a unifying force, bringing together diverse individuals and groups within the Assembly to form one cohesive body.
3. Strength: The cornerstone is often seen as the strongest part of a structure, providing stability and resilience against external forces. Similarly, Jesus' presence as the cornerstone gives strength and stability to the Church.
4. Orientation: A cornerstone can also serve as an orientation point, helping to guide and direct those who build upon it. In this sense, Jesus Christ is seen as the guiding force, directing the Assembly towards its divine purpose.

In summary, Jesus Christ as the "cornerstone" in the context of the Assembly of believers represents his role as the foundation, unifying force, source of strength, and guiding light that holds the Church together and gives it direction.
