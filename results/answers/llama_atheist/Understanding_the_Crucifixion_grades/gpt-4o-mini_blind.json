The answer also neglects to emphasize the foundational Christian doctrine of salvation through faith in Christ's redemptive work on the cross. Additionally, the language used could be perceived as minimizing the centrality of Jesus' crucifixion to Christian faith. Further incorporation of doctrinal elements and a clearer articulation of the sacrificial and salvific aspects of the crucifixion would enhance the response."
