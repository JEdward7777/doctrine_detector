  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComment: The student's answer, while providing historical and cultural context, entirely misses the Christian worldview aspect of Jesus Christ's appointment as the judge on the Day of Judgment. From a Christian perspective, Jesus' role as judge is significant because he is not just a moral teacher but the divine Son of God who will judge based on divine righteousness and truth. The student's response neglects this crucial aspect, therefore significantly reducing the grade. There is a lack of understanding or engagement with the Christian beliefs surrounding judgment and Jesus' identity as the appointed judge in this response."
