However, the atheistic perspective adopted by the scholar lacks a Christian worldview lens necessary for fully grasping the depth and significance of being part of the 'elect' in one's faith journey. An exploration of the theological implications and spiritual transformation that accompany being chosen by God could enhance the analysis from a Christian perspective."
