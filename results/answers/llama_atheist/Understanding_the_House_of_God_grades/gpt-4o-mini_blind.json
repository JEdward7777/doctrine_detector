However, it falls short in failing to acknowledge the significant theological and religious significance attached to the term in Christian belief. A Christian-specific worldview would emphasize that the \"house of God\" is not merely a physical structure but also symbolizes the presence of God among His people. Integrating this theological aspect would have enhanced the completeness of the response."
