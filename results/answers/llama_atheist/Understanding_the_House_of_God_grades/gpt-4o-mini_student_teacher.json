  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the historical and cultural significance of the \"house of God\" in biblical context, they neglected to address the deeper spiritual and religious connotations associated with the term. From a Christian worldview, the \"house of God\" is not just a physical structure but also represents the presence of God among His people and a place of worship and communion with Him. By focusing solely on the historical and cultural aspects, the student missed out on highlighting the spiritual significance and meaning of the term 'house of God' as understood in a Christian context."
