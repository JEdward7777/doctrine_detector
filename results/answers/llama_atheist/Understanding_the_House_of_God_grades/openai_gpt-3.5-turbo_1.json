  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed overview of the significance and meaning of the \"house of God\" in Scripture, offering historical and cultural context without directly delving into religious connotations. The explanation effectively clarifies the concept in biblical tradition and links it to ancient Near Eastern cultures, enhancing understanding of the term. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly connect the concept to God's dwelling among His people as a central theme in defining the \"house of God\" in a more impactful manner."
