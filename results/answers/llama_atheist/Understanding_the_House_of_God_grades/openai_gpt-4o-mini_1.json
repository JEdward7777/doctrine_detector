The answer effectively clarifies the concept and its connection to worship, divine presence, and sacred spaces within the biblical tradition. The only minor improvement could be a brief mention of the spiritual symbolism that the \"house of God\" holds for Christian believers, emphasizing the idea of believers themselves being temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19)."
