  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response, while well-written and thought-provoking, diverges significantly from the biblical perspective on the image of God. The biblical understanding is clear and concise, focusing on specific characteristics that directly reflect God's image. The student's answer, though insightful from a secular perspective, does not fully address the question within the Christian worldview framework."
