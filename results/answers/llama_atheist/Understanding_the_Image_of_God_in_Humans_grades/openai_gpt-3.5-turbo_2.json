The emphasis on cultural significance and atheistic perspective detracts from an explicit engagement with the Christian concept of being created in the image of God. The analysis provided is insightful from a secular perspective, but it lacks integration with the specific concern of what it means to reflect the image of God according to a Christian worldview."
