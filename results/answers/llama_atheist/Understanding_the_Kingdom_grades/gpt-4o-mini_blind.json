However, the approach of avoiding theological or dogmatic biases, while scholarly in some contexts, may not fully capture the complete meaning of the term within Christian doctrine. The answer lacks a clear acknowledgment of the theological implications and the divinity of Christ's teachings regarding the Kingdom of God. Additionally, the response could have highlighted the centrality of Jesus as the King of this Kingdom within Christian belief. It is important to integrate theological perspectives when discussing biblical concepts to present a holistic understanding from a Christian worldview."
