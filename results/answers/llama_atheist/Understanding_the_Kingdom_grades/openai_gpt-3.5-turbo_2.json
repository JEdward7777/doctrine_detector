However, it falls short in addressing the concern of understanding God's sovereignty and authority in our lives, as it focuses primarily on the historical context and interpretations of the Kingdom of God in the New Testament. Integrating more explicitly how the concept of the Kingdom of God reflects God's sovereignty and authority over believers and creation would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
