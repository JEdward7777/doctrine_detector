  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings from a Christian perspective. They have covered key aspects such as the fulfillment of Jewish apocalyptic literature, the significance of Jesus' two comings, and the implications for human history and God's plan. However, the student's perspective as an atheist scholar at the end of the response detracts from the overall coherence and consistency of a Christian-specific worldview. It is important to maintain a consistently Christian perspective throughout the answer to address concerns regarding the implications for Christian faith."
