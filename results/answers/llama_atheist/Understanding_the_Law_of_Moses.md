## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As a scholar, I'd be happy to provide you with an overview of the specific commandments included in the Law of Moses. The Law of Moses, also known as the Torah or the Pentateuch, contains 613 commandments, which are divided into three main categories: moral laws, ceremonial laws, and judicial laws.

Moral Laws:

1. To love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength (Deuteronomy 6:5).
2. To love your neighbor as yourself (Leviticus 19:18).
3. Not to murder or kill (Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17).
4. Not to commit adultery or engage in sexual immorality (Exodus 20:17; Leviticus 18:20-23).
5. To honor your parents (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16).

Ceremonial Laws:

1. To observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy (Exodus 20:8-11; Deuteronomy 5:12-15).
2. To celebrate the feasts of Passover, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Pentecost, Tabernacles, and Booths (Leviticus 23:1-44).
3. To bring offerings to God, including burnt offerings, meal offerings, and peace offerings (Leviticus 1-7; Leviticus 14:22-25).

Judicial Laws:

1. Not to steal or take something that doesn't belong to you (Exodus 20:15; Deuteronomy 5:19).
2. To respect the property of others and not covet what belongs to someone else (Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21).
3. To be honest in your business dealings, including weights, measures, and prices (Deuteronomy 25:13-16).
4. To be kind to strangers and provide for their needs (Leviticus 19:34; Deuteronomy 10:18-19).

These are just a few examples of the many commandments included in the Law of Moses. It's important to note that these laws were given specifically to the Israelites as part of their covenant relationship with God, and they were intended to guide their daily lives and decisions.
