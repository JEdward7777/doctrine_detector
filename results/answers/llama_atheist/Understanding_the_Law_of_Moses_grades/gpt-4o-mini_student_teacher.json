The references provided show a comprehensive knowledge of the Old Testament laws. However, the answer could be improved by linking the relevance of these commandments to contemporary Christian belief and practice. Providing examples or explanations on how these laws still influence Christian principles today would enhance the depth of understanding of their relevance."
