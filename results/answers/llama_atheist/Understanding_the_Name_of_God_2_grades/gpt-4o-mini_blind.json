It failed to acknowledge the theological significance of Yahweh as the personal and relational God of monotheistic faith. While the linguistic and scholarly perspectives were informative, the omission of the core theological understanding of Yahweh's nature and character according to the Old Testament teachings significantly detracted from the overall accuracy of the response. Encouragement to deepen understanding of Yahweh within the biblical context is recommended."
