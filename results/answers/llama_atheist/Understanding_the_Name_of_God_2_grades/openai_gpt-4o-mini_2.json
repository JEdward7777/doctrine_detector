However, the atheist perspective presented strays from the Christian-specific worldview as it does not affirm the belief in the divine nature of God. While it explores various interpretations of the name, it falls short of recognizing Yahweh as the personal, relational God of monotheistic faith, which is crucial in understanding His nature and covenant with His people."
