  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical concepts of the human spirit and evil spirit. They clearly articulate the differences between the two, emphasizing their distinct functions and characteristics. The student's inclusion of historical and theological references strengthens their arguments and demonstrates their familiarity with the biblical text. However, the omission of any explicit mention of spiritual experiences or the role of faith in understanding these concepts could be addressed to enhance the Christian-specific worldview perspective."
