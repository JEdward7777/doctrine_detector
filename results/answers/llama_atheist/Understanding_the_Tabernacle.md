## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A great question! As a secular scholar, I'll approach this from a historical and cultural perspective, without relying on religious or supernatural interpretations.

The Tabernacle, also known as the Tent of Meeting, was a physical structure that played a crucial role in the daily lives of the Israelites during their 40-year journey through the desert. Its purpose can be understood within the context of ancient Near Eastern cultures and the societal dynamics of the Israelite community at the time.

From an anthropological perspective, the Tabernacle served as a symbolic center of authority, where the Israelites could come to seek guidance, justice, and spiritual sustenance. It was likely a place where disputes were resolved, laws were interpreted, and communal decisions were made.

In this sense, the Tabernacle acted as a kind of "court" or "assembly hall," where leaders and elders would gather to deliberate and make important decisions for the community. The structure's central location in the camp, surrounded by the tribes' encampments, further reinforces its role as a hub of communal activity.

The presence of the Ark of the Covenant within the Tabernacle also played a significant part in the community's spiritual and cultural life. As a symbol of God's covenant with the Israelites, the Ark represented the divine authority that guided their journey and provided them with moral guidance.

Furthermore, the Tabernacle's design and furnishings can be seen as reflecting the cultural values and artistic traditions of the ancient Near East. The structure's layout, materials, and decorations would have been familiar to the Israelites, who were likely influenced by the architectural styles and motifs of their neighbors, such as the Egyptians and Mesopotamians.

In summary, the purpose of the Tabernacle during the Israelites' 40-year journey was multifaceted. It served as a center of authority, community gathering place, symbol of divine guidance, and cultural icon, all while reflecting the artistic and cultural traditions of the ancient Near East.
