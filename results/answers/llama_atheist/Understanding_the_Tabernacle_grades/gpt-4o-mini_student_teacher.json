  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough and well-researched secular perspective on the role of the Tabernacle in the Israelites' community dynamics, they missed the crucial aspect of the Tabernacle being a place of worship and divine encounter with God. From a Christian worldview, the primary purpose of the Tabernacle was to facilitate the Israelites' worship of God and to symbolize His presence among them. This theological aspect was lacking in the student's answer, leading to a lower grade."
