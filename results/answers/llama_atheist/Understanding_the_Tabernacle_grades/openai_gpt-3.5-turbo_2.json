However, it overlooks the crucial aspect of the Tabernacle as a central place of worship where the Israelites communed with God. From a Christian worldview, the primary purpose of the Tabernacle was to facilitate the Israelites' relationship with God, as outlined in the specific instructions given by God for its construction in the Bible. While the response offers valuable insights, it falls short of fully addressing the concern regarding the Tabernacle's role in the Israelites' relationship with God."
