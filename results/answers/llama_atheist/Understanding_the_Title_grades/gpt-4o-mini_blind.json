The answer does not acknowledge Jesus' divine nature and the implications of him using this title for himself as recorded in the Gospels. The analysis lacks doctrinal correctness when discussing Jesus' identity and misses the key point that in Christian belief, the title \"Son of Man\" points to both Jesus' humanity and divinity, as emphasized in the New Testament. A more comprehensive and accurate explanation of the significance of \"Son of Man\" in Christian theology is needed."
