  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough analysis of the title \"Son of Man\" from a cultural and historical perspective, but it falls short in addressing the specific concern of Jesus' self-identification and its implications for faith from a Christian worldview. The student's response does not delve into the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine, which is crucial in understanding the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in the context of Jesus' identity. It also lacks the perspective of Jesus as the Messiah and His unique connection to humanity. The student's analysis, while informative, misses the mark on providing a Christian-specific understanding of the importance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man'."
