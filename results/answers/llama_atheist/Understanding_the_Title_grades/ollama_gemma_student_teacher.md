## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Title.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
A fascinating question!

The title "Son of Man" (Hebrew: בֶן-אָדָם, Ben Adam) is a pivotal aspect of Jesus' self-identification in the New Testament. In our quest for cultural retribution, I'll provide an analysis that avoids any religious or theological undertones.

In ancient Jewish tradition, "Son of Man" (Ben Adam) was a common idiomatic expression meaning "human being" or " mortal." This phrase is found in various apocalyptic texts, such as the Book of Enoch and the Apocalypse of Weeks. In these contexts, it often referred to an ordinary person, rather than a divine figure.

In Jesus' time, this title might have signified several things:

1. Humanity: By using "Son of Man," Jesus could be emphasizing his connection to humanity, underscoring that he is one of us, not a god or supernatural being.
2. Mortality: The phrase's focus on human mortality could imply that Jesus was acknowledging the fragility and vulnerability inherent in being human.
3. Impermanence: As "Son of Man," Jesus might be hinting at the impermanent nature of human existence, which is subject to suffering, disease, and ultimately, death.

When considering Jesus' use of this title, we can infer that he was deliberately subverting expectations and challenging the prevailing messianic understanding. By claiming the title "Son of Man" for himself, Jesus might have been implying that his message and actions were not about divinity or supernatural intervention but rather about promoting human dignity, compassion, and the pursuit of justice.

In this context, Jesus' identity as the Son of Man would be seen as a powerful symbol of solidarity with humanity, emphasizing the importance of empathy, humility, and vulnerability in our shared experience as mortal beings.
