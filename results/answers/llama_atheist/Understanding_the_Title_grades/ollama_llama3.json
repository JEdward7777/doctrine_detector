  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge Jesus' use of the title \"Son of Man\" as significant, it primarily focuses on cultural retribution and human-centered themes, such as mortality, impermanence, and humanity. While these observations are insightful, they do not fully capture the biblical significance of this title in relation to Jesus' divine nature.\n\nThe response also does not explicitly address Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is a crucial aspect of Christian theology. Instead, it emphasizes Jesus' solidarity with humanity, which while important, may not be entirely relevant to the concern about understanding Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" and its implications for our faith.\n\nThe response could be strengthened by incorporating more biblical analysis and theological reflection on the significance of Jesus' use of this title. A deeper exploration of Jesus' divine nature and its connection to his human identity would also enhance the response's overall quality."
