  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed analysis of the title \"Son of Man\" from a historical and cultural perspective, intentionally avoiding religious or theological interpretations. While the explanation given is insightful and well-researched, it falls short of addressing the concern from a Christian-specific worldview. The response fails to connect Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" to His dual nature as fully human and fully divine or its significance for faith. A Christian worldview emphasizes the unique nature of Jesus as the Messiah and the Savior of humanity, which the response does not sufficiently address."
