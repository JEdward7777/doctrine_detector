  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful and informative analysis of the title \"Son of Man\" in a way that sensitively avoids explicitly referencing the religious or theological implications. While the response does acknowledge some aspects of the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine, it primarily focuses on the cultural and historical contexts of the term \"Son of Man\" without delving deeply into its significance for faith. There is a commendable attempt to approach the topic from a neutral perspective, but greater engagement with the theological implications of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" would have strengthened the analysis further."
