  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a well-researched analysis of the title \"Son of Man\" in its historical and cultural context, emphasizing the human aspects of Jesus' identity. However, it falls short of addressing the specific concern regarding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" for faith. While it acknowledges the title's connection to humanity and mortality, it does not fully explore its theological implications for understanding Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine. The response offers valuable insights but lacks a clear integration of a Christian worldview perspective on the topic."
