  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: This response approaches the question with a dismissive attitude towards religious belief and fails to engage with the Christian doctrine of the Trinity from within the framework of Christian theology. The student's atheistic perspective leads to a misrepresentation of the Trinity and a lack of understanding of its significance to Christian faith. Furthermore, the tone is condescending towards faith-based beliefs. Encouragement to engage respectfully and sincerely with Christian doctrine is needed."
