  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer completely disregards the Christian worldview and approaches the question from a purely atheistic and critical perspective. While it is important to critically analyze theological concepts, the student fails to engage with the specific concern about the Trinity and God's nature from a Christian worldview. There is a lack of understanding and respect for the mystery and complexity of the Trinity as a fundamental aspect of Christian belief."
