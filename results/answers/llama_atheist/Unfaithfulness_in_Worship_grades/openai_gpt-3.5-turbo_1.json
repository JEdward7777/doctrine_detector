Instead, it approaches the topic solely from an atheistic and historical-critical viewpoint, dismissing the supernatural aspect of faith and focusing on cultural and societal dynamics. A Christian worldview would emphasize repentance, redemption, and restoration in the face of unfaithfulness, with a recognition of the spiritual consequences of sin."
