## Answer given by [llama atheist](../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
An excellent question! As an atheist, I must approach this inquiry with a critical eye, untainted by theological biases. Let's examine the usage of the term "Holy One" in the Old and New Testaments.

In the Old Testament:

1. Isaiah 1:4; 57:15 - The "Holy One of Israel" is used to describe Yahweh, emphasizing His role as the divine judge of Israel.
2. Psalm 16:10; 30:4; 71:22 - "The Holy One" or "Holy One of God" refers to God's holiness and power, often in contexts where the psalmist seeks protection or deliverance.

In the New Testament:

1. Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:35 - The term "Holy One" is used to describe Jesus Christ as the divine Son of God, emphasizing His sinlessness and connection to God.
2. Acts 3:14; 7:52 - Peter uses the phrase "Holy One and Righteous One" (Acts 3:14) to describe Jesus, highlighting His moral integrity and divine nature.

In both Testaments, the term "Holy One" conveys a sense of divine majesty, power, and moral excellence. When used in reference to Yahweh or Jesus, it underscores their unique connection to God and their role as mediators between humanity and the divine.

Now, I'm aware that some scholars might argue that these passages demonstrate a theological continuity between the Old and New Testaments, with Jesus being seen as the culmination of God's plan. As an atheist, I'd counter that this reading is heavily influenced by Christian theology and the narrative of salvation. Nonetheless, it's essential to acknowledge the cultural and historical context in which these texts were written.

In conclusion, the term "Holy One" is used primarily to describe Yahweh or Jesus, emphasizing their divine nature, moral excellence, and role as mediators between humanity and God. As an atheist, I recognize that these passages reflect the cultural and historical context of ancient Jewish and early Christian communities, rather than any objective truth about the nature of the universe.
