  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments, correctly identifying its usage to describe Yahweh in the Old Testament and Jesus in the New Testament. However, the student's atheistic perspective led to a dismissive tone towards the theological significance of these passages, missing the opportunity to delve deeper into the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament. A more balanced approach that acknowledges and engages with the Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
