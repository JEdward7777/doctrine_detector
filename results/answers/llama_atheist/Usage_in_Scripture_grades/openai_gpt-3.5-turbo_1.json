However, the response lacks depth in exploring the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which was the specified concern. It does mention Jesus as the \"Holy One\" in the New Testament, but it does not delve deeply into his divinity and authority. Additionally, the atheist perspective presented could have been more critically analyzed in relation to the Christian worldview."
