However, the response lacks a clear assertion or analysis regarding the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which was the specified concern. While the response acknowledges Jesus as the \"Holy One,\" it does not delve deeply into his divinity or the implications of this title on his authority. Furthermore, the atheist perspective mentioned towards the end detracts from offering a comprehensive evaluation from a Christian worldview."
