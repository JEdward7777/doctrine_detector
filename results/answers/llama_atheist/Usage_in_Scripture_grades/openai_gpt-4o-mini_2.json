The connection between the authority and divinity of Jesus was well-explained through scriptural references. However, the atheistic worldview presented at the beginning and the emphasis on cultural and historical context rather than acknowledging the theological significance of Jesus' divinity could be seen as a limitation from a Christian worldview perspective."
