  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the significance of myrrh in ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean burial practices, particularly focusing on its antiseptic, aromatic, and symbolic qualities. The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of how myrrh was used in preparing dead bodies for burial and its cultural importance in anointing and showing respect to the deceased. The response also connects this information to biblical references, illustrating how recognizing customs surrounding burial practices can enhance our understanding of cultural contexts in scripture. However, to improve the grade, the student could have directly addressed the concern raised in the prompt and clearly emphasized how understanding these customs enhances comprehension of the cultural context in scripture."
