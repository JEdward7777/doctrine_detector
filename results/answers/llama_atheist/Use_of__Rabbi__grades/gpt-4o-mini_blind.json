The answer could be enhanced by emphasizing the doctrinal significance of Jesus being recognized as the ultimate Rabbi and teacher, surpassing all others in authority and wisdom. Additionally, connecting the use of the title \"Rabbi\" to the concept of Jesus as the ultimate spiritual guide and leader in Christianity would further strengthen the response."
