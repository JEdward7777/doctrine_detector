  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer discussing the significance of the title \"Rabbi\" in relation to both John the Baptist and Jesus. They correctly highlighted the respect and authority associated with the title and demonstrated an understanding of the roles of John and Jesus as teachers. The student could have improved their answer by referencing specific scriptural passages where Jesus and John were called \"Rabbi,\" similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
