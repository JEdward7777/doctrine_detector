It reduces the parables to mere secular allegories and symbolic representations, completely missing the spiritual and theological depth intended by Jesus. In analyzing the parables in such a manner, the student fails to acknowledge the core essence and significance of the Kingdom of God as described by Jesus. A proper understanding of the parables requires recognizing their divine origin and the spiritual truths they convey, which this analysis neglects."
