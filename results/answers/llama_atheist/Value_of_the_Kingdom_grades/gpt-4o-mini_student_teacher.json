  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough secular analysis of the parables used by Jesus to describe the Kingdom of God, they did not address the concern of appreciating the worth and significance of the Kingdom of God in our lives from a Christian worldview. The student's analysis focused more on the symbolic and metaphorical meanings of the parables rather than emphasizing the spiritual truths and eternal significance they convey. Encouragement to integrate a Christian perspective on the value of the Kingdom of God would have strengthened their answer."
