However, it lacks the acknowledgment of the spiritual significance and transformative power of the Kingdom of God in the lives of believers. It focuses solely on the symbolic and metaphorical meanings from a secular viewpoint without considering the deeper meaning of these parables in a Christian context. The response does not address the concern of appreciating the worth and significance of the kingdom of God in our lives from a Christian-specific worldview."
