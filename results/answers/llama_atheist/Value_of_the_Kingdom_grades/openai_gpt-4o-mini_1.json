However, it neglects to appreciate the worth and significance of the Kingdom of God in our lives from a Christian worldview perspective. As a Christian, it is essential to recognize the divinely ordained nature of the Kingdom of God and its profound impact on believers' lives, which goes beyond mere social movements or cultural shifts. The response could benefit from acknowledging and emphasizing the spiritual truths and eternal significance of the Kingdom of God in light of the Christian faith."
