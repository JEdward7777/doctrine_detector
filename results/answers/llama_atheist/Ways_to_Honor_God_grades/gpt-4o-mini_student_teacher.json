While these suggestions are relevant and valuable, they could have been more directly aligned with the reference answer, which emphasizes thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and living in a manner that showcases His greatness. Additionally, the student correctly acknowledged the specific Christian worldview context of their suggestions, which is important when discussing actionable expressions of faith and worship in everyday life."
