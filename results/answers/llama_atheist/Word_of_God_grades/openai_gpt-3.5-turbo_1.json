However, as an atheist scholar, there seems to be a lack of consideration or acknowledgment of the overarching Christian understanding that the Word of God encompasses not just messages found in scriptures and in Jesus, but that it ultimately represents God's divine communication to humanity for salvation and guidance. It would have been beneficial to address the significance of God's communication in relation to humanity's need for redemption and relationship with God, which is central to the Christian worldview."
