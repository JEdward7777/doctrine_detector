## Question [Worship Practices](../../../questions/Worship_Practices.md)
What are some modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God?

## Correct Answer
Modern idols can include material possessions, wealth, careers, or personal ambitions that take precedence over a relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
It's important for Christians to examine their lives and ensure that they are not prioritizing anything above their devotion to God.

## [Answer](../Worship_Practices.md) by [llama atheist](../../../answering_models/llama_atheist.md)
As an atheist, I must emphasize that all forms of idolatry are ultimately baseless and unfounded. However, since you asked for examples relevant to Christian thought, I'll provide some hypothetical scenarios where people might inadvertently substitute other things for God:

1. Social Media: In today's digital age, social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter can become idols in the sense that they consume our attention and energy. Some Christians might prioritize likes, followers, and online validation over their relationship with God.

Example: A young adult spends hours creating a perfect Instagram post to garner more likes and followers, sacrificing quality time with family and friends, and neglecting their spiritual growth.

2. Material Possessions: The pursuit of material wealth, luxury items, or status symbols can become idols for some Christians. They might prioritize accumulating possessions over cultivating their faith.

Example: A middle-aged professional becomes obsessed with buying the latest designer handbags, cars, or jewelry, neglecting their church attendance and spiritual practices in favor of material pursuits.

3. Self-Improvement: The pursuit of personal growth, self-actualization, or self-care can become an idol when it overshadows one's relationship with God. Some Christians might prioritize their own well-being over serving others and glorifying God.

Example: A young professional spends hours each day reading self-help books, attending seminars, and practicing mindfulness, but neglects their church community, volunteering, and spiritual growth.

4. Politics or Activism: In today's polarized society, some Christians might become so invested in political ideologies or social causes that they inadvertently prioritize these over their faith.

Example: A passionate Christian activist spends most of their time participating in protests, attending rallies, and engaging in online debates, neglecting their church attendance and spiritual practices in the process.

5. Family or Relationships: While family and relationships are essential to our well-being, some Christians might inadvertently idolize them when they become the sole focus of their lives.

Example: A devoted parent becomes so consumed with raising children that they neglect their own spiritual growth, marriage, and church involvement, sacrificing their relationship with God in the process.

6. Science or Technology: As scientific discoveries and technological advancements continue to shape our understanding of the world, some Christians might become so enamored with these pursuits that they prioritize them over their faith.

Example: A scientist becomes so consumed with researching a groundbreaking discovery that they neglect their church attendance, spiritual practices, and relationships with others.

7. Self-Expression or Creativity: The pursuit of artistic expression, creativity, or self-expression can become an idol when it overshadows one's relationship with God. Some Christians might prioritize their creative outlets over serving others and glorifying God.

Example: A talented musician spends most of their time composing music, performing, and recording albums, neglecting their church attendance, spiritual practices, and relationships with others.

These examples are not exhaustive, but they illustrate how easily other things can become idols in our lives. As Christians, it's essential to recognize these pitfalls and prioritize a genuine relationship with God above all else.
