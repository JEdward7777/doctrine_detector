  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched historical and cultural perspective on the concept of zeal in Christian teachings. However, they missed addressing the concern of understanding the biblical context of zeal, which is crucial for a believer's proper application in their life. While the answer was informative and insightful, the lack of emphasis on the biblical foundation of zeal impacts the overall grading."
