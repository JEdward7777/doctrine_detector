While it acknowledges the roots of zeal in Jewish Scripture and early Christian writings, it could have delved deeper into how these biblical foundations should inform a believer's understanding and practice of zeal in a contemporary Christian context. Additional emphasis on the importance of aligning one's zealous actions with biblical principles would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
