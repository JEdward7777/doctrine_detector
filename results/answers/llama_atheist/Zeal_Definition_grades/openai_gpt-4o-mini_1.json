The connection to Jewish Scripture and early Christian writers is well-explained. However, the response falls short in directly addressing the concern that understanding the biblical context of zeal is essential for proper application in a believer's life. While the explanation enhances understanding, a more explicit link to how this understanding impacts a believer's life would have been beneficial."
