However, the perspective presented, as an atheist scholar, lacks the necessary acknowledgment of the spiritual and religious significance that Mount Zion holds in Christian tradition. A more in-depth exploration of the theological implications and the fulfillment of God's covenant with David would be beneficial for a more well-rounded discussion."
