The inclusion of historical and cultural significance, along with the biblical account, is commendable. However, the perspective of the response being from an atheist scholar could lead to a lack of acknowledgement of the spiritual and theological aspects of Mount Zion's importance in Christian tradition. A stronger consideration of the scriptural significance from a Christian worldview would have enhanced the response."
