  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies that the \"abomination of desolation\" is a significant event during the end times, but it lacks the specific insight provided by the reference answer concerning its connection to rebellion against God and defilement of His place of worship. The student's response focuses primarily on the personal relationship with Jesus rather than the broader prophetic context."
