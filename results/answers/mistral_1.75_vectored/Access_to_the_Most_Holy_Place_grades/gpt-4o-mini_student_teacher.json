  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of the Holy of Holies in the Christian context and discussed the importance of purity in approaching God. However, the student's answer did not specifically mention that only the high priest was permitted to enter the 'most holy place' in order to maintain the holiness of God's presence and represent the people before God. This key detail is crucial in understanding the restriction and significance of access to the Holy of Holies."
