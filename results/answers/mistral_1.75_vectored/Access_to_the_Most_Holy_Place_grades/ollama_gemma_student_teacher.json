  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the importance of the restrictions on who could enter the Holy of Holies. They clearly explain the holiness of God and the need for purity and cleanliness. Additionally, the student's connection of the restriction to Jesus Christ's sacrifice is insightful and demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian theology. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific rituals and practices associated with the Holy of Holies."
