It effectively discusses the importance of recognizing the holiness of God and the required protocols for approaching Him. The response also ties in the concept of Jesus Christ's ultimate sacrifice and how it fulfilled the Old Testament requirements. Great job overall, with a clear connection to Christian beliefs and practices."
