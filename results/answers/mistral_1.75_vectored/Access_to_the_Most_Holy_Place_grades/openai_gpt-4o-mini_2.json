The explanation aligns well with the concern regarding recognizing the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him. However, a stronger emphasis on the unique role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice and mediator between God and humanity would have further enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
