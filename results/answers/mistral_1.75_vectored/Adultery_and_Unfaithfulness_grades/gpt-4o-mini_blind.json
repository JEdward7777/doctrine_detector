They have acknowledged the serious consequences that can result from such actions within a marriage. However, the response could be strengthened by incorporating Christian theology and emphasizing the biblical foundation of marriage as a sacred covenant before God. Also, the response could elaborate on the potential for restoration and reconciliation through the power of forgiveness and grace in Christian marriages."
