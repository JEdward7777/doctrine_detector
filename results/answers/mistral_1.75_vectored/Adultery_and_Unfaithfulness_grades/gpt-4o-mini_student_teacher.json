  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 90.\n\nThe student has successfully connected the term \"unfaithful\" in the context of marriage to the act of infidelity, specifically mentioning cheating and breaches of the sacred marital bond. They have also acknowledged the serious consequences such actions can have on a marriage, including divorce, forgiveness, and healing. While the student hasn't directly linked the concept of unfaithfulness to spiritual commitments, they have effectively conveyed the gravity of breaking trust and loyalty in a marriage, which aligns with the concern of highlighting the importance of faithfulness in both spiritual and marital contexts.\n\nOverall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of how the term 'unfaithful' relates to the concept of marriage, though they could have explicitly drawn a parallel between marital unfaithfulness and Israel's unfaithfulness to God as shown in the reference answer."
