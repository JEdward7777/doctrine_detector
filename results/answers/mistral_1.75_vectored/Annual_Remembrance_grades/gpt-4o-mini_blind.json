However, the mention of Passover as a time for Christians to remember Jesus' sacrifice, while true, does not fully capture the original purpose of the Passover celebration in the Old Testament context. It would have been more doctrinally accurate to delve deeper into the significance of the Passover in the context of the Old Covenant and its prophetic symbolism pointing towards Christ."
