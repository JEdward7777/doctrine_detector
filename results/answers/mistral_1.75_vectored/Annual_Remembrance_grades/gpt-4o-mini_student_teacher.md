Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a solid response by mentioning the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt as the reason for celebrating Passover. However, the integration of Christian faith and Jesus' sacrifice could have been more explicitly connected to the original purpose of Passover in the Old Testament. A stronger emphasis on the connection between Passover in the Old Testament and its significance in Christian faith could have improved the answer.
