Comment: The student has provided a solid explanation of the purpose of Passover in remembering God's victory over the Egyptians and the Israelites' deliverance from slavery. However, the response lacks a clear connection to the specified concern regarding the importance of remembrance in Christian faith. To improve the answer, the student could have explicitly connected the concept of remembrance in Passover to the Christian faith, highlighting the significance of remembering Jesus' sacrifice in relation to Passover.
