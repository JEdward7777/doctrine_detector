It also effectively connects anointing to the empowerment and presence of God's Spirit in believers' lives for service and guidance. While the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its exploration of the relationship between anointing and the empowerment of Christians through the Holy Spirit, it generally demonstrates a good understanding of this concept."
