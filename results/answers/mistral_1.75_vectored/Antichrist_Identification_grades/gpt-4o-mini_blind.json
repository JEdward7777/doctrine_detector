The definition of an antichrist according to 1 John 2:22 is someone who denies that Jesus is the Christ. The response provided lacks doctrinal accuracy and misinterprets the concept of antichrist. It is essential to accurately represent biblical teachings to avoid confusion and uphold the truth of Scripture."
