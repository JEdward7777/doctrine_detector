  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the significance of the apostles being sent by Jesus in spreading the gospel, emphasizing their role as witnesses, servants, symbols of unity and love, sources of guidance, and empowered by the Holy Spirit. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more directly on the specific concern of understanding the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission. The answer touches on various aspects of the apostles' mission but could have been more specifically linked to the Great Commission mentioned in the concern."
