  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the role of apostleship in the context of the Great Commission, but could be improved with more specific examples and details. The response accurately identifies the apostles' mission to spread the Gospel and fulfill the Great Commission, and highlights their importance as witnesses and servants of Jesus. It also notes the symbolic significance of the apostles as a reminder of unity and love among Christians.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from more specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate the apostles' role in spreading the Gospel and serving as witnesses to Jesus' teachings. Additionally, some sentences could be clarified for better understanding (e.g., \"They were called to serve as a reminder that we are all called to serve and love one another...\").\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good grasp of the concern, but could be further developed with more specific details and examples."
