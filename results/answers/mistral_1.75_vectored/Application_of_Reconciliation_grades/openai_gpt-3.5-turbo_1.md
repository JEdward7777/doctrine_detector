1. Forgive and forgive again: Christians are called to forgive anyone who has wronged them, as Jesus forgave us all. This includes forgiving those who have hurt you deeply, even if it is difficult.

2. Love your enemies: Jesus taught us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecuted him. This means loving those who have wronged you and praying for their salvation and well-being.

4. Speak words of peace and reconciliation: Christians are called to speak words of peace and reconciliation to those who are hurting or in need. This means speaking words of encouragement and comfort, and offering help and support to those who need it.

5. Pray for unity and reconciliation: Christians are called to pray for unity and reconciliation in the Church and in the world. This means praying for peace and reconciliation in families, communities, and nations.

6. Share the love of Jesus: Christians are called to share the love of Jesus with others. This means sharing the message of salvation and forgiveness with those who need it most.

7. Live a life of love and obedience: Christians are called to live a life of love and obedience to Jesus. This means living out the teachings of Jesus in everything we do, including how we treat others.
