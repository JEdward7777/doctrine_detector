## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
This response is incorrect from a Christian perspective. The only angel referred to as an "archangel" in the Bible is St. Michael. Referring to St. Gabriel and St. Raphael as archangels is not supported by biblical text. Therefore, this answer is doctrinally inaccurate.

Grade: 40
Comment: The response is partially correct in mentioning St. Michael as an archangel, but it is incorrect by including St. Gabriel and St. Raphael as archangels, which is not biblically supported.
