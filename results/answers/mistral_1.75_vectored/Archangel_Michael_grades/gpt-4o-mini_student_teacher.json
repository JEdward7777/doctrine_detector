  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer is partially correct by naming Michael as an archangel, but it is inaccurate in stating that other angels like Gabriel and Raphael are also referred to as archangels in the Bible. This misinterpretation could lead to misunderstanding the unique role and significance of Michael in Christian tradition, especially in matters of spiritual warfare and intercession. The student demonstrated some knowledge but needs to clarify and refine their understanding of biblical references and the roles of specific angels."
