## Grade: 70

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies that several angels are referred to as "archangels" in Christian tradition. However, it lacks precision as it lists three additional angels (St. Michael, St. Gabriel, and St. Raphael) who are not explicitly mentioned in the question or the given concern. While these angels are indeed significant in Christian belief, they are not the only ones referred to as "archangels" in the Bible. The response should have focused solely on Michael, as specified in the reference answer.
