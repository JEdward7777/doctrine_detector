  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe main issue with this response is that it partially contradicts the given answer, which states that Michael is the only archangel referred to in the Bible as such. The response being graded includes St. Gabriel and St. Raphael as archangels, which is not accurate according to the original answer. This mistake could potentially impact one's understanding of spiritual warfare and intercession, as recognizing Michael's unique position can be crucial for effective intercession.\n\nHowever, the response does acknowledge the significance of St. Michael, St. Gabriel, and St. Raphael in Christian tradition, which shows some level of understanding of their roles. Therefore, I give it a moderate score to reflect both the mistake and the partial accuracy."
