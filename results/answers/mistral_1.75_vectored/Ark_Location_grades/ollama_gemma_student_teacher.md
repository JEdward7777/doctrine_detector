The Ark of the Covenant was a sacred Christian symbol and part of the Holy Bible. It is believed to have been used as a symbol of the Lord's presence in the Old Testament. The exact location of the Ark of the Covenant in the Tabernacle is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed that it was placed in the Holy of Holies, which was the most holy part of the Tabernacle.
