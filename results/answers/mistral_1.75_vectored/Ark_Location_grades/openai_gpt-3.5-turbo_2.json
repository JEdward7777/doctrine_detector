  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies that the Ark of the Covenant was located in the most holy place, which is accurate from a Christian perspective. However, the response lacks depth in explaining the significance of the most holy place and the presence of God. To improve the grade, the response could have elaborated more on the concept of the Holy of Holies as the dwelling place of God's presence and the importance of this symbolism in Christian theology."
