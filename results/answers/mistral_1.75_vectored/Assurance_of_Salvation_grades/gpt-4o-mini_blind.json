However, it could have been strengthened by including more direct references to key Bible verses or doctrines supporting these promises. Additionally, the aspect of repentance and turning away from sin could have been highlighted more clearly as part of the assurance given to believers in Jesus. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper theological grounding."
