Believers are also called to serve others and to share the love of Jesus with others. This is a way to fulfill the Great Commission, which is to make disciples of Jesus to all nations.

In addition to these blessings, believers are also promised eternal life. This is a promise that is fulfilled through Jesus' sacrifice and His promise to come again to fulfill His promises.

Overall, believing in Jesus is a promise of love, forgiveness, and eternal life. It is a gift that is available to anyone who wants to receive it.
