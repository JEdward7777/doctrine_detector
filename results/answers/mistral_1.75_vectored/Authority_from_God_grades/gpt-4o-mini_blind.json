  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of divine authority as it pertains to Christian belief. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of the Bible as the primary source of divine authority and highlights the significance of divine authority in guiding a believer's life. The answer effectively conveys the idea that divine authority is meant to shape a Christian's actions, attitudes, and relationships in alignment with God's will. However, there could be more emphasis on the exclusivity and infallibility of the Bible as the Word of God, as well as the importance of obedience to divine authority in all areas of life. Strengthening these aspects would enhance the overall doctrinal correctness of the response."
