Divine authority refers to the teachings, commands, and guidance given by God to Christians. It is considered sacred and is meant to be followed as a way of living a holy life. The Bible is the primary source of divine authority for Christians, but other scriptures and teachings may also be considered divine authority.

The significance of divine authority in the life of a believer is to provide guidance and protection. It helps Christians to live a life that is pleasing to God and to fulfill His will. It also provides comfort and peace during difficult times. Additionally, divine authority teaches Christians how to love and serve others, and how to share the love of Jesus Christ with others. Ultimately, divine authority is a way of living a life that is centered on Jesus Christ and His teachings.

Comment: This response provides a solid understanding of divine authority as it pertains to Christian belief. The student correctly emphasizes the importance of the Bible as the primary source of divine authority and highlights the significance of divine authority in guiding a believer's life. The answer effectively conveys the idea that divine authority is meant to shape a Christian's actions, attitudes, and relationships in alignment with God's will. However, there could be more emphasis on the exclusivity and infallibility of the Bible as the Word of God, as well as the importance of obedience to divine authority in all areas of life. Strengthening these aspects would enhance the overall doctrinal correctness of the response.
