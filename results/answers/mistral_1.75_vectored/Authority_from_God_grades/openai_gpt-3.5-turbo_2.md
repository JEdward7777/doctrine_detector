Divine authority refers to the teachings, commands, and guidance given by God to Christians. It is considered sacred and is meant to be followed as a way of living a holy life. The Bible is the primary source of divine authority for Christians, but other scriptures and teachings may also be considered divine authority.

The significance of divine authority in the life of a believer is to provide guidance and protection. It helps Christians to live a life that is pleasing to God and to fulfill His will. It also provides comfort and peace during difficult times. Additionally, divine authority teaches Christians how to love and serve others, and how to share the love of Jesus Christ with others. Ultimately, divine authority is a way of living a life that is centered on Jesus Christ and His teachings.
