  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: The answer provided contains some biblical references, but there are significant inaccuracies and misunderstandings. The references to Colossians 3:4-5 and John 3:16 do not directly address the authority of governing rulers over their citizens. The student should have focused on passages like Romans 13:1-7, which explicitly discuss the authority of governing rulers as established by God. Additionally, the answer lacks clarity and coherence in connecting the passages cited to the topic at hand. Further development and alignment with relevant biblical teachings are needed for a higher grade."
