  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response contains some relevant scriptures and emphasizes the importance of rulers serving and protecting their citizens. However, the student should have directly cited Romans 13:1-2 regarding the authority of governing rulers, which is the key biblical passage addressing this topic. Additionally, the student's interpretation lacks depth and fails to fully address the concern of understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. More focus on the specific biblical principles related to governance and obedience would have strengthened the response."
