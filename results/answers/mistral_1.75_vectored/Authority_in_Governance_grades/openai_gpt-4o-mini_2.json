  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a strong basis in Scripture, specifically referencing Romans 13:1-2 to support the idea of governing rulers being established by God and possessing authority to govern. The student integrated the Christian worldview effectively by drawing upon Biblical teachings. However, there was some deviation from the original answer in the form of additional passages and interpretations, which slightly veered away from the specific concern of understanding God-ordained authority and obedience. Overall, a solid understanding and application of Christian principles were demonstrated in the response."
