## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The authority of the apostles is closely related to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. In the Bible, Jesus Christ commissioned his twelve apostles to go out and spread His message of love and salvification to all people. He also gave them the power to heal the sick, cast out demons, and forgive sins (Matthew 28:19-20). This authority was not just a physical gift but also a spiritual one that enabled them to speak and act in the name of Jesus Christ.

The apostles were also given the Holy Spirit to guide and empower them in their mission. Acts 7:15 says, "And the Holy Spirit will come upon you, and will fill you with the Holy Spirit, and will teach you what you ought to do." This promise was fulfilled when the apostles received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:38).

In addition to receiving the Holy Spirit, the apostles were also given the authority to make decisions and to discern what was right or wrong. For example, they were given the authority to decide who should be added to the early Christian church (Acts 2:46). They also had the authority to make decisions about how to handle disputes among Christians (Acts 2:39).

All of these blessings and gifts were given to the apostles so that they could fulfill their mission to spread the love and teachings of Jesus Christ to all people. Their authority to perform miracles and preach boldly was a reflection of their love for Jesus Christ and their desire to serve Him.
