  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a good job of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry. It accurately highlights the apostles' ability to perform miracles, preach boldly, and receive the Holy Spirit's guidance and empowerment. The passage also effectively connects these gifts to the apostles' mission to spread Jesus' message and teachings.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response could be more specific in its biblical references. While it mentions Matthew 28:19-20 and Acts 2:38, it could provide more direct quotes from Scripture to support its claims about the apostles' authority and empowerment. Additionally, the response could delve deeper into the implications of the apostles' divine authority for their ministry and the early Christian church.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively explores the concern of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry. With some additional support from Scripture and more in-depth analysis, it could be even stronger."
