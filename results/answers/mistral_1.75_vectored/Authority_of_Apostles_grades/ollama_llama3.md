## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The authority of the apostles is closely related to their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly. In the Bible, Jesus Christ commissioned his twelve apostles to go out and spread His message of love and salvification to all people. He also gave them the power to heal the sick, cast out demons, and forgive sins (Matthew 28:19-20). This authority was not just a physical gift but also a spiritual one that enabled them to speak and act in the name of Jesus Christ.

The apostles were also given the Holy Spirit to guide and empower them in their mission. Acts 7:15 says, "And the Holy Spirit will come upon you, and will fill you with the Holy Spirit, and will teach you what you ought to do." This promise was fulfilled when the apostles received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:38).

In addition to receiving the Holy Spirit, the apostles were also given the authority to make decisions and to discern what was right or wrong. For example, they were given the authority to decide who should be added to the early Christian church (Acts 2:46). They also had the authority to make decisions about how to handle disputes among Christians (Acts 2:39).

All of these blessings and gifts were given to the apostles so that they could fulfill their mission to spread the love and teachings of Jesus Christ to all people. Their authority to perform miracles and preach boldly was a reflection of their love for Jesus Christ and their desire to serve Him.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response does a good job of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry. It accurately highlights the apostles' ability to perform miracles, preach boldly, and receive the Holy Spirit's guidance and empowerment. The passage also effectively connects these gifts to the apostles' mission to spread Jesus' message and teachings.

However, I deduct a few points because the response could be more specific in its biblical references. While it mentions Matthew 28:19-20 and Acts 2:38, it could provide more direct quotes from Scripture to support its claims about the apostles' authority and empowerment. Additionally, the response could delve deeper into the implications of the apostles' divine authority for their ministry and the early Christian church.

Overall, this is a strong response that effectively explores the concern of exploring the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry. With some additional support from Scripture and more in-depth analysis, it could be even stronger.
