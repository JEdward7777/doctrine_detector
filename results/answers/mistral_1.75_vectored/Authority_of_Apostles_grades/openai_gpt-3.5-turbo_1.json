The inclusion of relevant biblical references further strengthens the explanation. However, a deeper discussion on the spiritual dimension of their authority and the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding and empowering them could provide a more comprehensive explanation. Overall, a strong response from a Christian worldview perspective."
