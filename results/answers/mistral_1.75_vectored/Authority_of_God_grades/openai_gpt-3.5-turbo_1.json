The explanation aligns well with the concern of deepening faith and trust in God's omnipotence. However, there could have been a clearer connection made to Jesus Christ specifically as the embodiment of Yahweh in the Christian faith. A bit more elaboration on how this understanding impacts Christian belief and practice would have strengthened the response further."
