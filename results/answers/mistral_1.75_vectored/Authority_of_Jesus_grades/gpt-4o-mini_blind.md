## [Answer](../Authority_of_Jesus.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The title "King of the Jews" is a reference to Jesus' role as the Messiah, who was sent to fulfill the promises of the Old Testament. This title also has deeper spiritual significance in the Christian faith. Jesus is seen as the King of the Church and the Savior of all people, not just those who were Jewish. He is also seen as the ultimate authority in all things, including the Holy Scriptures, which are considered sacred in Christianity. In this way, the title "King of the Jews" illustrates Jesus' authority over all creation, as he is the one who fulfilled the promises of the Old Testament and is the ultimate authority in all things.
