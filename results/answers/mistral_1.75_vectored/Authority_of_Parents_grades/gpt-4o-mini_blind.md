## [Answer](../Authority_of_Parents.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that parents are to love and serve their children, and to teach them to love and serve Jesus Christ. This includes teaching them to obey and honor their parents as well.

In Ephesians 6:7-8, it says: "Everything that I have commandment for you that I have said, that you should do; that the Holy Spirit may help you to fulfill what is greater than yourself. Love your servant the Lord Jesus Christ, and his servants the whole of the Christian people.

And in Colossians 3:10, it says: "And whatever you do, do it in love, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And the Lord will give you a blessing that will make you holy and will make you inherit a prayer that will be fulfilled.

In addition, the Bible also teaches that parents are to pray for their children and to bless them. In Luke 2:46-47, it says: "Jesus went with me to the Holy Spirit, and he became obedient to him. He was baptized with the Holy Spirit and was filled with the Holy Spirit.

And in Galatians 3:14, it says: "So that we might be blessed and obedied to the commandment that has been given to us.

These verses show that the Bible teaches that parents are to love and serve their children, and to teach them to love and serve Jesus Christ. They are also called to pray for their children and to bless them.
