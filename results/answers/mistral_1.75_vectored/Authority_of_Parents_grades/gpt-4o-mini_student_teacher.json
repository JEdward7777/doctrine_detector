  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some relevant Bible verses, but the focus is more on the parents' love and service towards their children rather than the authority parents hold over children based on the Biblical basis. The student did not directly address the issue of parental authority as emphasized in Ephesians 6:1-3. The answer could be improved by providing a more direct and explicit link between parental authority and the Biblical teachings mentioned."
