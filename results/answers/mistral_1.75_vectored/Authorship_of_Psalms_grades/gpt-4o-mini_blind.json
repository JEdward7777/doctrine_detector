Jesus Christ did not physically write the Psalms as they were composed in the Old Testament before His incarnation. The Psalms are traditionally attributed primarily to King David, with other authors including Asaph, the sons of Korah, Solomon, and other anonymous contributors. The Holy Spirit inspired the writing of the Psalms through these human authors. The statement about the apostles contributing to the Psalms is also inaccurate. The student did acknowledge that the early Christian church used the Psalms for worship and prayer, which is a positive point. The answer overall demonstrates some confusion regarding the authorship and inspiration of the Psalms."
