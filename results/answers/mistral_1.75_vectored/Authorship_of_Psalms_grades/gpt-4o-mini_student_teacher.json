  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some inaccuracies and lacks specificity in identifying the key figures involved in writing the Psalms. While they correctly mentioned David as one of the authors, attributing the writing of the Psalms to Jesus Christ and the apostles is not accurate within the traditional Christian understanding. The response also lacks clarity and coherence in connecting the key figures to the authorship of the Psalms. Additionally, the answer does not directly address the concern of recognizing authorship to enhance understanding of the Psalms' messages and themes. Overall, the response demonstrates a limited understanding of the topic and could benefit from more focused and accurate information."
