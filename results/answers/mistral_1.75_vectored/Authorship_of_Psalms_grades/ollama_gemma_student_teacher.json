However, it lacks specific mention of the traditional authors identified in the reference answer, such as King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph. While including Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit is commendable, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the role of these figures in the authorship of the Psalms. Additionally, the early Christian church and apostles' contributions could be elaborated on to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the Psalms' development."
