While these figures are significant authors of the Psalms, the omission of other key authors such as Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, as well as the role of the early Christian church and the apostles, lacks a comprehensive view of the Psalms' authorship. Recognizing the diverse authorship of the Psalms is crucial in understanding their messages and themes, as it showcases the multifaceted inspiration behind these scriptures. Additional depth and acknowledgment of the broader authorship would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
