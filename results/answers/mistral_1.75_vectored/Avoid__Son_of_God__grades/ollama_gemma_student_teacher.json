  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the cultural sensitivities surrounding the use of theological terminology. However, it lacks nuance and fails to adequately address the concern raised by the teacher. The student's suggestion of avoiding the term \"Son of God\" altogether may unintentionally perpetuate theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. A more appropriate approach would be to provide careful explanation and context to ensure that the intended meaning is conveyed respectfully and effectively to audiences from diverse religious backgrounds."
