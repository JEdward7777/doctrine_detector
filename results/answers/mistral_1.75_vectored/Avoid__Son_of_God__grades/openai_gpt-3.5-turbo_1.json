The suggestion to teach the meaning through context and explanation is valid and aligns with addressing the concern effectively from a Christian worldview. However, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing the unique and foundational Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the importance of accurately conveying this truth."
