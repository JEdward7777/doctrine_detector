  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response correctly emphasizes the importance of teaching the meaning of the term \"Son of God\" rather than avoiding it altogether, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the concern about theological gaps and misunderstandings is valid and should be considered in the approach of teaching this term in different cultural contexts. Overall, a strong response with a good understanding of the concerns raised."
