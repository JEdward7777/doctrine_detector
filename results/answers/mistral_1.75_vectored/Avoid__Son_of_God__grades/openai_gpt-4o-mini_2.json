  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a strong Christian perspective by emphasizing the importance of teaching and explaining the meaning of the term \"Son of God\" rather than avoiding it altogether. This approach aligns with Christian beliefs about the identity of Jesus and the significance of properly understanding His divinity. However, the grade is slightly lower due to the lack of emphasis on addressing potential theological gaps and misunderstandings that may arise if the term is avoided entirely."
