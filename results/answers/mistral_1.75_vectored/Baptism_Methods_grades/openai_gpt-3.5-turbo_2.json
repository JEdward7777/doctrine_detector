  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the various methods of baptism in Christianity, mentioning immersion, pouring, and sprinkling. However, it lacks specific references to biblical passages or denominational practices to further clarify the different interpretations and methods of baptism. Adding more detailed explanations and examples would enhance the response."
