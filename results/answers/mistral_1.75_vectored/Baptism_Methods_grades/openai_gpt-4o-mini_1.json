  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response only partially addresses the concern by mentioning immersion, pouring, and sprinkling as methods of baptism, but it fails to provide a comprehensive explanation of the different interpretations and methods of baptism in Christianity. The lengthy and irrelevant quotation from Acts detracts from the clarity and coherence of the response. Further elaboration and organization of the information would improve the grade."
