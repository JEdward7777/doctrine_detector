The student correctly identifies baptism as an act of obedience, a symbol of the washing away of sin, and a public declaration of faith in Jesus Christ. However, the answer could be improved by emphasizing more the aspect of baptism as a symbolic participation in Christ's death and resurrection, conveying the idea of dying to the old self and being raised to new life in Christ. Additionally, linking Acts 2:47 directly to baptism seems somewhat disconnected in this context. Overall, a solid foundational understanding is demonstrated, but deeper theological insights could enhance the answer."
