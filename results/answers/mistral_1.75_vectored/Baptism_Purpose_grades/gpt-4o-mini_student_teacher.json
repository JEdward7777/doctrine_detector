  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the significance of baptism in the life of a Christian according to New Testament teachings. They accurately highlighted baptism as an act of obedience, a symbol of spiritual cleansing and a new life in Christ, and a public declaration of faith. The references to Acts 2:47 and the importance of being filled with the Holy Spirit and loving one another deeply further support their answer. However, the student could have further emphasized the importance of being united with Christ through baptism, as mentioned in the reference answer."
