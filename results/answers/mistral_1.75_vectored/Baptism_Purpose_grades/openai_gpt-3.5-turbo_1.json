It appropriately emphasizes baptism as an act of obedience, declaration of faith, and incorporation into the body of Christ. It references biblical teachings on baptism and the importance of following Jesus. The response could be enhanced by providing more specific scriptural references to support the importance of baptism in the Christian faith."
