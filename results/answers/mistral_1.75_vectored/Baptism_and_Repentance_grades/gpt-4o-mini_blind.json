  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided does not directly address the relationship between repentance and baptism as presented in the New Testament. Instead, it seems to be a collection of random verses mentioning the Holy Spirit without a clear connection to the topic at hand. The answer lacks coherence, relevance, and a focused explanation on how repentance and baptism are related according to the New Testament. Further explanation and specific references to passages that illustrate the connection between repentance and baptism are necessary for a higher grade."
