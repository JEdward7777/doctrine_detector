  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response lacks a clear understanding of the relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine. While the student provided verses from the book of Acts, the content does not effectively discuss how repentance is related to baptism. The answer is mostly a repetition of verses without connecting them to the concept of repentance and baptism. The student needs to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the theological significance of repentance preceding baptism in order to receive a higher grade."
