  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response does acknowledge the relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine by stating that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism. However, the bulk of the response consists of Bible verses that seem to be copy-pasted without clear explanation or elaboration on how these verses specifically address the concern of the relationship between repentance and baptism. A more thorough analysis and explanation connecting the verses to the concern would have resulted in a higher grade."
