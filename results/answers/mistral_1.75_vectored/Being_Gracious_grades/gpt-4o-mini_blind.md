The term "gracious" means being kind, courteous, and respectful to others. It implies that we should always treat others with love and kindness, regardless of their background or circumstances. We should also be willing to forgive and help those in need, even if they have wronged us in some way. In addition, being gracious involves being humble and grateful for the blessings we receive in life.

85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this response as a 85. The student accurately defines the term "gracious" as being kind, courteous, and respectful to others. They also correctly mention the importance of treating others with love and kindness, forgiveness, and humility. However, to improve the grade, the student could have incorporated more explicitly Christian principles such as reflecting God's grace towards us in our interactions with others, or referencing biblical examples of gracious behavior. Incorporating these elements would have increased the depth and relevance of the answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
