  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: While the response provides some accurate information about the beliefs of the Pharisees, there are significant inaccuracies that detract from doctrinal correctness. The student incorrectly attributes beliefs about the Holy Spirit and Christian duties to the Pharisees, when these concepts are more aligned with Christianity rather than Pharisaic Judaism. Additionally, the response lacks detailed information on the Pharisees' specific beliefs about life after death and spiritual beings, focusing instead on broader Christian themes. Moving forward, the student should strive for greater precision and accuracy in connecting beliefs with their respective religious groups."
