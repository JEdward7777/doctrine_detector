  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the student's response provides some information about the beliefs of the Pharisees, it is not directly addressing the beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings as requested in the question. The answer focuses more on general beliefs and practices of the Pharisees rather than specifically addressing the beliefs in the afterlife and spiritual beings. In a Christian worldview, it is important to accurately convey the beliefs of the Pharisees in relation to these specific aspects for a deeper understanding of the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time.\n\nTherefore, the grade reflects the deviation from the question's focus and lack of specificity in addressing the beliefs about life after death and spiritual beings held by the Pharisees."
