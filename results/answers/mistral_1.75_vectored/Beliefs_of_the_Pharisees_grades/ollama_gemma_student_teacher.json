It accurately highlights their belief in judgement by God, eternal life for the righteous, and the importance of prayer for the dead. Additionally, the student correctly points out the Pharisees' belief in the Holy Spirit and their emphasis on virtue and biblical study.\n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific beliefs concerning angels and other spiritual beings. The reference answer suggests that the Pharisees held distinct beliefs in these entities compared to other Jewish groups. The student's response would be stronger by elaborating on these distinctive beliefs."
