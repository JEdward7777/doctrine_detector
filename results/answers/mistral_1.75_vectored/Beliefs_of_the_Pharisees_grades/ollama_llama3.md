Comment: The response provides some general information about the Pharisees' beliefs, but it does not adequately address the specified concern or directly answer the given question. While the response mentions that the Pharisees believed in life after death and spiritual beings, it does not distinguish them from other Jewish groups like the Sadducees as requested.

To better align with the concern and question, a more focused response could have highlighted specific teachings of the Pharisees regarding angels, spirits, or the afterlife, and how these beliefs differed from those of the Sadducees. The response also did not explicitly explore the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time as intended.

Future responses should strive to address the specified concern and question more directly while providing relevant details that support their claims.
