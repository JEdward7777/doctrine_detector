While the provided response gives some information about the Pharisees' beliefs, it does not specifically focus on how understanding these beliefs can shed light on the spiritual context during Jesus' time. The response could be improved by connecting the Pharisees' beliefs to the broader spiritual landscape of the time to better address the concern given."
