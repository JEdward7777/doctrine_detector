  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the Pharisees' beliefs and practices, but it does not directly address the specific concern provided. It lacks an exploration of how understanding the Pharisees' beliefs about angels and life after death enhances our understanding of the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time. A stronger connection between the provided answer and the concern would have improved the grade."
