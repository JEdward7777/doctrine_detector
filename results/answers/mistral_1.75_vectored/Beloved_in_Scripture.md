1. John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world that He gave His beloved Son, that whoever loves may have eternal life."
2. John 4:7 - "Jesus said, 'I am the Holy Spirit, sent to fulfill the commandments I have given you.'"

4. John 13:16 - "Jesus said, 'I will come to you again, if you love me, and I will be with you, and I will give you a new commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.'"
5. Galatians 6:9-10 - "Let us not become weary in doing good, let us always have the Holy Spirit with us, and let us pray that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit.

In these verses, Jesus refers to Himself as the Holy Spirit and commands His followers to love one another as He loves them. This is a reminder of the importance of love and compassion in the Christian life.
