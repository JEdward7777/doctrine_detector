  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the term \"beloved\" in the New Testament letters and its connection to Jesus' love for His followers. However, the answer lacks specific references to how the term is used within the Christian churches and the emphasis on love and unity among believers, as highlighted in the concern. The student also includes incorrect references to verses which do not contain the term \"beloved.\" Overall, while the student shows knowledge of the concept, there is room for improvement in addressing the specific concern."
