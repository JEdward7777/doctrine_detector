  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a basic understanding of the term \"beloved\" being used in the New Testament letters to address fellow believers with affection and unity. However, there are significant inaccuracies in referencing specific Bible verses and attributing statements incorrectly to Jesus (e.g., John 4:7 and John 5:16). The response also lacks depth in discussing the importance of love and unity among Christians as reflected in biblical teachings. Further development and accuracy are needed to improve the grade."
