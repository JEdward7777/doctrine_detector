Sharing "in Christ" is a phrase that refers to the Christian belief that Jesus Christ died for the salvation of all people and that those who accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior are now part of the Christian community. Here are some of the benefits of sharing in Christ:

1. Salvation: The most important benefit of sharing in Christ is salvation. Through Jesus, we can have forgiveness of our sins and eternal life.
2. Love and fellowship: When we share in Christ, we become part of the Christian community and are called to love and serve one another. This includes loving and serving others in the name of Jesus.
3. Spiritual growth: Sharing in Christ also means growing in faith and becoming more like Jesus. This involves reading the Bible, praying, and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit.
4. Protection: As Christians, we are protected by Jesus Christ. He is our Savior and our Lord, and He promises to protect us from sin and evil.
5. Joy and peace: Sharing in Christ brings joy and peace to our lives. We can have peace in the midst of trials and joy in the midst of suffering.
6. Mission and ministry: Sharing in Christ also means being called to share the good news of Jesus with others. This includes spreading the Gospel to those who have not heard it and serving others in the name of Jesus.
