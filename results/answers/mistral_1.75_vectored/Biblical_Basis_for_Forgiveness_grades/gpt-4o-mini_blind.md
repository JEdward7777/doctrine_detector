Grade: 20

Comment: The student provided the correct reference to Matthew 7:7-12, which does emphasize the importance of forgiveness. However, the student's response lacks clarity and coherence as the text provided appears to be a repetitive section, possibly due to copying error. Additionally, the response does not provide any other examples of Bible verses that emphasize forgiveness, which would have enriched the answer. The student should work on improving the organization and content of their response to receive a higher grade.
