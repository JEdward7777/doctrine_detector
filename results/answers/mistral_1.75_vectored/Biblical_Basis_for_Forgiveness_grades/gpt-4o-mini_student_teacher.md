## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response lacks coherence and clear understanding of the topic. The verse provided is lengthy, repetitive, and does not directly address the concern of forgiveness among believers. Improvement is needed in selecting relevant verses and presenting them cohesively.
