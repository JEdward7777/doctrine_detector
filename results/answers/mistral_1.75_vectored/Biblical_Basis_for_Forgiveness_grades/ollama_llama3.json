  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nComment: The response does not adequately address the concern of identifying scripture that supports the practice of forgiveness among believers. Instead, it provides an incomplete and repetitive quotation from Matthew 7:7-12 without any relevant biblical support or application to the topic of forgiveness. Furthermore, the response does not provide any connections between this verse and the concern at hand. The provided answer is more comprehensive and relevant, highlighting specific verses that emphasize the importance of forgiveness, making it a much stronger response."
