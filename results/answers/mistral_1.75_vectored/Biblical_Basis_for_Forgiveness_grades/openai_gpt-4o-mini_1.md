Grade: 50

Comment: The response correctly identifies key verses that support the practice of forgiveness among believers. However, the bulk of the response is a repeated text from Matthew 7:7-12 which does not add value to the answer and seems to be a copy-paste error. The student should have focused on elaborating more on why forgiveness is important based on the provided key verses.
