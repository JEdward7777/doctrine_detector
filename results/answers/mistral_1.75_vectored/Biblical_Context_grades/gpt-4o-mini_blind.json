  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a general understanding of the responsibilities of deacons found in various New Testament passages. However, there are inaccuracies in the verses provided. The verses referenced do not specifically outline the responsibilities of deacons, but rather focus on topics such as love, obedience, gifts of the Spirit, and devotion to Christ. The student's response lacks specific references to passages like 1 Timothy 3:8-13, which directly address the qualifications and responsibilities of deacons. More precise and relevant verses would improve the grade for this response."
