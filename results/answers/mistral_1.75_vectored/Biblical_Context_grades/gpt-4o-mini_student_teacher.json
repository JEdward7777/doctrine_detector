  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides some relevant verses about serving and loving others, praying, and being filled with the Holy Spirit, which are important aspects of a deacon's responsibilities. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as outlined in the reference answer. The focus on serving the apostles and the Lord Jesus Christ is relevant but does not fully align with the specific concern provided. The student could improve by incorporating specific verses or examples related to distributing resources fairly, especially to widows, as mentioned in the reference answer."
