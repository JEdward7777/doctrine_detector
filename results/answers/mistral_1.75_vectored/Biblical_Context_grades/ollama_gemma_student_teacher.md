## [Answer](../Biblical_Context.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The New Testament describes the responsibilities of deacons in several passages. Here are some key verses:

1 Corinthians 6:17-20: "Let us love and pray that we may be obedient to the Lord's commands, and that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit. Let us also pray for those who are entrusted to us to help and encourage them to do what is good and pleasing to the Lord. And let us pray for the Holy Spirit to come upon us to give us strength and peace and to guide us in our prayers and in our desires to serve the Lord.

2 Corinthians 3:16: "I am praying that you will always have a heart full of joy and love, and that you will always be obedient to Jesus Christ.

Ephesians 4:12: "And I want you to remember that God has given me a special gift to serve as a servant of Jesus Christ. I want to serve you and teach you about the Bible, and I want to pray for you and pray that the Holy Spirit will fill you with love and peace.

Acts 6:7: "The early Christians devoted themselves to the apostles and to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the Holy Spirit. They devoted themselves to the apostles and to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the Holy Spirit; and they devoted themselves to the apostles and to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the Holy Spirit.

These verses show that deacons were called to serve and love others, to pray for them, and to serve the Lord Jesus Christ. They were also called to serve the Holy Spirit and to be filled with the Holy Spirit. In addition, they were called to serve the apostles and to serve the Lord Jesus Christ.

The reference answer focuses on the distribution of resources, while the student's answer provides a more comprehensive understanding of the deacons' broader responsibilities.
