  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough response citing relevant verses regarding the responsibilities of deacons in the New Testament, emphasizing serving others, praying for them, and serving the Lord Jesus Christ. However, the response does not directly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as explicitly stated in the given answer. The student should have connected the responsibilities of deacons in distributing resources fairly, especially to widows, with the overall principle of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community. Integration of the given answer and concern could have strengthened the response significantly."
