  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the responsibilities of deacons as outlined in various New Testament passages. However, it lacks specific reference to the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, which was the specified focus. While the response touches on aspects of serving and loving others, it does not directly address the distribution of resources to widows as mentioned in the given answer. It would have been stronger if it connected the biblical responsibilities of deacons to the concern of fair treatment within the church community."
