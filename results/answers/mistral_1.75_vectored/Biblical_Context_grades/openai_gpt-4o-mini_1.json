  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided some relevant verses from the New Testament pertaining to the responsibilities of deacons, but it did not fully address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as specified in the answer. The response focused more on the general duties of deacons such as serving, loving others, praying, and being filled with the Holy Spirit, without specifically addressing the distribution of resources to widows. More direct and accurate connections to the specified concern would have improved the grade."
