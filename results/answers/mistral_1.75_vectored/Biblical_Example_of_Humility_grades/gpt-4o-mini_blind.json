  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student correctly identifies Jesus Christ as a prime example of humility in the Bible, emphasizing His obedience to God and sacrificial death. The reference to Philippians 2:1-3 is appropriate as it highlights Christ's humility. However, a further reference to specific instances from Jesus's life or teachings could enhance the answer further. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a foundational understanding of humility in the context of Christianity."
