One biblical example of a character who exemplified humility is Jesus Christ. He humbled himself and became obedient to God, even unto death (Philippians 2:1-3). He also taught his followers to love one another and to serve others as he served the Lord (Matthew 22:39-40).

Comment: The student correctly identifies Jesus Christ as a prime example of humility in the Bible, emphasizing His obedience to God and sacrificial death. The reference to Philippians 2:1-3 is appropriate as it highlights Christ's humility. However, a further reference to specific instances from Jesus's life or teachings could enhance the answer further. Overall, a solid response demonstrating a foundational understanding of humility in the context of Christianity.
