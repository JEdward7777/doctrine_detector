  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student correctly identified Jesus as an example of humility in the Bible, the concern was to provide tangible examples directly from the scriptures. The reference answer provided a specific biblical character, David, as an example of humility, which the student did not include in their response. Encouraging the student to reference specific biblical passages illustrating humility would enhance their answer."
