One biblical example of a character who exemplified humility is Jesus Christ. He humbled himself and became obedient to God, even unto death (Philippians 2:1-3). He also taught his followers to love one another and to serve others as he served the Lord (Matthew 22:39-40).

Grade: 50

Comment: While the student correctly identified Jesus as an example of humility in the Bible, the concern was to provide tangible examples directly from the scriptures. The reference answer provided a specific biblical character, David, as an example of humility, which the student did not include in their response. Encouraging the student to reference specific biblical passages illustrating humility would enhance their answer.
