## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
One biblical example of a character who exemplified humility is Jesus Christ. He humbled himself and became obedient to God, even unto death (Philippians 2:1-3). He also taught his followers to love one another and to serve others as he served the Lord (Matthew 22:39-40).

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response effectively provides a biblical example of humility, citing Jesus Christ as a model of humble obedience to God. The reference to Philippians 2:1-3 and Matthew 22:39-40 adds substance to the claim and demonstrates an understanding of scriptural examples of humility. Additionally, the response highlights Jesus' teaching on serving others, which is a key aspect of Christian humility.

However, while the response does mention David as an example of humility in the introduction, it does not further develop this example or provide any relevant biblical support. This omission reduces the grade, as the concern was specifically about finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. To receive a higher grade, the response could have more fully developed both Jesus' example and David's, providing a richer exploration of scriptural examples of humility.

Overall, while the response provides some excellent insights into biblical humility, it could be strengthened by further developing its examples and providing additional scriptural support.
