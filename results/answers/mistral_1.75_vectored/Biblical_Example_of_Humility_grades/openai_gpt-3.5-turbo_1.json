  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a valid example of a biblical character, David, who demonstrated humility and obedience to God. While David is indeed a biblical figure known for his humility, the response could have further strengthened the argument by including specific instances from David's life that showcase his humility. Additionally, connecting David's actions to specific biblical passages would have provided a more comprehensive analysis. Overall, the response demonstrates an understanding of humility in a Christian context, but could benefit from more depth and specificity."
