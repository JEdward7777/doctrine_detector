One biblical example of a character who exemplified humility is Jesus Christ. He humbled himself and became obedient to God, even unto death (Philippians 2:1-3). He also taught his followers to love one another and to serve others as he served the Lord (Matthew 22:39-40).

Grade: 50

Comment: While David is certainly a biblical character known for his righteousness and trust in God, the response does not directly address the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. The specific request was for examples of humility, and the response should have focused on individuals or instances that prominently displayed humility as a virtue. The mention of Jesus Christ in the first response aligns more closely with the concern stated.
