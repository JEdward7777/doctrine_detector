One biblical example of a character who exemplified humility is Jesus Christ. He humbled himself and became obedient to God, even unto death (Philippians 2:1-3). He also taught his followers to love one another and to serve others as he served the Lord (Matthew 22:39-40).

Grade: 60

Comment: While the response mentions David as a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God, the concern was specifically about finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures. The response would have been stronger if it directly referenced a biblical passage showcasing David's humility, or provided a more explicit explanation of how David's actions demonstrate humility according to a Christian worldview.
