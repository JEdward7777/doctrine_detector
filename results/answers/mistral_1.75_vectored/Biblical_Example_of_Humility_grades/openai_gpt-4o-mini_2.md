One biblical example of a character who exemplified humility is Jesus Christ. He humbled himself and became obedient to God, even unto death (Philippians 2:1-3). He also taught his followers to love one another and to serve others as he served the Lord (Matthew 22:39-40).

Comment: The response correctly identifies David as a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God, which is a good example of humility from the Scriptures. However, the response missed the opportunity to provide a more direct and widely recognized biblical example of humility, such as Jesus Christ, which would have strengthened the answer.
