  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided examples of biblical figures who were known for their blameless lives, the examples provided do not align with the specific biblical figures mentioned in the reference answer (Abraham and Noah). The student's response does emphasize the importance of learning lessons from the lives of blameless figures, but the lack of alignment with the specific examples given in the question detracts from the accuracy and relevance of the response."
