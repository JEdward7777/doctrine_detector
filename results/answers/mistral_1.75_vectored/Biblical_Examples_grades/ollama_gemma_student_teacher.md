**Grade:** 80/100

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately identifies several biblical figures who are cited as examples of being blameless and provides a brief explanation of their blamelessness. However, the response does not delve into the practical application of blamelessness in Christian lives as specified in the concern. Additionally, the student's answer does not include references to Abraham and Noah, who are mentioned in the reference answer.
