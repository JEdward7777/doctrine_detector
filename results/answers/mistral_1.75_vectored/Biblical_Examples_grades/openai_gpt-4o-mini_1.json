While the response does not directly address the specific concern regarding the practical application of blamelessness in Christians' lives, it does indirectly support the idea by showcasing how individuals like Jesus, Mary, Paul, Peter, and John the Baptist lived blameless lives. The response could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the examples to practical applications for Christians today."
