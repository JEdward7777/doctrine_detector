  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student correctly identified that the book of Genesis contains examples of God blessing creation. However, the student's interpretation of the verses provided is incorrect. Genesis 1:27 actually states \"So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.\" This verse speaks of God creating humanity in His image, not specifically blessing them. Genesis 2:3-4 discusses God blessing the seventh day and sanctifying it, not specifically blessing humanity as mentioned in the student's answer. The student should focus on accurately interpreting the biblical passages for a higher grade."
