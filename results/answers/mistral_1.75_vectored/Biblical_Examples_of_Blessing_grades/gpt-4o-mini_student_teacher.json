  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: The student correctly identified a biblical reference about God blessing creation but provided incorrect verses from Genesis. The verses provided do not accurately demonstrate how blessings are illustrated in scripture, as they are misinterpreted. The student showed effort in referencing the book of Genesis but needs to work on accurately quoting and applying biblical passages."
