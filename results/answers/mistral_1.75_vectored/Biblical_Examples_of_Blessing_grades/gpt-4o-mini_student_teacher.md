In Genesis 1:22, God blessed the creatures of the sea and the birds, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply.'

Knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Yes, one example is found in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:27, it says "So God blessed me and made me holy and gave me a command to love and obey Jesus Christ.

In addition, in Genesis 2:3-4, it says "And God blessed me and made me holy and gave me a command to love and obey Jesus Christ. And I will be with you always, until the end of time.

These verses show that God blesses us and makes us holy, and gives us a command to love and obey Jesus Christ.

Grade: 55

Comment: The student correctly identified a biblical reference about God blessing creation but provided incorrect verses from Genesis. The verses provided do not accurately demonstrate how blessings are illustrated in scripture, as they are misinterpreted. The student showed effort in referencing the book of Genesis but needs to work on accurately quoting and applying biblical passages.
