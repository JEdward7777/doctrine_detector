In Genesis 1:22, God blessed the creatures of the sea and the birds, saying, 'Be fruitful and multiply.'

Knowing how blessings are illustrated in scripture.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Yes, one example is found in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:27, it says "So God blessed me and made me holy and gave me a command to love and obey Jesus Christ.

In addition, in Genesis 2:3-4, it says "And God blessed me and made me holy and gave me a command to love and obey Jesus Christ. And I will be with you always, until the end of time.

These verses show that God blesses us and makes us holy, and gives us a command to love and obey Jesus Christ.

Grade: 50

Comment: The response providing examples from Genesis 1:27 and Genesis 2:3-4 is incorrect and misinterprets the verses. The given answer from Genesis 1:22 is more accurate in illustrating how blessings are portrayed in scripture. However, the response did not adequately address the concern and misapplied the verses referenced.
