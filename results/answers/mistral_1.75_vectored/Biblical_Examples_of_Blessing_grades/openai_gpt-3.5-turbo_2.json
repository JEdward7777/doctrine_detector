  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response is inaccurate as it misquotes scripture by attributing phrases such as \"So God blessed me and made me holy...\" and \"And I will be with you always, until the end of time\" to verses from Genesis. The given answer in Genesis 1:22 is correct in demonstrating how blessings are illustrated in scripture, but the response does not accurately reflect this biblical context. It is important to accurately quote and reference scripture when discussing theological concepts."
