## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Blessing.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Yes, one example is found in the book of Genesis. In Genesis 1:27, it says "So God blessed me and made me holy and gave me a command to love and obey Jesus Christ.

In addition, in Genesis 2:3-4, it says "And God blessed me and made me holy and gave me a command to love and obey Jesus Christ. And I will be with you always, until the end of time.

These verses show that God blesses us and makes us holy, and gives us a command to love and obey Jesus Christ.
