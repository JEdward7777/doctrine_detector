  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided does not accurately address the concern about how blessings are illustrated in scripture. The verses cited from Genesis 1:27 and 2:3-4 are incorrect and misinterpreted, as they do not reflect the concept of God blessing creatures in the same way as the given example. The response lacks understanding of scriptural context and misrepresents the Biblical teachings on blessings."
