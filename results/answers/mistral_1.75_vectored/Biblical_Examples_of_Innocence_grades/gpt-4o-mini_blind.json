  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: \n\n1. The student has made some attempts to provide examples from Scripture regarding Jesus' innocence, but there are several inaccuracies in their references. For example, the quotes mentioned are not found in the specified verses in the Bible. It is essential to provide accurate biblical references to support claims when discussing theological topics.\n2. The student's interpretation of Jesus' innocence and purity is somewhat shallow and could benefit from a deeper analysis of the theological significance behind these aspects of Jesus' character.\n3. The answer lacks depth and could be improved by expanding on the theological implications of Jesus' innocence in relation to his role as the sacrificial Lamb of God. \n4. Encourage the student to study the Scriptures more carefully and to seek a deeper understanding of the theological concepts they are discussing to provide a more accurate and insightful response."
