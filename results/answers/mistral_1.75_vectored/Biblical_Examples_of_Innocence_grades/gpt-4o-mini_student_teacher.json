  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student's response is well-intentioned but lacks accuracy in providing specific examples from Scripture that clearly illustrate Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. The examples provided do not directly address the concern raised, and some of the references provided are misquoted or taken out of context. The student should focus on accurately referencing relevant passages that align with the specified concern to improve their answer."
