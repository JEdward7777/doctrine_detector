  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides relevant examples from the Bible that affirm Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations, aligning well with the concern. However, the response could have included more examples or further elaborated on the presented examples to strengthen the argument. Overall, a solid effort in applying a Christian worldview to the evaluation of Jesus' innocence."
