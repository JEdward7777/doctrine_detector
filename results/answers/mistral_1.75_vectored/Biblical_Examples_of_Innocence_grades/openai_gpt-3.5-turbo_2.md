## Question [Biblical Examples of Innocence](../../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md)
Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

## Stated Concern
These examples serve to elucidate key moments in the New Testament that affirm the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Innocence.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Yes, I can. Here are some examples:

1. Jesus is called "the Holy One" in the Bible (Matthew 26:39). This shows that Jesus was innocent and pure.

2. Jesus also said, "I am innocent according to the Holy Spirit" (Luke 24:39). This shows that Jesus saw himself as innocent and pure.

3. When Jesus was accused by the Phariseans, he responded with love and forgiveness. He said, "Love your enemies, just as I love you" (Matthew 7:7). This shows that Jesus' love and forgiveness were a reflection of his innocence and purity.

4. Jesus also said, "Blessed are those who meek and humble, for they will be blessed and fulfilled" (Matthew 5:8). This shows that Jesus wanted to bless and fulfill those who were meek and humble, which is a reflection of his innocence and purity.

5. Jesus also said, "I am the Lamb of God, who comes to fulfill the commandment of love (John 15:7). This shows that Jesus saw himself as a symbol of love and purity.

These are just a few examples of how Jesus' innocence and purity are reflected in the Bible.

Comment: The response provides relevant examples from the Bible that affirm Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations, aligning well with the concern. However, the response could have included more examples or further elaborated on the presented examples to strengthen the argument. Overall, a solid effort in applying a Christian worldview to the evaluation of Jesus' innocence.
