  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provided some relevant examples from the New Testament that affirm Jesus' innocence in the face of false accusations. However, the additional examples given in the graded response focused more on Jesus' purity and love, which are related but not directly addressing the concern of innocence in the context of false accusations. The examples provided in the graded response did not directly correlate with the concern given, leading to a slightly lower grade."
