  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85. The student effectively provided additional examples from the Bible that highlight Jesus' innocence and purity, showing a good understanding of how these concepts are portrayed in Christian beliefs. The examples cited are relevant and align well with the concern provided. Some minor improvements could include referencing specific verses for each point and further elaborating on how these examples support the Christian understanding of Jesus' innocence. Overall, a strong and thoughtful response."
