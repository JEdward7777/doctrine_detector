Yes, there are many Biblical figures who expressed lament. Here are some of them and the lessons we can learn from their examples:

1. Jesus Christ - Jesus expressed lament in the Bible several times, including when He was preparing for His mission to fulfill the Scriptures (Luke 22:39-46). We can learn that Jesus' example of humility and obedience is a great reminder to us to always put others before ourselves and to serve others with love and compassion.

2. Mary - Mary, the mother of Jesus, also expressed lament in the Bible. She lamented and prayed for her beloved son during the time of His ministry (Luke 2:8-10). We can learn that Mary's example of faith and obedience is a great reminder to us to trust in God's plan and to have faith in His promises.

3. Peter - Peter, one of Jesus' disciples, also expressed lament in the Bible. He lamented and prayed for Jesus during the time of His trial (Matthew 26:39). We can learn that Peter's example of prayer and repentance is a great reminder to us to always seek forgiveness and guidance from God.

4. Paul - Paul, another disciple of Jesus, also expressed lament in the Bible. He lamented and prayed for his fellow believers (Ephesians 3:17). We can learn that Paul's example of love and compassion is a great reminder to us to always care for others and to pray for those in need.

5. John the Baptist - John the Baptist also expressed lament in the Bible. He lamented and prayed for Jesus during the time of His ministry (John 16:39). We can learn that John's example of love and obedience is a great reminder to us to always follow Jesus and to be a servant of His love.

These are just a few examples of how the Bible teaches us to express lament and how we can learn from these examples.

Comment: The answer provides a good list of Biblical figures who expressed lament and briefly mentions the lessons that can be learned from their examples. However, it lacks depth in explaining the specific aspects of lament that each figure expressed and how those can be applied in our lives today. Further elaboration on the nature of lament, the emotions involved, and the ultimate trust in God's sovereignty would enhance the answer. Additionally, citing specific verses for each Biblical figure's lament would strengthen the response.
