  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided good examples from the Bible that illustrate the concept of mercy and showed an understanding of how these stories teach about mercy. However, there was a lack of depth in real-life applications of mercy, which could have enhanced the answer further. Encouraging the student to connect the Biblical examples to modern-day situations or personal anecdotes could have strengthened the response."
