  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided excellent examples of mercy drawn from biblical stories and teachings, effectively enhancing understanding through scriptural references. While it could have included a bit more detail or explanation about each example to further deepen the analysis and connect it to real-life applications, overall, it effectively addressed the concern. The examples chosen were appropriate and supported the theme of mercy well."
