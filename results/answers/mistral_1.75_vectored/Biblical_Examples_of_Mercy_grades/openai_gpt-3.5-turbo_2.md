## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Mercy.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible is full of stories and teachings about mercy. Here are some key examples:

1. Jesus' parable of the Merciful Lord (Matthew 7:13-14): Jesus teaches us to pray for forgiveness and to be merciful to others as He is merciful to us.

2. The story of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:1-17): This story teaches us about the love and mercy of God, who welcomes back a repentant sinner who has returned to Him.

3. The story of the Samaritan who helps a wounded Christian (Luke 10:29-37): This story teaches us about the importance of loving our neighbors and showing mercy to those in need.

4. The story of the woman caught in adultery (John 8:1-12): Jesus shows mercy and forgiveness to this woman, even though she was caught in a serious sin.

5. The story of the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13): Jesus teaches us to pray for forgiveness and to forgive others, as He forgives us.

These are just a few examples of how the Bible teaches us about the importance of mercy.
