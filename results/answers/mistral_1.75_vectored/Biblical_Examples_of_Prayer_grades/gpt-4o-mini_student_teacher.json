  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples from the Bible illustrating the power and importance of prayer. However, some of the examples given were not directly related to the concern of fostering a stronger prayer life. It would have been more beneficial if the student had focused on stories that specifically highlight how prayer can deepen one's relationship with God and enhance their prayer life. The examples provided could have been more closely tied to the reference answer given by the teacher."
