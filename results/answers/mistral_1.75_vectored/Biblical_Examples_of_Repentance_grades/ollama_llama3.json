  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a good job of providing biblical examples that demonstrate repentance, including Peter's story, the Prodigal Son, and an example from the book of Acts. The writer effectively shows how these stories illustrate the concept of repentance and its importance in Christian life. However, the response could be improved by more directly addressing the concern about learning from biblical examples and applying it to one's own life.\n\nThe provided answer is mentioned, but not fully engaged with or built upon in this response. The writer could have taken the given examples as a starting point and explored how they can be applied to daily life, making the concept of repentance more practical and relatable for readers. Nevertheless, this response demonstrates a good understanding of biblical teachings on repentance and its significance in Christian living.\n\nComment: This response is strong in providing biblical examples, but could benefit from more explicit discussion of how these examples can be applied to one's own life."
