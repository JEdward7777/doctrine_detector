## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Transgression.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible has many references that illustrate the concept of transgression. Here are some examples:

1. Matthew 7:7-8: "And whoever wants to become like Jesus Christ must love me deeply and obey me and be baptized with the Holy Spirit and receive a new commandment to love one another, as I have loved you. And whoever loves me will be blessed and fulfilled. I am fulfilling this commandment to you now.

2. John 3:16: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever loves him would be saved."

3. Galatians 5:7: "Let us love one another, for love comes from the Holy Spirit.

4. Colossians 3:10: "And do whatever commands come to you that I may help you to fulfill my commandment to love and pray and serve the Lord our Savior Jesus Christ.

5. Ephesians 2:7-8: "He made me holy and shepherd and servant of the Lord, which is very humble. He made me obedient to the commandments of Jesus Christ.

6. 1 Corinthians 2:7: "And if anyone does anything in love, it is done in the Holy Spirit.

7. 1 Corinthians 13:13: "I will always pray for you and will always pray that you will be filled with the Holy Spirit and will be able to help me to fulfill the commandment to love and pray and serve the Lord our Savior Jesus Christ.

These verses are just a few examples of how the Bible teaches us to love and serve others, and to forgive and forgive those who have wronged us.
