  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer does not correctly address the concept of transgression as outlined in the teacher's reference answer. The verses provided by the student focus more on themes of love, obedience, and service rather than specifically on transgressing against God's commands. The student should have focused on verses that highlight disobeying or going against God's laws to align with the concern provided."
