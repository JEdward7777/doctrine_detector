While the verses emphasize the importance of love, obedience, and forgiveness, they do not directly tie into the idea of learning from past transgressions in order to avoid making similar mistakes. Incorporating examples like 1 Thessalonians 4:6, Daniel 9:24-25, and Psalm 32:1 would have better addressed the concern given."
