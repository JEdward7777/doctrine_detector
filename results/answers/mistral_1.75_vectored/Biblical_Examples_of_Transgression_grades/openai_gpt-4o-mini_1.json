While the provided Bible verses emphasize love, obedience, and serving others, they do not directly relate to the concept of transgression and learning from past mistakes. It lacks depth and relevant examples needed to fulfill the concern effectively. Additional analysis and application of specific instances of transgression from the Bible would have strengthened the response."
