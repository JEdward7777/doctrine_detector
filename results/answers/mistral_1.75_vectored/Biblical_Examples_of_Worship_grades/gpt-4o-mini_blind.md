## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response incoherently and repetitively presents a mixture of poetic language and random phrases unrelated to the topic of worship contrasted with idol worship. The content does not accurately address the question regarding a specific example from the Bible. The answer lacks clarity, coherence, and doctrinal correctness. It is essential for the student to focus on providing relevant and accurate biblical references in their responses to earn a higher grade.
