  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response correctly identifies an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship. However, the student's response could be improved by providing more context and analysis of the passage. Additionally, the student's response does not explicitly connect the concept of idolatry with Christian beliefs or values."
