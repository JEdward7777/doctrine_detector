20.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 20.

Comment: This response falls short because it doesn't address the concern about avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. Instead, it repeats the same phrase multiple times without providing any meaningful connection to the original passage or the concern being addressed. The repeated mention of Jesus' love and the Holy Spirit's presence is not relevant to the concern of idolatry. To address the concern effectively, the response should provide a biblical example that illustrates the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship, such as Exodus 20:3.
