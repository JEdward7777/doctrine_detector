  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided in the answer is clear and directly addresses the concern of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship. However, the response in the student's submission is completely unrelated to the given answer and concern. The quoted text from the book of Revelation does not provide an example of avoiding idolatry or remaining faithful to God's commands. Furthermore, the repetition in the response indicates a lack of coherence and understanding of the topic. More focus and relevance to the given answer and concern are necessary for a higher grade."
