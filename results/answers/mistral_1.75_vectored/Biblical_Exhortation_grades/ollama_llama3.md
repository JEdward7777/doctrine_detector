Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately identifies the key aspect of Jesus' directive to his apostles, which is to spread the good news about salvation through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin. However, it could be more explicit about the importance of evangelism in the Christian faith, as instructed by the concern. The added details about making disciples, baptizing, and teaching new followers would have further solidified the response's alignment with the correct answer. Nevertheless, the response effectively conveys the essence of the Great Commission, earning a high grade.
