The reference to Jesus as 'King of the Jews' in the Bible is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. In the Old Testament, Jesus is referred to as the Messiah, who would come to save and redeem the people of Israel. One of the most important prophets in the Old Testament was Jesus' namesake, Jesus Christ. He was called Jesus because he was sent to fulfill the prophets and to be a Savior for all people.

In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is referred to as the King of the Jews, which is a fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 2:1-5, which says: "And I will make him holy and will be with him, and will give him the Holy Spirit that will be with him. And I will be with you, and I will be with you, and I will be with you. I will be with you. Amen." This verse is fulfilled in the Holy Spirit that came upon Jesus at his baptism, and it also fulfilled the promise to be with Jesus until the end.

Another prophecy that was fulfilled in Jesus is found in Isaiah 9:7, which says: "And a child will be born to me, and a son will be given to me. And he will be called Jesus, and he will be called Jesus, and he will be called Jesus. And he will be called Jesus.

In addition to these specific prophecies, Jesus is also referred to as the King of the Jews, which is a fulfillment of the broader prophetic message of the Old Testament. Jesus is seen as the fulfillment of the promises made in the Old Testament, and he is called the King of the Jews because he is the Son of God, who came to save and redee
