  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the connection between Jesus being called 'King of the Jews' and Old Testament prophecies, especially in referencing specific verses like Isaiah 2:1-5 and Isaiah 9:7. However, there were some inaccuracies in the student's response, such as stating that Jesus was a prophet in the Old Testament and some confusion in the explanation. The student could have expanded more on the significance of Jesus being from David's line and establishing an everlasting kingdom, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, the student's understanding is decent, but there is room for improvement in clarity and accuracy."
