The response jumps between different prophecies without fully connecting them to the concept of Jesus as the King of the Jews. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the significance of recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment in Christian theology. More clarity and focus on the connection between Jesus as the fulfillment of these prophecies and the importance for Christian beliefs would strengthen the response."
