The student accurately connects the title to the prophecy of the Messiah coming from David's line and establishing an everlasting kingdom. However, the response could have further highlighted the significance of this fulfillment for Christian theology, emphasizing the importance of recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment in shaping the core beliefs of Christianity. Additionally, there were some minor inaccuracies in the explanations provided."
