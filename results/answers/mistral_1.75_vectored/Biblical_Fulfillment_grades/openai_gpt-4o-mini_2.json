  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of how the title \"King of the Jews\" for Jesus is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah from David's line. The student accurately connects the title with biblical prophecy and demonstrates an understanding of its importance in Christian theology. However, the response could be improved by refining the structure and coherence of the explanation, as some parts feel repetitive and disjointed."
