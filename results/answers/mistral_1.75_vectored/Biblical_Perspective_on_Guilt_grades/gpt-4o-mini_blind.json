  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general overview of how the Bible illustrates the consequences of guilt and sin. However, the response lacks depth and specific examples from Scripture to support each point. Additionally, some points are repeated, which shows a lack of clarity and organization in the answer. Encouragement to provide more specific biblical references and delve deeper into the consequences of guilt and sin would enhance the quality of the response."
