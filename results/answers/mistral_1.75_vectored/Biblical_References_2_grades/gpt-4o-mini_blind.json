The verses referenced focus more on aspects like prayer, being filled with the Holy Spirit, love, and service rather than specifically showcasing God's majesty. Additionally, the verses are misquoted and misapplied within a Christian theological context. It is important to accurately connect the verses to the concept being discussed and maintain doctrinal accuracy when referencing biblical passages."
