2. Colossians 3:10 (NIV): And this is the prayer of the Lord Jesus that we have received for you:

3. Ephesians 6:7 (NIV): And above all these prayers, we pray that you will always be filled with the Holy Spirit, and that you will be able to help and encourage one another in your prayers.

4. Philippians 4:7 (NIV): And the peace of the Lord Jesus Christ will be with you, and the Holy Spirit will fill you and give you peace.

Comment: The answer provided does not correctly address the question regarding Bible verses illustrating the concept of God's majesty. The verses referenced focus more on aspects like prayer, being filled with the Holy Spirit, love, and service rather than specifically showcasing God's majesty. Additionally, the verses are misquoted and misapplied within a Christian theological context. It is important to accurately connect the verses to the concept being discussed and maintain doctrinal accuracy when referencing biblical passages.
