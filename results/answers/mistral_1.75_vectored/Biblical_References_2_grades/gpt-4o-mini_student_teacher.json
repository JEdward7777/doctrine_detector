  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer does not effectively connect the provided Bible verses with the concept of God's majestic nature. The verses they chose primarily focus on the Holy Spirit, prayer, and love, rather than specifically illustrating God's majesty. The student should have focused on verses like those in the reference answer that directly highlight God's greatness, power, and majesty."
