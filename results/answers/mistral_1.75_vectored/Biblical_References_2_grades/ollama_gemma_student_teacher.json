  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately identifies several biblical passages that relate to the concept of God's majesty. However, the selection of verses could benefit from a deeper connection to the concern of understanding God's majestic nature. The student's response focuses primarily on the role of the Holy Spirit in personal transformation rather than explicitly addressing the concept of God's majesty as a divine attribute. The inclusion of verses that explicitly speak to God's majestic power and sovereignty would strengthen the overall response."
