The Bible has many verses that illustrate the concept of God's majesty. Here are some examples:

1. Psalm 24:7-8 (NIV): "Jesus is Lord, and I am praying for you to be filled with the Holy Spirit, that you may love me deeply and fulfill my commandments. Jesus is Lord.

2. Colossians 3:10 (NIV): And this is the prayer of the Lord Jesus that we have received for you:

3. Ephesians 6:7 (NIV): And above all these prayers, we pray that you will always be filled with the Holy Spirit, and that you will be able to help and encourage one another in your prayers.

4. Philippians 4:7 (NIV): And the peace of the Lord Jesus Christ will be with you, and the Holy Spirit will fill you and give you peace.

5. Galatians 5:22 (NIV): But I want to remind you that the Holy Spirit has given us a gift to help us love and serve others.

6. Acts 2:47 (NIV): And they devoted themselves to the apostles and to the fellow believers and to the Lord and to the Holy Spirit.

7. John 16:7 (NIV): Jesus said, “I am going to make you holy, and I will give you a new commandment that I will teach you, and I will send the Holy Spirit to help you.”

These verses show how Jesus wants us to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to love and serve others. They also remind us of the importance of prayer and the Holy Spirit's role in our lives.

**Grade: 75/100**

**Comments:**

The student's answer adequately identifies several biblical passages that relate to the concept of God's majesty. However, the selection of verses could benefit from a deeper connection to the concern of understanding God's majestic nature. The student's response focuses primarily on the role of the Holy Spirit in personal transformation rather than explicitly addressing the concept of God's majesty as a divine attribute. The inclusion of verses that explicitly speak to God's majestic power and sovereignty would strengthen the overall response.
