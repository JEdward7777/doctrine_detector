  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response provides a collection of Bible verses that illustrate God's majesty, but it does not explicitly connect these scriptures with the concept of God's majestic nature as requested. While some of the verses mentioned do reference the Holy Spirit and prayer, which are relevant to the concern, the connection between the scripture and the understanding of God's majestic nature is not made clear.\n\nA more direct connection between the scripture and the understanding of God's majestic nature would be necessary to fully address the concern."
