  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides additional Bible verses that relate to aspects of the Christian faith, it does not directly address the concern of connecting scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature as outlined in the exemplary answer. The verses mentioned in the response focus more on the Holy Spirit and prayer rather than specifically on God's majesty. The student displayed some knowledge of Christian teachings, but there is a need for greater alignment with the specific concern provided."
