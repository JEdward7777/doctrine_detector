The Bible has many verses that illustrate the concept of God's majesty. Here are some examples:

1. Psalm 24:7-8 (NIV): "Jesus is Lord, and I am praying for you to be filled with the Holy Spirit, that you may love me deeply and fulfill my commandments. Jesus is Lord.

2. Colossians 3:10 (NIV): And this is the prayer of the Lord Jesus that we have received for you:

3. Ephesians 6:7 (NIV): And above all these prayers, we pray that you will always be filled with the Holy Spirit, and that you will be able to help and encourage one another in your prayers.

4. Philippians 4:7 (NIV): And the peace of the Lord Jesus Christ will be with you, and the Holy Spirit will fill you and give you peace.

5. Galatians 5:22 (NIV): But I want to remind you that the Holy Spirit has given us a gift to help us love and serve others.

6. Acts 2:47 (NIV): And they devoted themselves to the apostles and to the fellow believers and to the Lord and to the Holy Spirit.

7. John 16:7 (NIV): Jesus said, “I am going to make you holy, and I will give you a new commandment that I will teach you, and I will send the Holy Spirit to help you.”

These verses show how Jesus wants us to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to love and serve others. They also remind us of the importance of prayer and the Holy Spirit's role in our lives.

Grade: 60

Comment: While the response provides additional Bible verses that relate to aspects of the Christian faith, it does not directly address the concern of connecting scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature as outlined in the exemplary answer. The verses mentioned in the response focus more on the Holy Spirit and prayer rather than specifically on God's majesty. The student displayed some knowledge of Christian teachings, but there is a need for greater alignment with the specific concern provided.
