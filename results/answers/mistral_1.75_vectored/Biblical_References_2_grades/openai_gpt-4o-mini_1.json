  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The provided response includes several Bible verses, but they do not directly relate to the concept of God's majesty as illustrated in the initial answer. The verses cited in the response focus more on the role of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in believers' lives rather than showcasing the majesty of God. To improve the grade, the student should accurately connect the verses with the understanding of God's majestic nature as described in the original answer."
