  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: \n\nThe student's response contains a mixture of accurate and inaccurate information. While they have attempted to reference Old Testament passages such as Isaiah 52:7-10 and Psalm 22, the interpretations provided are not accurate. The references to Matthew 26:42 and Luke 22:36 are from the New Testament and do not contribute to the understanding of the \"Son of Man\" in the Old Testament context. Additionally, the interpretation of the verses provided is unclear and not in line with traditional Christian teachings on the \"Son of Man\" as the coming Messiah. The student should aim to improve their understanding of the biblical references and present a clearer and doctrinally sound explanation."
