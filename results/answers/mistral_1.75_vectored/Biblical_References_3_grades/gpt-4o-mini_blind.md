The "Son of Man" is a key figure in the Bible and has many references in the Old Testament. Here are some of the most important references that contribute to the understanding of the Son of Man as the coming Messiah:

1. Isaiah 52:7-10: This passage speaks of Jesus Christ as the Son of God who will come to save His people. It says, "I am deeply loved by the Lord, and I am greatly loved by the Lord. He is my salvation, and I am sent to be a servant to love and serve others. I am a servant of the Lord, and I am blessed and humbly obedient. I am sent to be a servant to love and serve others. I am a servant of the Lord, and I am blessed and humbly obedient."

2. Psalm 22:36: This passage speaks of Jesus Christ as the Son of God who will come to fulfill the prophets. It says, "And I will make you holy and will help you to love me, and I will give you the Holy Spirit. I will send you to be a servant to love and serve others. I will bless you and make you holy, and I will send you to be a servant to love and serve others. I will bless you and make you holy, and I will send you to be a servant to love and serve others. I will bless you and make you holy, and I will send you to be a servant to love and serve others."

3. Matthew 26:42: This passage speaks of Jesus Christ as the Son of God who will come to fulfill the prophets. It says, "I have come to fulfill the Scriptures that were written about me. I am fulfilling the prophets. I am fulfilling the prophets. I am fulfilling the prophets."

4. Luke 22:36: This passage speaks of Jesus Christ as the Son of God who will come to fulfill the prophets. It says, "I am fulfilling the Scriptures that were written about me. I am fulfilling the prophets. I am fulfilling the prophets. I am fulfilling the prophets."

These verses show that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who will come to fulfill the prophets and serve His people. They also show that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who will come to fulfill the prophets and serve His people.

Comments: 

The student's response contains a mixture of accurate and inaccurate information. While they have attempted to reference Old Testament passages such as Isaiah 52:7-10 and Psalm 22, the interpretations provided are not accurate. The references to Matthew 26:42 and Luke 22:36 are from the New Testament and do not contribute to the understanding of the "Son of Man" in the Old Testament context. Additionally, the interpretation of the verses provided is unclear and not in line with traditional Christian teachings on the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah. The student should aim to improve their understanding of the biblical references and present a clearer and doctrinally sound explanation.
