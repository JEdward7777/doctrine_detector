The references given do not directly address the 'Son of Man' as the coming Messiah. The student should focus on utilizing texts like Daniel 7:14 that clearly link the 'Son of Man' to the messianic role as specified in the concern. The student needs to improve their understanding of how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic identity."
