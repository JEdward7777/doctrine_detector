The response primarily focuses on reproducing verses rather than analyzing their connection to the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role.\n\nThe provided answer is not directly addressed in this response, which is a missed opportunity to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic. Additionally, the response could have benefited from more nuanced analysis and explanation of how these Old Testament references inform our understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\" in the New Testament.\n\nTo improve, the response could have included a more thoughtful exploration of how these Old Testament references shape our understanding of Jesus' identity and mission as the \"Son of Man.\""
