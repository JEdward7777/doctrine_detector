  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides relevant references from the Old Testament that contribute to the understanding of the Son of Man as the coming Messiah, but it lacks depth in connecting these references to the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the Son of Man. There is repetition in the provided verses and the commentary does not sufficiently address how these Old Testament passages inform the New Testament perspective. Additional analysis and insights would have strengthened the response."
