  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The response provided does not effectively explore how the Old Testament informs the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\" The passages referenced do not align with the concern given, and the interpretations presented lack cohesiveness and accuracy in connecting the Old Testament to the New Testament concept of the Son of Man. More precise and relevant scriptural analysis is needed to effectively address the concern."
