  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response lacks depth and accuracy in connecting the Old Testament references to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the \"Son of Man.\" While it mentions some relevant verses, it does not effectively show how these verses inform the messianic role of Jesus. More analysis and explanation linking both the Old and New Testaments would strengthen the response. Additionally, there are instances of repetition and inconsistencies in the selected passages presented in the answer, which detract from the clarity and cohesiveness of the overall argument."
