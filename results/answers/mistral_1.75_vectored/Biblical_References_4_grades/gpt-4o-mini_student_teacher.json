The passages they cited do not directly illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God as explicitly requested. There is a misunderstanding or confusion with the concept being asked. The student needs to focus on accurately selecting relevant biblical passages that specifically highlight the use of 'Lord' in reference to God to demonstrate a deeper understanding of God's authority and importance as the true Lord."
