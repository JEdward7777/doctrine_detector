  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided some verses where \"Lord\" is used to refer to Jesus Christ, but there are inaccuracies in the interpretation and presentation of the verses. The verses provided do not directly support the idea that \"Lord\" references the authority and divinity of God. Additionally, some of the verses given in the response are not coherent or relevant to the topic at hand. There is room for improvement in accurately identifying and explaining biblical references to reinforce the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord."
