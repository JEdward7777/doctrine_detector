  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComments: The response correctly identifies the connection between unleavened bread and Christian teachings, referencing the Last Supper as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew. The mention of using unleavened bread as a symbol of Jesus' sacrifice and love is accurate. However, the answer could be improved by mentioning the specific verse where the connection between unleavened bread and Christian teachings is explicitly made, such as Matthew 26:26. Additionally, discussing the broader significance of unleavened bread in Christian tradition could enhance the depth of the response."
