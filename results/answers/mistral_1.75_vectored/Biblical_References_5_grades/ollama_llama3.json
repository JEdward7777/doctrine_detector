  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response does mention unleavened bread in relation to Christian teachings, it fails to accurately identify the specific biblical text that connects this concept to Christian practices. The correct answer is 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, which is not mentioned in the original response. Additionally, while the passage from Matthew 26:39-42 is relevant, it does not directly discuss unleavened bread as a symbol of Jesus' sacrifice and love for us.\n\nTo receive a higher grade, the response could have provided more accurate biblical references and elaborated on how these texts relate to Christian practices."
