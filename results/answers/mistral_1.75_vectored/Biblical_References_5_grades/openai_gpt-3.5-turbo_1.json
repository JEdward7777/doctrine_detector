This demonstrates a solid understanding of biblical texts that provide insight into Christian practices. However, the passage from the Gospel of Matthew also effectively connects unleavened bread to Christian teachings in the context of Holy Communion and Jesus' sacrifice and love. By incorporating both passages, the response could have showcased a more comprehensive understanding of the biblical foundation supporting the use of unleavened bread in Christian practices."
