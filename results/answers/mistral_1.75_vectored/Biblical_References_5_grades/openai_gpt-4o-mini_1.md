## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The New Testament scripture that connects the concept of unleavened bread to Christian teachings is the Bible's Gospel of Matthew, specifically Matthew 26:39-42. In this passage, Jesus teaches his followers to remember and celebrate the Holy Communion (also known as the Lord's Supper) in a way that symbolizes His sacrifice and love for us. He commands them to do this until He comes again, and to remember that he will always be with us. This includes using unleavened bread as a symbol of Jesus' sacrifice and love for us.
