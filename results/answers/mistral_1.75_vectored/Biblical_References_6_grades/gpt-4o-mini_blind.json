  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided a list of Bible verses, but most of them are off-topic and do not directly address the concept of resurrection. The verses quoted speak more generally about faith, God's love, obedience to Jesus, etc., rather than specifically addressing the doctrine of resurrection. Additionally, the repetition of the same verses multiple times at the end of the response is unnecessary and adds confusion. To improve the grade, the student should focus on selecting verses that directly relate to the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the promise of resurrection for believers in Him."
