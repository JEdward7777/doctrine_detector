  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the response does provide some relevant Bible verses, it primarily focuses on a single topic (resurrection) rather than addressing the concern of grounding beliefs and teachings in authoritative Christian texts. The verses listed are not necessarily directly related to the original answer provided, which discusses resurrection and eternal life more broadly. Additionally, the repetition of Revelation 22:1-7 is unnecessary and takes up a significant amount of space without adding meaningful content.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide a clearer connection between the Bible verses listed and the original concern of grounding beliefs and teachings in authoritative Christian texts."
