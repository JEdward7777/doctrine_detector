However, the verses provided are disjointed and not directly relevant to the concept of resurrection. Additionally, the response lacks coherence and clarity in addressing the concern of focusing on scripture for authoritative Christian teachings. In the future, it would be beneficial to provide a more focused and organized explanation using relevant verses to address the specific concern."
