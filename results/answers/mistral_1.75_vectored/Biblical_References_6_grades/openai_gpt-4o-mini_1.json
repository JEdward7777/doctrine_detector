  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided includes a mix of Bible verses, but the majority of them are not relevant to the concept of resurrection. The verses are also not accurately quoted or interpreted in relation to resurrection and eternal life. Additionally, the response lacks a clear and focused discussion on the topic of resurrection in line with the provided answer and the concern of grounding beliefs in authoritative Christian texts. More focus on relevant verses and accurate interpretation would significantly improve the grade."
