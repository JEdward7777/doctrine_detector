  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided multiple Bible references, but the majority of them do not directly address the significance of the Sabbath. The references mentioned seem to be taken out of context and do not specifically relate to the observance of the Sabbath and its importance in Christian faith. Additionally, the student included repetitive content in the answer, which could have been more concise and focused on relevant scripture passages. It is important for the student to carefully select and accurately interpret Bible verses that directly address the given concern."
