The majority of the references provided are repetitive and do not address the concern of identifying scriptural backing for the Sabbath observance and its relevance in Christian faith. Additionally, some of the references are out of context or appear to be copied and pasted without proper understanding. A more thoughtful and contextual approach to presenting scriptural evidence would be beneficial."
