  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student provided some verses, but there are several inaccuracies in their explanations. The references provided do not accurately address the concept of ransom. Additionally, the interpretations are far from the correct theological understanding of redemption through the ransom paid by Jesus Christ. The student's explanation lacks depth and coherence with Christian doctrine. More research and understanding of the biblical concept of ransom and redemption are needed."
