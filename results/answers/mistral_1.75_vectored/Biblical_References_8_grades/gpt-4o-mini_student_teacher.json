  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer shows an attempt to provide verses related to ransom and redemption, but there are multiple inaccuracies in the verses quoted. The verses given do not directly speak to the concept of ransom or redemption, and the interpretations provided lack coherence with the biblical foundation of redemption. There is a lack of depth and accuracy in connecting the verses to the theology of redemption. The student should focus on selecting relevant verses and providing accurate interpretations in future responses."
