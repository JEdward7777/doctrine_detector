## [Answer](../Biblical_References_8.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible has many verses that reference the concept of ransalment. Here are some examples:

1. Matthew 26:39 - Jesus said, "I will be with you always, until I come to fulfill this commandment to love you, which is greater than life, that I may love you and that I may love you more deeply.

2. Ephesians 2:7-8 - And He made us holy and gave Himself to us to be holy and holy, and He loves us because He loved Him.

3. Galatians 3:13 - So we have been made a new commandment, that we love one another, and we have fulfilled this commandment.

4. John 3:16 - For God so loved the world that He gave His Holy Spirit to those who obedied to Him and became Christians.

These verses show that Jesus came to redeem us from our sins and make us holy. He did this by loving us unconditionally and giving himself to us. This love and sacrifice is what makes us holy and enables us to love others in the same way. The Bible teaches us that we are called to love one another and to share this love with others. This is the ultimate goal of the Christian life.
