However, there is a mix-up with the term \"ransalment\" instead of redemption. The explanation and interpretation of the verses could be more detailed and focused on the theology of redemption, linking them directly to the process of salvation and deliverance through God's initiative. The response demonstrates a foundational understanding of the concept but lacks depth in exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption."
