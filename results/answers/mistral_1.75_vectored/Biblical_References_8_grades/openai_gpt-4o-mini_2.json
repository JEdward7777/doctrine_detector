  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided several Bible verses that touch on the concept of redemption, there are areas of improvement. The verses cited in the response did not directly address the theology of redemption and ransalment (ransom) in a clear and accurate manner. The interpretations given in their response were somewhat inaccurate and lacked depth in explaining the theological significance of redemption. The student demonstrated an effort to reference relevant verses, but the response fell short in fully exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption in comparison to the provided answer."
