The references to Matthew 22:37-40, Ephesians 6:7, Galatians 6:9-10, Colossians 3:13-14, and Revelation 22:17 are not directly addressing covenant faithfulness. Additionally, Psalm 23:1 is incorrectly referenced as Psalm 22:36. The student could improve by selecting verses that specifically speak to the theme of covenant faithfulness, providing accurate references, and explaining how each verse relates to the concept. There is room for improvement in aligning the verses more closely to the topic at hand."
