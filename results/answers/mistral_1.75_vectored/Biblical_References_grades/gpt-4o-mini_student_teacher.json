  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 20/100.\n\nThe student listed several Bible verses, but most of them do not directly relate to the concept of covenant faithfulness. While some verses mention love, obedience, and blessings, they do not specifically address the covenantal relationship between God and His people. Additionally, the student did not provide an explanation or analysis connecting these verses to the understanding of covenant faithfulness as requested. The response lacks depth and relevance to the question posed. Going forward, the student should focus on selecting verses that directly pertain to the concept of covenant faithfulness and provide a clear explanation tying them together."
