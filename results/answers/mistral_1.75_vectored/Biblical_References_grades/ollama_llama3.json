  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While this response provides numerous Bible verses related to covenant faithfulness, it does not specifically address the concern of connecting scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness. The provided references are more focused on demonstrating the concept's biblical basis rather than explicitly exploring its implications or applications. To improve, the response could provide a clearer explanation of how these verses illustrate covenant faithfulness and how this understanding can be applied in daily life.\n\nNote: A higher grade would require the response to not only provide relevant scripture but also demonstrate a clear connection between the scriptural examples and the concept of covenant faithfulness."
