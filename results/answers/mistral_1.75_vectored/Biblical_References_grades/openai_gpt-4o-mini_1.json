  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a decent list of Bible verses related to covenant faithfulness, but it did not directly address the concern of connecting scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness. Additionally, some of the verses quoted in the response are not directly related to covenant faithfulness, which may lead to a lower grade. However, the effort in providing relevant verses is appreciated."
