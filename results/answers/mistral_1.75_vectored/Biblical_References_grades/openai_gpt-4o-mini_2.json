  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a list of Bible verses related to covenant faithfulness, but most of the verses do not directly address the concept of covenant faithfulness. While the effort to provide relevant verses is appreciated, the lack of direct connection to the concept of covenant faithfulness diminishes the effectiveness of the response. Adding more precise explanations on how each verse relates to covenant faithfulness would significantly improve the grade."
