  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical passages and their significance for understanding the inclusion of Gentiles in the Christian faith. The student correctly identifies the apostolic mission to Gentiles and emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus rather than adherence to the law for justification. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the implications of these passages for the broader understanding of Christian inclusivity and the role of the Gospel in reaching people from diverse backgrounds."
