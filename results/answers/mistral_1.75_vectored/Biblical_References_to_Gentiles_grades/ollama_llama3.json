  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does acknowledge that Jesus' love and mission extend to Gentiles, it primarily focuses on highlighting the apostolic mission to Gentiles rather than delving deeper into the biblical teachings on grace and inclusion as encouraged by the concern. The response also lacks specific exploration of how these passages demonstrate faith in Jesus justifying Gentiles before God, which is a key aspect of the answer.\n\nThe response does partially address the concern by mentioning that Jesus' love and mission extended to Gentiles, but it could have explored this idea further and more explicitly connected it to the teachings on grace and inclusion. To improve, the response could provide more biblical evidence and analysis to support its claims about Jesus' inclusive love and mission.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates some understanding of the passages, but it could be strengthened by providing a more in-depth exploration of the scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion."
