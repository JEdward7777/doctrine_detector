  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights the apostolic mission to Gentiles and emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus for justification. The connections made to Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 support the given answer on grace and inclusion within a Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to provide more direct quotations or references from the passages to strengthen the argument. Overall, a strong understanding and application of scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion."
