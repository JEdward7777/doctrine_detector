## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Gentiles.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Acts 9:13-16 reveals that Jesus sent his followers to share the message of salvification to all people, including Gentiles. In this passage, Jesus sends his disciples to the Gentile believers who were persecuting the early Christians. This shows that Jesus' love and mission was not limited to the Jewish people but also extended to Gentiles.

Galatians 2:16 reveals that Jesus came to fulfill the commandment to love and serve all people, including Gentiles. In this passage, Paul writes that he is fulfilling the commandment to love and serve all people, including Gentiles, by serving Christ. This shows that Jesus' love and mission was not limited to the Jewish people but also extended to Gentiles.

Both Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 show that Jesus' love and mission was not limited to the Jewish people but also extended to Gentiles. They also show that Jesus' love and mission was based on His commandment to love and serve all people.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response effectively incorporates the specified passages from Acts and Galatians to emphasize the early Christian mission to the Gentiles and the importance of faith in Jesus for justification. The connection between grace and inclusion in the scriptural teachings is well articulated. However, there could be a deeper exploration of how these passages specifically reflect Jesus' overarching message of love and inclusivity towards all people, in line with His commandment to love and serve others. Further elaboration on the significance of Jesus' love being extended to Gentiles as a demonstration of His universal grace would enhance the overall understanding from a Christian worldview.
