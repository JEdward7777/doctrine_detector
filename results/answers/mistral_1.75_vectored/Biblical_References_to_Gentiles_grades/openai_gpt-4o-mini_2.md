## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Gentiles.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Acts 9:13-16 reveals that Jesus sent his followers to share the message of salvification to all people, including Gentiles. In this passage, Jesus sends his disciples to the Gentile believers who were persecuting the early Christians. This shows that Jesus' love and mission was not limited to the Jewish people but also extended to Gentiles.

Galatians 2:16 reveals that Jesus came to fulfill the commandment to love and serve all people, including Gentiles. In this passage, Paul writes that he is fulfilling the commandment to love and serve all people, including Gentiles, by serving Christ. This shows that Jesus' love and mission was not limited to the Jewish people but also extended to Gentiles.

Both Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16 show that Jesus' love and mission was not limited to the Jewish people but also extended to Gentiles. They also show that Jesus' love and mission was based on His commandment to love and serve all people.
