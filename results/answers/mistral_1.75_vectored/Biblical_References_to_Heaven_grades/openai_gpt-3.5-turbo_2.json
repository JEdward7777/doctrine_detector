While the verses may relate to the concept of heaven, they are not properly integrated or elaborated upon. The response lacks depth in connecting the verses to the concern of understanding God's kingdom and the realities of heaven. Incorporating some interpretation or reflection on the verses would have significantly enhanced the response."
