  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided contains verses that do not actually pertain to the concept of heaven but rather speak of being made holy and loving God. While these are important aspects, they do not directly address the concern of exploring references about heaven to understand God's kingdom and the physical and spiritual realities associated with it. Therefore, the grade is low as the verses provided do not align with the specified concern."
