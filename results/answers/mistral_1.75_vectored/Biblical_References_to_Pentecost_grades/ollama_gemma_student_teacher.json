  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the scriptural references related to the Festival of Weeks. It provides specific citations from both the Old and New Testaments to support their claims. However, the answer would be more comprehensive if it included references to other relevant biblical passages mentioned in the reference answer, such as 2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, and Numbers."
