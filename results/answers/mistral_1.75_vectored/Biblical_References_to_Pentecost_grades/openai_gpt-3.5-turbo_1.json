  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response provides some accurate information about the references to the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) in the Bible, there are some inaccuracies and missing details. The response correctly identifies Acts as containing a reference to Pentecost but incorrectly includes 2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, and Numbers as containing references (which they do not). Additionally, the response could have elaborated more on the significance and observance of Pentecost based on the provided scriptures. Overall, there is a mix of accurate and inaccurate information presented."
