  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a list of books that contain references to the Festival of Weeks but did not specifically address the concern raised regarding the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost. The response also inaccurately attributed references to the Festival of Weeks in the Bible. The student demonstrated some knowledge of the topic but did not directly answer the concern given."
