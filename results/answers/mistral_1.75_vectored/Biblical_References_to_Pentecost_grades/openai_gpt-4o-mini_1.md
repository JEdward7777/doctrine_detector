Grade: 40

Comment: The response provided some correct books referencing the Festival of Weeks (Feast of Pentecost), including Acts which does mention the observance of Pentecost. However, the given response missed key references like Leviticus which provide detailed instructions on how to observe the feast. Additionally, the response did not adequately explain the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost, falling short of a thorough understanding from a Christian worldview.
