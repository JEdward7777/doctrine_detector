  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response shows a good effort in summarizing the passages from 1 Timothy and 2 Peter, recognizing Jesus as a servant, guide, and source of strength. However, the student's answer lacks a clear connection to the central theme of Christ as Savior delivering believers from sin and providing eternal life, which is the main focus of the concern. Encouraging the student to deepen their understanding of the salvific nature of Christ based on the scriptural foundations would enhance their response."
