  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 30.\n\nWhile the student does quote biblical passages, they fail to address the concern of understanding scriptural foundations for believing in Jesus as Savior. The student's interpretation of the passages focuses more on Jesus' role as a loving and faithful servant rather than His salvific work. The answer also lacks a clear connection between the passage and the concern.\n\nThe student's response primarily summarizes the passages without demonstrating an understanding of how these texts establish Jesus as Savior. To receive a higher grade, the student would need to demonstrate a deeper comprehension of the biblical foundations for this doctrine and explicitly connect their analysis back to the concern.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates some familiarity with the biblical passages, but it falls short in providing a meaningful connection to the concern. The student's understanding of Jesus as Savior is not clearly established through scriptural foundations."
