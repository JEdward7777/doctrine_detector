While the passages mentioned focus on Jesus as a loving and faithful servant who guides and helps believers grow in holiness, they do not directly address the foundational Christian belief in Jesus as the Savior who delivers believers from sin and provides eternal life. The response could have been improved by drawing more explicitly on the passages to support the belief in Jesus as Savior."
