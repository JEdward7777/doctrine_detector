The Bible has several verses that reference Jesus as the cornerstone. Here are some of them:

1 Corinthians 3:16 - "I am also a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I am entrusted to me this commandment, that whoever loves me will love me also, and whoever loves me will be with me, and I will come to you to be with you.

2 Corinthians 5:7 - "For we are also a Christian commandment to love one another, so that we may love the Lord our Savior.

Ephesians 4:13 - "And above all these prayers, let us pray that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit, and that we may be able to help and love those who are in need of Jesus Christ our Lord.

Jeremiah 23:39 - "And I will be a blessing to you, and I will be a holy commandment to you, and I will send peace to you and I will send peace to everyone who loves me and who loves me who is called to be my Christian servant.

Revelation 22:17 - "I am the Lord Jesus Christ, who loves you and wants to bless you and make you holy. I am the Holy Spirit, who comes upon you and gives you peace and joy.

These verses convey that Jesus is the ultimate source of love and peace, and that He is the foundation of our faith. He is the cornerstone of our salvation and the Holy Spirit that guides us on our journey to follow Him.
