  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response provides several Bible verses that highlight Jesus as the cornerstone, which aligns with the concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture deepens their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith. The verses quoted from Corinthians, Corinthians again, Ephesians, Jeremiah, and Revelation convey the idea that Jesus is the ultimate source of love and peace, and that He is the foundation of our faith.\n\nHowever, the response doesn't directly address the specific answer provided (Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, Psalms 118:22). While it does mention Jesus as the cornerstone, it doesn't explicitly connect this concept to the Church or the foundation of faith.\n\nTo improve the response, I would suggest incorporating the specific answer provided and directly connecting it to the concern. For example, the response could explore how these verses (Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, Psalms 118:22) highlight Jesus' essential role in the foundation of faith and the Church, and how this understanding can deepen one's faith.\n\nOverall, while the response is strong in its biblical support, it could be improved by more directly addressing the specific answer provided and concern."
