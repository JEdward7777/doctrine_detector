## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Cornerstone.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible has several verses that reference Jesus as the cornerstone. Here are some of them:

1 Corinthians 3:16 - "I am also a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I am entrusted to me this commandment, that whoever loves me will love me also, and whoever loves me will be with me, and I will come to you to be with you.

2 Corinthians 5:7 - "For we are also a Christian commandment to love one another, so that we may love the Lord our Savior.

Ephesians 4:13 - "And above all these prayers, let us pray that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit, and that we may be able to help and love those who are in need of Jesus Christ our Lord.

Jeremiah 23:39 - "And I will be a blessing to you, and I will be a holy commandment to you, and I will send peace to you and I will send peace to everyone who loves me and who loves me who is called to be my Christian servant.

Revelation 22:17 - "I am the Lord Jesus Christ, who loves you and wants to bless you and make you holy. I am the Holy Spirit, who comes upon you and gives you peace and joy.

These verses convey that Jesus is the ultimate source of love and peace, and that He is the foundation of our faith. He is the cornerstone of our salvation and the Holy Spirit that guides us on our journey to follow Him.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 80.

The response provides several Bible verses that highlight Jesus as the cornerstone, which aligns with the concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture deepens their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith. The verses quoted from Corinthians, Corinthians again, Ephesians, Jeremiah, and Revelation convey the idea that Jesus is the ultimate source of love and peace, and that He is the foundation of our faith.

However, the response doesn't directly address the specific answer provided (Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, Psalms 118:22). While it does mention Jesus as the cornerstone, it doesn't explicitly connect this concept to the Church or the foundation of faith.

To improve the response, I would suggest incorporating the specific answer provided and directly connecting it to the concern. For example, the response could explore how these verses (Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, Psalms 118:22) highlight Jesus' essential role in the foundation of faith and the Church, and how this understanding can deepen one's faith.

Overall, while the response is strong in its biblical support, it could be improved by more directly addressing the specific answer provided and concern.
