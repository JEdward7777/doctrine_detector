Ephesians 4:13 - "And above all these prayers, let us pray that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit, and that we may be able to help and love those who are in need of Jesus Christ our Lord.

Jeremiah 23:39 - "And I will be a blessing to you, and I will be a holy commandment to you, and I will send peace to you and I will send peace to everyone who loves me and who loves me who is called to be my Christian servant.

Revelation 22:17 - "I am the Lord Jesus Christ, who loves you and wants to bless you and make you holy. I am the Holy Spirit, who comes upon you and gives you peace and joy.
