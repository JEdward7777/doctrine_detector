  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided some verses from the Psalms that mention God's holiness and blessings, but the verses quoted do not specifically illustrate or emphasize God as the Most High. Additionally, the response lacks in-depth analysis or interpretation of the verses provided to reveal insights into God's character as the 'Most High.' Encouraging the student to focus on selecting verses that directly portray God's supremacy and to delve deeper into the understanding of God's character as the Most High."
