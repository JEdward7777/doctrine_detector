  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided verses that do not directly address the concept of God as the Most High and did not analyze how these verses reveal God's character in relation to His sovereignty. The response lacks depth and fails to address the concern of exploring Scripture to fully appreciate God's sovereignty. Additional biblical references and a deeper analysis of God's character as the Most High would significantly improve the answer."
