Grade: 30

Comment: The student provided a scripture reference that does mention the temple as the "House of Yahweh" (Psalm 23:6), but the text following the reference is repetitive and appears to be copied multiple times, which detracts from the overall quality of the answer. Additionally, the student did not provide multiple examples as requested in the question. The response lacks depth and clarity.
