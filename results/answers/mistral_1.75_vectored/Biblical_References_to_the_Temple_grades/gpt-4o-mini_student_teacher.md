## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: The student's response contains repetitive text and does not accurately cite specific scriptures that reference the temple as the "House of Yahweh." The inclusion of Psalm 23:6 is not relevant to the specific question asked. The student's answer lacks specificity and depth in addressing the concern outlined.
