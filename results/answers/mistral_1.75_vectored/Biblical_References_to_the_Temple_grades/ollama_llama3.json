  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe main issue with this response is that it does not address the concern of identifying key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house. Instead, it repeats the phrase \"I will always be with you to bless you and make you holy\" numerous times without providing any relevant biblical references or insights about the temple.\n\nThe only reference provided is Psalm 23:6, which is not related to the temple being referred to as the \"House of Yahweh\". The correct answers mentioned in the original response (1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4) are not even mentioned in this response."
