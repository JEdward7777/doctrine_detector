  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided extensive filler content from Psalm 23:6 that was not relevant to the question at hand. While the initial mention of key scriptures such as 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4 was correct, the excessive repetition of irrelevant text lowered the grade significantly. Focus on providing concise and relevant information to improve the grade in the future."
