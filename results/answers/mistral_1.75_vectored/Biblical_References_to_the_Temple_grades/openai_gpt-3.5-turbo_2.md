30.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: The response provided extensive filler content from Psalm 23:6 that was not relevant to the question at hand. While the initial mention of key scriptures such as 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4 was correct, the excessive repetition of irrelevant text lowered the grade significantly. Focus on providing concise and relevant information to improve the grade in the future.
