Grade: 40

Comment: The response contains some relevant information by citing key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple as the "house of Yahweh." However, the excessive repetition of a particular verse from Psalm 23 severely detracts from the overall quality of the response. It would have been more beneficial to include a diverse selection of relevant verses that support the concept of the temple as God's house. The excessive repetition impacts the coherence and effectiveness of the response.
