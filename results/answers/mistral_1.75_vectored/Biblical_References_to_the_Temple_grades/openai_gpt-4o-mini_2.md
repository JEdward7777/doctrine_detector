## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The response provided several verses from Psalms that do reference God's presence and blessing, but they were not directly related to the concept of the temple as God's house. The provided answer did mention relevant verses like 1 Kings 8:44 and 2 Chronicles 6:4, which correctly address the concern, but the lengthy inclusion of unrelated verses from Psalms brought down the overall grade.
