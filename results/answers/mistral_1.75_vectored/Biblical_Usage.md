The term "begat" is used in the genealogy accounts found in the Bible to indicate that a person was born and named after someone else. It is used to trace the lineage of Jesus Christ, as well as other important figures in the Bible. For example, the Gospel of Luke begins with the genealogy of Jesus, which includes the names of many people who were begat by others. This is done to show how Jesus is part of the Holy Bible and how He is related to the Old Testament prophets.
