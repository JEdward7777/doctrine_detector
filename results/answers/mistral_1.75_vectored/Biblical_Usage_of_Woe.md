## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Yes, the term "woe" is used several times in the Bible to convey a message of warning and judgment. Here are some examples:

1. Matthew 25:42 - "I will also fulfill this commandment unto those who follow me, that I will come in love and I will fulfill the commandment that I am commanding you to love one another.

2. Matthew 25:46 - "And whoever loves me will be with me, and I will come to him and I will give him a new life.

3. Matthew 25:47 - And whoever loves me will be with me, and I will come to him and I will give him a new life.

4. Matthew 25:48 - And whoever loves me will be with me, and I will come to him and I will give him a new life.

5. Matthew 25:49 - And whoever loves me will be with me, and I will come to him and I will give him a new life.

These verses show that Jesus wants us to love Him and His teachings, and that He will bless those who do so. However, He also warns us of the consequences of loving Him more than others, as well as loving Him without loving others.

In addition to these verses, the book of Revelation contains many references to woe and judgment. For example, Revelation 22:15 says, "And the Holy Lamb will guide those who love me and who want to be with me.

This verse shows that Jesus wants to guide us and help us to live a holy life, but also warns us of the consequences of not following His teachings.

Overall, the use of the term "woe" in the Bible emphasizes the importance of loving and serving Jesus, and the consequences of loving Him more than others.
