  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer contains significant inaccuracies and misconceptions. They did not provide accurate examples of where the term \"woe\" is used in the Bible. Their interpretation of the verses from Matthew 25 is unrelated to the concept of divine judgment and lacks theological depth. Furthermore, the student's explanation lacks coherence and does not effectively illustrate the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. Additional study and understanding of biblical concepts are needed."
