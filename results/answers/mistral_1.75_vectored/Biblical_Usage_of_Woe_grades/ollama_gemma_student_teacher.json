  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the use of the term \"woe\" in the Bible to convey a message of warning and judgment. The student provides relevant examples from Matthew and Revelation, and explains how these verses emphasize the importance of loving and serving Jesus, and the consequences of loving Him more than others. However, the student's answer could benefit from including more analysis of the specific passages referenced, and from providing additional supporting evidence from other biblical texts."
