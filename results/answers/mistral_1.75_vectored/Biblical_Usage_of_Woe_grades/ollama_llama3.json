  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does mention some examples of the term \"woe\" being used in scripture, it primarily focuses on Jesus' teachings about love and blessing, rather than examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. The response also includes multiple repeated verses from Matthew 25, which do not add much value to the discussion.\n\nThe concern was to examine the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture, but this response only touches on this aspect briefly in its mention of Revelation 22:15. To address this concern more thoroughly, the response could have delved deeper into the biblical passages that emphasize severe judgment upon those who sin or lead others astray.\n\nOverall, while the response does contain some relevant information and scriptural references, it falls short of fully addressing the concern and providing a comprehensive examination of divine judgment as expressed through scripture."
