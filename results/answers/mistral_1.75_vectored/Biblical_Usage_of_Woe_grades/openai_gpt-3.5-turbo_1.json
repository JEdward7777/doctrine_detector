  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides relevant biblical examples and connects the term \"woe\" to a message of warning and judgment, aligning well with the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment in scripture. However, there are inaccuracies in the interpretation of the provided Bible verses in the response, such as misquoting Matthew 25 verses and not accurately representing the content of Revelation 22:15. It would be beneficial to ensure a more precise understanding and explanation of the biblical passages referenced in order to improve the accuracy of the response."
