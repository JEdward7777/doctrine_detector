  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant examples of how the term \"woe\" is used in the Bible to convey a message of warning and judgment. However, it lacks depth in explaining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. Additionally, some of the verses cited in the response do not actually contain the term \"woe,\" which slightly detracts from the accuracy of the discussion. More focused analysis and a stronger connection to the concern would improve the grade."
