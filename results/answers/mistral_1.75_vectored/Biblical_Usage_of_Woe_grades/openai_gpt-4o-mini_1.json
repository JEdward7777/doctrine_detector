  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided some examples of the term \"woe\" being used in the context of warning and judgment in the Bible, but it lacked depth in connecting these examples to the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. While the response did mention consequences, it did not fully explore the gravity and implications of divine judgment for those who do not follow God's commandments. To improve, the student should delve deeper into the significance of divine judgment and the eternal consequences of sin as portrayed in the Bible."
