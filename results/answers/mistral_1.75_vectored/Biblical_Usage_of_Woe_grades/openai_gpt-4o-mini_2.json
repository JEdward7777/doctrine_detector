  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: This response correctly identifies the use of the term \"woe\" in the Bible to convey a message of warning and judgment, referencing appropriate verses and highlighting the consequences of sin and straying from God's teachings. However, the student's interpretation lacks depth and fails to fully convey the gravity of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. There is room for improvement in connecting the examples provided to a deeper theological understanding of the seriousness of divine judgment in a Christian worldview."
