However, it could have further explored the broader spiritual implications and symbolic meanings of \"Zion\" in Christian theology, connecting these aspects to the concept of Israel as God's spiritual kingdom and the future heavenly Jerusalem. Additionally, integrating specific biblical references to support these interpretations would have strengthened the response."
