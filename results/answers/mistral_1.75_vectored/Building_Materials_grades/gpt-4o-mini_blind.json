  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: \n- While the student makes an effort to list some materials mentioned in the Bible, the response is quite confused and inaccurate. \n- The student inaccurately states that Jesus was crucified on a wooden cross, not an altar, and incorrectly connects Jesus' baptism with the construction of altars.\n- The references to lambs, oil, bread, and wine are not materials used to physically build altars but rather elements used in sacrificial and ceremonial practices.\n- The response lacks clarity and precision in connecting the materials mentioned to altar construction in biblical times.\n- The theological and contextual errors in the response lower the grade significantly. \n\nOverall, the student's answer lacks accuracy and a clear understanding of the materials used in the construction of altars during biblical times."
