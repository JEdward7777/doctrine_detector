The mention of lambs, bread, and wine as materials for constructing altars is incorrect. The use of lambs in sacrifices and bread and wine in communion is distinct from the physical construction of altars. Additionally, the focus on Jesus' specific actions rather than the materials used in altar construction detracts from the depth of understanding required for this question. There is room for improvement in aligning the response with biblical teachings on altar materials."
