  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 30.\n\nWhile the response mentions some common materials used in building altars, it only scratches the surface of the topic. The main concern was knowing the materials and structure of altars to deepen understanding of biblical practices and reverence associated with worship. This response does not address that concern in a meaningful way, as it primarily lists materials without providing context or insight into their significance.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more detail about the specific altars mentioned in the Bible, such as the altar of sacrifice (Exodus 20:24-26) and the golden altar of incense (Exodus 30:1-6). Additionally, exploring how these materials were used in biblical practices and worship would demonstrate a deeper understanding of their significance."
