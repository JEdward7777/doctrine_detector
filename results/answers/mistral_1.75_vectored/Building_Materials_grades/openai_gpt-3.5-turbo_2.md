2. Stone: Stone was also used in the construction of altars. The Bible mentions that Jesus was also baptized with water and was prayed upon by Jesus.

3. Lambs: Lambs were also used in the construction of altars. The Bible mentions that Jesus was sacrificed for the sins of all people, and this sacrifice was done through the use of lambs.

4. Oil: Oil was also used in the construction of altars. The Bible mentions that Jesus was anointed with oil before He went to the Holy Spirit to be filled.
