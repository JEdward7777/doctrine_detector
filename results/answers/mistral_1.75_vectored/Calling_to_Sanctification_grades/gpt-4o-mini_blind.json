However, there are some key doctrinal inaccuracies in referencing Acts 2:38 and Acts 5:46 in relation to the specific command for sanctification. Acts 2:38 refers to repentance and baptism for the forgiveness of sins and receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit, which is essential for salvation but not the specific command for ongoing sanctification. Acts 5:46 does not contain the content mentioned in the response. It would be beneficial for the student to provide scriptural references that directly address the command for believers' personal sanctification. Additionally, a clearer distinction between initial salvation and the ongoing process of sanctification would strengthen the response."
