  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student mentions important aspects of sanctification like living a life of love, peace, and obedience through the Holy Spirit, sharing the Gospel, prayer, and growing in faith. However, the specific command regarding personal sanctification given to believers is not clearly addressed in their response. The emphasis on personal responsibility in the sanctification process is somewhat overshadowed by a more general overview of living out the Christian faith. It would have been beneficial for the student to focus more on the direct command to sanctify oneself to God and be holy."
