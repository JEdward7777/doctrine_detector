It correctly references Biblical passages and acknowledges that sanctification is a lifelong commitment requiring ongoing growth and transformation in the Holy Spirit. However, the response could benefit from clearer connections between the specific command in Acts 2:38 and Acts 5:46 with the broader concept of sanctification. Additionally, further elaboration on how personal responsibility plays a role in this process would strengthen the argument."
