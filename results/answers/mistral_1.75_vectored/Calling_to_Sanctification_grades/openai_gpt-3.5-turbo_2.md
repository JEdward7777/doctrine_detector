## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that believers are called to be holy and to live a life of love, peace, and obedience. This is done through the Holy Spirit who guides and empowers believers to live according to the teachings of Jesus Christ.

The specific command to believers to be sanctified is found in Acts 2:38, where it says "And you will be filled with the Holy Spirit." This promise is also found in Acts 5:46, where it says "Acts 5:46 And we have prayed for you and have imparted on you the Holy Spirit to help you to fulfill what is most important.

In addition to this, believers are also called to pray for guidance and protection, to share the Gospel message with others, to serve and love one another, and to grow in their faith and relationship with Jesus Christ.

It's important to remember that sanctification is a process that involves ongoing growth and transformation in the Holy Spirit. It is not a one-time event but a lifelong commitment to follow Jesus Christ and to be filled with the Holy Spirit.

Comment: The response effectively explains the biblical teaching on believers being called to be holy and live a life of love, peace, and obedience. It correctly highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in guiding and empowering believers. The reference to Acts 2:38 and Acts 5:46 supports the point made. Additionally, the response acknowledges the ongoing process of sanctification through personal commitment to following Jesus Christ. However, it could further emphasize personal responsibility in actively participating and cooperating with the Holy Spirit in the sanctification process.
