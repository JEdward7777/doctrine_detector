  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively conveys the biblical teaching on believers being called to sanctify themselves to God and live a holy life. It also appropriately emphasizes personal responsibility in the sanctification process by highlighting the need for believers to actively engage with the Holy Spirit, pray for guidance, share the Gospel, serve others, and continually grow in faith. However, the specific references provided from Acts 2:38 and 5:46 do not directly support the claim about believers being commanded to sanctify themselves, which slightly detracts from the overall clarity and coherence of the response."
