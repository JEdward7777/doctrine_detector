The connection to Acts 2:38 and Acts 5:46 was relevant, supporting the understanding of sanctification. However, while emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit, the response could have more explicitly highlighted the importance of personal responsibility in cooperating with the sanctification process. Encouraging believers to actively participate and take responsibility for their own growth in faith would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
