It correctly emphasizes the recognition of Jesus as Lord and the importance of submitting to His authority. However, a more in-depth exploration of the theological implications of the centurion's faith and Jesus' response could enhance the answer. Additionally, linking specific biblical passages or doctrines related to faith and authority would strengthen the doctrinal component of the response."
