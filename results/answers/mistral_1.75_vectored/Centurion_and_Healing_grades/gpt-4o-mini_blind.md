The interaction between the centurion and Jesus reveals several important aspects of faith and authority.

Third, the centurion's response to Jesus' command to go and be blessed is a powerful example of faith. He recognized that Jesus was speaking in the name of God and trusted in His words. This shows that true faith involves trusting in Jesus and following His teachings, even when they may seem difficult or unexpected.

Comment: The response provides a good analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus regarding faith and authority. It correctly emphasizes the recognition of Jesus as Lord and the importance of submitting to His authority. However, a more in-depth exploration of the theological implications of the centurion's faith and Jesus' response could enhance the answer. Additionally, linking specific biblical passages or doctrines related to faith and authority would strengthen the doctrinal component of the response.
