  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus, highlighting key aspects of faith and authority. However, the student's answer could have been more focused on the specific nature of faith and authority in the context of Jesus' ministry, as outlined in the concern. The student effectively captured the importance of recognizing Jesus as Lord and submitting to His authority but could have delved deeper into the unique dynamics between faith and authority in this specific interaction."
