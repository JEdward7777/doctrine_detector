The centurion's visit to Peter represents the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community in several ways. First, the centurion is a Gentile, which means he is not part of the Jewish community. By coming to Peter, he shows that the Gospel is not just for Jews but also for Gentiles. Second, the centurion comes to Peter with a request for healing, showing that the Gospel can bring peace and healing to all people, regardless of their background. Finally, the centurion's faith and obedience to Jesus show that the Gospel is not just for Jews who follow the Old Testament but also for Gentiles who follow Jesus. This represents the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community to include Gentiles who are followers of Jesus.
