The student effectively mentions the centurion being a Gentile, the healing request, and the centurion's faith and obedience to Jesus. However, to further enhance the answer, the student could have elaborated more on the significance of Peter's vision regarding the acceptance of Gentiles into the Christian community and the subsequent spreading of the Gospel to them. Nonetheless, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
