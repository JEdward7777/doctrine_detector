  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response effectively explains how the centurion's visit to Peter signifies the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community by emphasizing the inclusion of Gentiles in the message of salvation. However, the answer could have further elaborated on the significance of God's love for all people and the importance of reaching out to different nations, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a good understanding of the topic and a solid explanation provided."
