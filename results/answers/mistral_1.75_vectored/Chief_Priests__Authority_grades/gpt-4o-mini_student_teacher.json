  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the hierarchy of authority between chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Israel. According to the Christian worldview, the chief priests did hold a higher rank and authority, but the student's answer misrepresents their roles and responsibilities. The student would benefit from further study and clarification on the topic."
