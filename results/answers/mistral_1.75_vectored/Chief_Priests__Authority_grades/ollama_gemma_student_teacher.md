## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly states that the chief priests held a leadership role over the ordinary priests and were responsible for guiding them in their duties. However, the answer lacks nuance and fails to fully acknowledge the hierarchical structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel, as indicated by the reference answer. Additionally, the student's answer does not elaborate on the specific authorities and responsibilities of the high priest, which is an important aspect of the concern being examined.
