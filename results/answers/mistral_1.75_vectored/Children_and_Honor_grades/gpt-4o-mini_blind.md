Comment: The student's response provides a general understanding of the concept of honoring parents as taught in the Bible. The reference to Ephesians 6:7 is not accurate as the specific verse on honoring parents is Ephesians 6:1-3 which states, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother' (this is the first commandment with a promise), 'that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.'" The student could have provided a more thorough explanation of the biblical principles and significance behind honoring parents according to Christian teachings.
