  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a decent overview of the usage of the term \"Christ\" in the New Testament, highlighting various aspects of Jesus's identity. However, the answer lacked depth and theological insight into the significance of the title 'Christ' in deepening understanding of Jesus's identity and purpose. The reference answer provided a clearer and more focused explanation on this aspect. The student could improve by delving deeper into the theological implications of Jesus being referred to as 'the Anointed One' and how this title signifies His divine appointment as the Savior in the Christian faith."
