  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: \nThe response provides some insightful practical ways that modern Christians can adopt the teachings of the Old Testament regarding ritual cleanliness. The emphasis on prayer, Bible study, fasting, Holy Communion, love, forgiveness, humility, and prayer for protection aligns well with Christian beliefs and practices. However, to improve the grade, the student could have provided more specific examples or references from the Old Testament to support each practice mentioned. Additionally, mentioning the importance of confessing sins and seeking repentance could have enhanced the answer further. Overall, a solid response but with room for deeper theological elaboration."
