  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 70.\n\nComment: The student provides a thoughtful list of practices that modern Christians can adopt to reflect the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness. They offer a variety of suggestions encompassing prayer, Bible study, fasting, communion, love, forgiveness, humility, and prayer for protection. While these practices are all valuable and relevant to spiritual growth, they could strengthen their answer by emphasizing more direct connections to the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness. The reference answer focuses specifically on repentance, confession, and spiritual discipline, which are more closely aligned with the ritualistic aspects of the Old Testament teachings. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of how contemporary faith practices can align with ancient teachings, but could benefit from more focus on the specific concept of ritual cleanliness."
