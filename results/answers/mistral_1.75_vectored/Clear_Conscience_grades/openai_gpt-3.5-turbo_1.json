It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how maintaining a clear conscience is essential for spiritual health and alignment with God's will. The only suggested improvement would be to further elaborate on the connection between a clear conscience and peace/joy in the Holy Spirit, to deepen the understanding of the topic."
