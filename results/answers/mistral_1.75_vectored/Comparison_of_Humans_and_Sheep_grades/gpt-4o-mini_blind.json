  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response lacks coherence and focus. It meanders without providing a clear explanation of the significance of the comparison between humans and sheep in the context of biblical teaching. The content does not effectively address the question posed and lacks depth and accurate understanding of the biblical teaching on this subject. The explanation is repetitive and fails to provide a clear and structured analysis. More focused and relevant content is needed to improve the grade."
