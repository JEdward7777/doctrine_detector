  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response lacks coherence and strays off topic, failing to address the given concern about human vulnerability and the need for divine guidance as depicted in the Bible. Additionally, the answer does not effectively explore the significance of the comparison between humans and sheep in biblical teaching, as required by the question. The student needs to focus on providing a more relevant and structured response in alignment with the concern provided."
