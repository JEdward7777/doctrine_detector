  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe primary issue with this response is that it fails to address the concern and provide meaningful reflection on human vulnerability and the need for divine guidance as depicted in the Bible. Instead, the response repeatedly asks the same question about the servant who wanted to be like Jesus and repeats the phrase \"the servant who was given two servants said that he would be happy to help\" numerous times without providing any insight or depth.\n\nThe only attempt at an answer is a brief comparison between humans and sheep, which is not developed further. The response does not demonstrate an understanding of the biblical passage or its relevance to human vulnerability and the need for divine guidance. Overall, the response lacks substance, coherence, and engagement with the concern, making it difficult to justify a higher grade."
