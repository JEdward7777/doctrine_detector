In the Bible, Jesus often uses parables to teach important lessons. One such parable is the story of Jesus and the sheep (Matthew 25:1-46). In this parable, Jesus teaches about the importance of being faithful and loving to others.

In the story, Jesus tells a parable about a servant who was given two servants to look after while he went away to serve his Lord. The servant who was given two servants was told to love and care for them and to do the same for everyone who comes to him. He was also told to be faithful and to help those who were in need.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 20.

The primary issue with this response is that it fails to address the concern and provide meaningful reflection on human vulnerability and the need for divine guidance as depicted in the Bible. Instead, the response repeatedly asks the same question about the servant who wanted to be like Jesus and repeats the phrase "the servant who was given two servants said that he would be happy to help" numerous times without providing any insight or depth.

The only attempt at an answer is a brief comparison between humans and sheep, which is not developed further. The response does not demonstrate an understanding of the biblical passage or its relevance to human vulnerability and the need for divine guidance. Overall, the response lacks substance, coherence, and engagement with the concern, making it difficult to justify a higher grade.
