  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response does not effectively address the concern provided. While the parable of Jesus and the sheep may illustrate human vulnerability and the need for divine guidance, the response veers off track by repeating a section of the parable multiple times without further elaboration or analysis. The connection between the given answer and the concern is lacking, resulting in a low grade for not fully engaging with the specific Christian worldview focus."
