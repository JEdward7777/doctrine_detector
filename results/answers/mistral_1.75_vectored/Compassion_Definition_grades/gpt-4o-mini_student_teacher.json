  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of actions associated with being compassionate, which aligns well with the teacher's reference answer. However, the student's definition of compassion as \"a deep love and desire to help others\" is broader than the reference answer's definition of \"a feeling of concern for those who are suffering\". The student's answer could have been enhanced by focusing more on the feeling of concern aspect emphasized in the reference answer."
