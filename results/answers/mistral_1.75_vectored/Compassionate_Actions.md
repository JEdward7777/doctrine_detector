1. Jesus Christ: Jesus is known for his unconditional love and compassion towards all people. He taught us to love our neighbors as ourselves (Matthew 22:39) and to serve others as he served me (John 13:34).

2. Mary Magdalene: Mary Magdalene was a woman who was deeply loved by Jesus and was also known for her compassionate heart. She was one of the first to come to the site of Jesus' crucifision and was also present at the resurrection.

3. The Samaritan: The Samaritan is a story about a man who was robbed and beaten on the road to Jerusalem. He was then taken to the Samaritan who helped him and gave him a commandment to love your neighbor as yourself.

4. The Parable of the Good Samaritan: This parable teaches us to love our enemies and to be kind to those who have wronged us. It tells the story of a man who was robbed and beaten and was then taken to a Samaritan who helped him and gave him a commandment to love your neighbor as yourself.

5. The Parable of the Widow and the Mite: This parable teaches us to give to those in need and to always remember that even a small act of kindness can bring great joy. It tells the story of a widow who gave a small amount of money to help fulfill the mission of Jesus.
