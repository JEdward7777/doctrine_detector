  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples of compassion in the Bible, such as Jesus, Mary Magdalene, the Samaritan, and the Parable of the Good Samaritan. However, the examples do not fully align with the concern as they focus more on individuals showing compassion rather than recognizing real-life applications of compassion as modeled by biblical figures. To improve, the student could provide examples that directly illustrate how biblical figures' compassion can be applied in everyday life, as shown in the teacher's reference answer."
