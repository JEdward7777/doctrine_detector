  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student attempted to address the question but misunderstood the key teachings in the verses provided. Matthew 12:7 speaks about mercy and not condemnation, emphasizing the importance of mercy over sacrifice. Psalm 34:22 focuses on the righteous being afflicted but being delivered from all troubles by God. The student's interpretation lacks accuracy in understanding the biblical teachings on punishment and condemnation. More precise analysis and understanding of the verses are needed to improve the grade."
