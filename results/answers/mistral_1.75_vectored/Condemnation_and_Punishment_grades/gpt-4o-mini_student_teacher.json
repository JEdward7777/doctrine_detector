  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student does not accurately address the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. Their interpretation of the verses from Matthew and Psalms focuses more on forgiveness, humility, and blessings rather than the interplay between justice and mercy in the context of punishment and condemnation. The student should delve deeper into the specific teachings of Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 to connect them to the concern provided."
