  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response effectively references the specific verses provided and relates them to the importance of forgiveness and humility in fulfilling God's commands, which aligns well with the given answer focusing on divine justice and mercy. However, there could be a more explicit connection made between the verses and the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. More in-depth analysis and critical reflection on how forgiveness and humility impact this balance would enhance the response."
