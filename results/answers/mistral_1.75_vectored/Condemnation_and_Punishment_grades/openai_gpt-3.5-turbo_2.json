It connects these teachings to the importance of mercy in God's valuing system. However, the response could delve deeper into the specific balance between divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment. Adding more analysis on how the concepts of forgiveness and humility intersect with divine justice and mercy in the context of punishment would strengthen the overall argument."
