  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: The student's response contains many repetitive and incoherent parts that do not directly address the question. While they attempted to reference Bible verses, the interpretation and application of these verses lack clarity and focus. The student should work on organizing their thoughts cohesively and providing a more concise and accurate explanation of the relationship between confessing Jesus as Lord and salvation according to Paul's writings."
