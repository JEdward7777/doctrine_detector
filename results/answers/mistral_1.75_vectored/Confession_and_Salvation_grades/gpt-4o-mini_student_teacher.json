  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response contains some relevant verses and attempts to explain the importance of confessing Jesus as Lord in salvation. However, the student's answer lacks focus and coherence, veering off-topic and repeating points unnecessarily. The student should focus on directly addressing the concern and providing a clear and concise explanation based on the reference answer given by the teacher."
