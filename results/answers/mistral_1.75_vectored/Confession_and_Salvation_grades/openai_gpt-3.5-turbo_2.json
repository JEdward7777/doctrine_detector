  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response started well by referencing Paul's teaching on confessing Jesus as Lord and the belief in His resurrection for salvation. However, the additional content strayed off-topic and repeated itself excessively, losing focus on the theological implications of confession and belief in salvation. The response lacked depth and clarity in addressing the specific concern provided."
