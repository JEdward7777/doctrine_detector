  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response lacks clarity and coherence in addressing the concern about the theological implications of confession and belief in salvation, as it goes off-topic and repeats the same content multiple times. It fails to provide a deep analysis or explanation rooted in a Christian worldview. The student should focus on providing concise, relevant information with proper theological insights in future responses."
