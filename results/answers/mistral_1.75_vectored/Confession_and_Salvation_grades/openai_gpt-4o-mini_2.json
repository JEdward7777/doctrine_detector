  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: The response contains some relevant biblical verses but veers off-track with repetitive content that seems to lose focus on the theological implications of confession and belief in salvation. The initial reference to Paul's teaching is relevant, but the subsequent sections become repetitive and do not directly address the specific concern about the theological implications of confession and belief in salvation. Further explanation and analysis focusing on how confession of Jesus as Lord and belief in His resurrection lead to salvation would strengthen the response."
