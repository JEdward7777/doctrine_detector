  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, praying for strength, striving to do what is right, seeking support from other Christians, and turning to Jesus for forgiveness. However, the focus on acknowledging personal sin and the importance of confessing sins to God for forgiveness, as emphasized in the reference answer, could have been more prominent in the response. Encouraging a deeper reflection on personal sin and forgiveness from God would strengthen the student's answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
