  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of acknowledging personal sin and seeking God's forgiveness. However, the response could benefit from a clearer articulation of the need for confession as a specific act of obedience and humility before God. Additionally, the student's answer lacks a direct reference to the act of confessing sins as outlined in the reference answer."
