## [Answer](../Confession_of_Sins.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
According to the Bible, a Christian should always seek guidance and help from the Holy Spirit to overcome temptation. Jesus Christ also said that we should pray for strength and guidance in times of temptation (Matthew 7:7).

In addition, Christians are called to be holy and to love God above all else. This means that we should always strive to do what is right and to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. If you are tempted to sin, it is important to remember that Jesus is always with you and will guide you to do what is right.

It is also important to seek support from other Christians who can offer prayer and encouragement. The Bible teaches us to encourage one another in our faith and to help each other in times of need (Ephesians 4:23-24).

Finally, if you have sinned and are seeking forgiveness, you can always turn to Jesus Christ, who loves you unconditionally and wants to forgive you and help you to live a new life in Him.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 85/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of acknowledging personal sin and seeking God's forgiveness. However, the response could benefit from a clearer articulation of the need for confession as a specific act of obedience and humility before God. Additionally, the student's answer lacks a direct reference to the act of confessing sins as outlined in the reference answer.
