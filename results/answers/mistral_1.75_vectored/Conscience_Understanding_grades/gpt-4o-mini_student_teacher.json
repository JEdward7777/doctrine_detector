  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a decent explanation of conscience from a Christian perspective, highlighting its role in discerning right from wrong and seeking forgiveness. However, there is room for improvement in the depth of biblical understanding and the direct connection to God's role in shaping our conscience. Encouraging further exploration of specific biblical passages and theological teachings on conscience would enhance the answer for a higher grade."
