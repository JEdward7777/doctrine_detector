The inclusion of key figures such as Jesus, Mary, and the apostles is solid. However, it would have been beneficial to provide more specific references or stories from the Bible to support each individual's consecration to God. Additionally, emphasizing the significance of consecration to God in relation to each person's role and impact in biblical history would have enhanced the depth of the answer."
