**Comments:** 

The student's answer adequately identifies several individuals in the Bible who were consecrated to God, providing concise summaries of their significance. However, the response could benefit from broader inclusion of other explicitly consecrated individuals mentioned in the Bible, such as the priests and the people of Israel as per the reference answer. Additionally, including more specific references to their acts of consecration would strengthen the overall response.
