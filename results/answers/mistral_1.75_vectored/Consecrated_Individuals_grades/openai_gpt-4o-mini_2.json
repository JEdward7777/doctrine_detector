  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good list of individuals in the Bible who were consecrated to God and demonstrates an understanding of the significance of consecrated individuals in biblical history. The examples given align well with the concern and show knowledge of key figures who were chosen and set apart for specific purposes in service to God. A slightly higher grade could be achieved by adding more depth or insights into the biblical narratives of these consecrated individuals."
