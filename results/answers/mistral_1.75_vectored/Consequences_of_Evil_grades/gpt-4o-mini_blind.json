  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The student provides verses from the Bible but fails to properly connect them to the consequences of evil. The responses are disjointed and lack a cohesive explanation of the consequences of evil as illustrated in the biblical references. Additionally, some verses provided are not directly related to the consequences of evil. The answer lacks depth and coherence in addressing the question. More focus on explaining the specific consequences of evil in light of the biblical references would improve the grade."
