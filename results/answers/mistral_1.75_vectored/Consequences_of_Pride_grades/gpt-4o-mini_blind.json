However, there are some inaccuracies such as the citation of Matthew 26:26, which actually pertains to the institution of the Eucharist rather than humility and pride. Additionally, the reference to Proverbs 3:17 seems to be a combination of different thoughts. The response could be improved by providing clearer and more accurate biblical references that directly address the consequences of pride and the importance of humility."
