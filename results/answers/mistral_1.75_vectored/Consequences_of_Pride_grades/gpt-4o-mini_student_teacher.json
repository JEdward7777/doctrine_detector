  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant Bible verses that touch on the consequences of pride and the importance of humility. However, there were some inaccuracies in referencing the verses (e.g., Matthew 26:26 should be Matthew 20:27). The explanation could have been more in-depth and could have included a clearer contrast between pride and humility as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the interpretations of the verses could have been more focused on the spiritual implications rather than solely on actions."
