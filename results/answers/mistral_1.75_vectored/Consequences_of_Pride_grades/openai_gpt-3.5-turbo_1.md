## [Answer](../Consequences_of_Pride.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that pride is a sin that can have serious consequences. In the Bible, Jesus said, "For whoever wants to be first must be servant of all" (Matthew 26:26). This verse teaches us that we should always put others before ourselves and serve them with love and humility.

In the book of Proverbs, it says, "Pride goes before a fall; humble and repentful love will be fulfilled" (Proverts 3:17). This verse reminds us that pride can lead to sin and ultimately lead to a fall.

The Bible also teaches us to be humble in prayer. Jesus said, "And pray, 'Our Father who loves me, forgive me for this sin I have done.' For this is how we should always pray and enter into our prayer: 'Our Father who loves me, holy and loving Lord, we pray that you would come to us in your Holy Spirit, help us to remember the forgivable Holy Spirit, and help us to love and pray for those who are persecuted and pray for the peace of the whole Church and for the peace of the whole world'." (Luke 22:39-40).

In addition to these verses, there are many other passages in the Bible that teach us the importance of humility and the consequences of pride.
