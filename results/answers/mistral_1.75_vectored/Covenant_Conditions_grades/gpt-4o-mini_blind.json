The examples provided do not accurately reflect the nature of conditional and unconditional covenants as found in Scripture. Additionally, the references to the Great Commission and the Lord's Prayer do not directly pertain to covenants. The student should revise their understanding of covenants in the Bible to provide a more accurate response."
