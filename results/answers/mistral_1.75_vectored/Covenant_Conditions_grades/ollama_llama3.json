The repeated quotes from the Lord's Prayer do not directly relate to the concept of unconditional or conditional covenants, and instead seem to be a copy-paste job without any meaningful explanation or connection to the original answer. A better response would have provided more relevant examples that illustrate the differences between unconditional and conditional covenants and how they reflect God's promises and expectations."
