## Question [Covenant Conditions](../../../questions/Covenant_Conditions.md)
What are some examples of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible?

Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

Grade: 20

Comment: While the response attempts to provide examples of unconditional and conditional covenants, it does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants as specified in the concern. The repeated quotes from the Lord's Prayer do not directly relate to the concept of unconditional or conditional covenants, and instead seem to be a copy-paste job without any meaningful explanation or connection to the original answer. A better response would have provided more relevant examples that illustrate the differences between unconditional and conditional covenants and how they reflect God's promises and expectations.
