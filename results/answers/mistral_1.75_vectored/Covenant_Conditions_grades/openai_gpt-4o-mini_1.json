  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided lists verses from the New Testament, specifically the Lord's Prayer, as examples of unconditional covenants, which is inaccurate. The concern focuses on understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants, yet the provided response does not address this concern effectively. The response lacks a clear explanation or analysis of how conditional and unconditional covenants operate based on the given answer. Additional depth and clarity are needed to improve the grade."
