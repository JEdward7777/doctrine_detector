  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided confuses the understanding of conditional and unconditional covenants and does not correctly apply them to the examples given. The examples listed under conditional and unconditional covenants do not align with the characteristics described in the given answer. It shows a misunderstanding of the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants. The response lacks coherence and accuracy in connecting the biblical passages to the concept of conditional and unconditional covenants."
