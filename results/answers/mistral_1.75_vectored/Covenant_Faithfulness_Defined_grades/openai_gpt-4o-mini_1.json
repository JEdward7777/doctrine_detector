However, it could have delved deeper into how covenant faithfulness impacts our relationship with God, particularly in terms of our own response to His faithfulness and the significance of living out His teachings. An additional mention of the mutual aspect of covenant faithfulness between God and His people would have enhanced the explanation further."
