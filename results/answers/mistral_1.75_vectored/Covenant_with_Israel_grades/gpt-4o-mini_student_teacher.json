However, the answer lacked specificity in addressing the concern about recognizing the importance of God's promises and relationship with His chosen people. The reference answer succinctly highlighted the core aspect of the covenant, which is that the Israelites were God's chosen people, and this concept should have been emphasized more in the student's response from a Christian worldview."
