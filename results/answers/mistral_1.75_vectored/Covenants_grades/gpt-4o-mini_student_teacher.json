  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response gives a thorough explanation of how the promises made in biblical covenants illustrate God's commitment to His people. The student draws on relevant biblical examples and highlights important aspects such as God's love, faithfulness, mercy, and guidance. However, the response could be improved by focusing more on specific biblical covenants, like those with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as the reference answer does. Emphasizing these specific covenants would provide a stronger biblical foundation for the argument. Overall, a solid response with room for a deeper engagement with the biblical text."
