  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of expanding on the initial answer, providing specific examples from Scripture to illustrate God's commitment to His people. The author effectively shows how the promises in biblical covenants demonstrate God's love, faithfulness, and mercy. The discussion is well-organized and easy to follow, making it clear that the author has a good understanding of the topic.\n\nThe only areas where the response falls short are in terms of explicitly addressing the concern about recognizing the continuity of God's promises helping believers see the overarching narrative of redemption in the Bible. While the response does touch on this theme, it could be more explicit and direct in highlighting how the promises in biblical covenants fit into the larger story of redemption.\n\nOverall, however, the response is strong and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. With some refinement to explicitly address the concern, the grade could potentially be even higher."
