## [Answer](../Covenants.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The promises made in biblical covenants illustrate God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture in several ways. First, these promises show that God loves and cares deeply for His people. He wants to bless them and protect them, and He promises to be with them always. For example, Jesus said, "I am with you always" (Matthew 26:39). This promise is a reminder of Jesus' love and commitment to His followers.

Second, these promises demonstrate that God is faithful and true to His word. He promises to fulfill His promises, even when they are difficult or costly. For instance, God promised Abraham that He would make him a blessing and a blessing to all nations (Genesis 12:7). This promise was fulfilled through Jesus Christ, who became a blessing to all people.

Third, these promises remind us that God is a loving and merciful God. He promises forgiveness and salvation to those who repent and follow Him. For example, Jesus said, "For I am forgiven, so I want to forgive you too" (Luke 7:14). This promise shows that God's love and forgiveness are available to everyone who wants to receive it.

Finally, these promises teach us that God is a faithful and loving Father. He promises to guide and protect His people, even when they are in the midst of trials and difficulties. For example, Jesus said, "I am with you always, until I come to fulfill the Holy Scriptures" (Matthew 26:39). This promise reminds us that Jesus is always with us, even during times of persecution and suffering.

In summary, the promises made in biblical covenants illustrate God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture. These promises show that God loves and cares for His people, is faithful and true to His word, is a loving and merciful God, and is a faithful and loving Father.
