## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Jewish view of Gentiles was influenced by their cultural practices, which included the following:

1. Circumcision: This was a significant practice in the Old Testament and was considered a sign of being part of God's covenant. Jesus was circumcised according to the Jewish law.

2. Sabbah: The Sabbah is a day of worship and rest that is observed on Saturday in the Jewish tradition. Jesus also observed this day of worship.

3. Passover: This is a week-long celebration that commemorates the deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. It is also a time for forgiveness and redemption.

4. Holy Days: There are several holy days in the Jewish calendar, including the Day of Pentecost, which is a time of prayer and repentance.

These cultural practices had an impact on early Christian practices as well. For example, Jesus and his followers observed the Sabbah and the Holy Days, and Jesus also taught about the importance of loving one's neighbor, which is a central teaching in the Bible. Additionally, Jesus' teachings about love and forgiveness are rooted in the Jewish tradition of the Passover.
