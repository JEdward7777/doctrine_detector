  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. However, the student missed addressing the key concern of how these cultural norms influenced faith communities and their practices, specifically the important aspect of Jews avoiding eating with or associating with Gentiles which created barriers in the early church. The student could have delved deeper into the implications of this cultural practice on the early Christian community."
