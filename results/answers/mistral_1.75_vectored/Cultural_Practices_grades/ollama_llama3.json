However, it does not directly address the main issue of Gentiles being avoided by Jews, as stated in the given answer. The response primarily focuses on Jewish practices that were observed by Jesus and his followers, without explicitly discussing the avoidance of Gentiles or its impact on early Christian practices.\n\nTo improve the response, it would be helpful to include a clear connection between the cultural practices discussed and how they relate to the initial concern about Gentiles being avoided."
