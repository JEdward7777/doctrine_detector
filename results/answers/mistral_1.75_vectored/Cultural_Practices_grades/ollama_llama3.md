## Question [Cultural Practices](../../../questions/Cultural_Practices.md)
What cultural practices were associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and how did they impact early Christian practices?

## Correct Answer
Jews traditionally avoided eating with or associating with Gentiles, which initially created barriers in the early church, prompting necessary discussions about inclusivity and acceptance.

## Stated Concern
This question examines how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices.

## [Answer](../Cultural_Practices.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Jewish view of Gentiles was influenced by their cultural practices, which included the following:

1. Circumcision: This was a significant practice in the Old Testament and was considered a sign of being part of God's covenant. Jesus was circumcised according to the Jewish law.

2. Sabbah: The Sabbah is a day of worship and rest that is observed on Saturday in the Jewish tradition. Jesus also observed this day of worship.

3. Passover: This is a week-long celebration that commemorates the deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. It is also a time for forgiveness and redemption.

4. Holy Days: There are several holy days in the Jewish calendar, including the Day of Pentecost, which is a time of prayer and repentance.

These cultural practices had an impact on early Christian practices as well. For example, Jesus and his followers observed the Sabbah and the Holy Days, and Jesus also taught about the importance of loving one's neighbor, which is a central teaching in the Bible. Additionally, Jesus' teachings about love and forgiveness are rooted in the Jewish tradition of the Passover.

Grade: 60%

Comment: The response provides some relevant information about Jewish cultural practices and how they influenced early Christian practices, which is partly addressed in the concern about cultural norms influencing faith communities and their practices. However, it does not directly address the main issue of Gentiles being avoided by Jews, as stated in the given answer. The response primarily focuses on Jewish practices that were observed by Jesus and his followers, without explicitly discussing the avoidance of Gentiles or its impact on early Christian practices.

To improve the response, it would be helpful to include a clear connection between the cultural practices discussed and how they relate to the initial concern about Gentiles being avoided.
