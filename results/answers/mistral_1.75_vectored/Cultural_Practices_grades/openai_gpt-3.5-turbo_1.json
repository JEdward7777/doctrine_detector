  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of how Jewish cultural practices influenced early Christian practices, particularly in relation to the chosen practices like circumcision, Sabbah, Passover, and holy days. The response effectively links these practices to the teachings and actions of Jesus. However, the response does not directly address the concern about how these cultural norms influenced the early church's discussions on inclusivity and acceptance of Gentiles, which was the specific focus of the question. A stronger connection to the concern raised would have improved the grade."
