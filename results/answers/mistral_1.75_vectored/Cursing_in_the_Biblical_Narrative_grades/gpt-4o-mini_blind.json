The student should delve deeper into the theological significance of the curse placed on the serpent in Genesis 3:14. They missed the opportunity to discuss the broader implications of the curse in terms of the enmity between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman, which ultimately points toward Christ's victory over sin and Satan. The answer could also benefit from more direct references to biblical passages that support their points. Additionally, there could be more clarity and precision in connecting the curse to the need for forgiveness and redemption. The student should seek to enhance their response with more specific theological insights and biblical references to strengthen their argument."
