However, it could be improved by emphasizing the aspect of self-denial, sacrifice, and willingness to endure suffering and persecution for the sake of Christ. Additionally, mentioning the importance of dying to self and surrendering one's will to God's will would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the explanation."
