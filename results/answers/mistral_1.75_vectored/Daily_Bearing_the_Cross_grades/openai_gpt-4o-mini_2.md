In the Bible, Jesus teaches his followers to "take up their cross" and follow him. This is a symbol of following Jesus' teachings and serving others, even if it means suffering and persecution. It is a call to be humble and servant-minded, to put others before ourselves and to love and serve others as Jesus loves and serves us. It also means to have faith and trust in Jesus and to follow His example of love and sacrifice.
