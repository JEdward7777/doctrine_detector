In Christian theology, the promise of David's throne being established forever is a symbol of Jesus Christ's eternal kingdom. The Bible teaches that Jesus is the true King of God and that He will always be with us until the end of time.

Comment: The student has provided a strong understanding of the significance of the promise of David's throne in Christian theology, focusing on Jesus Christ's eternal kingdom and His role as the true King of God. The student effectively connects this promise to Jesus' teachings, sacrificial love, and victory over sin and death. The answer aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly mention that the promise signifies that Jesus, as a descendant of David, will reign as king forever, in line with the Christian belief in Jesus' lineage from David.
