  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response touches on some aspects of the significance of the \"Day of the Lord\" in the New Testament, it lacks doctrinal correctness in two key areas. Firstly, the phrase \"Day of the Lord\" in the New Testament is predominantly associated with judgment and the second coming of Christ, rather than solely a time of joy and celebration. Secondly, the student did not mention the concept of God's wrath and the separation of the righteous from the unrighteous that is often emphasized in relation to the \"Day of the Lord.\" The response could have been strengthened by including these important doctrinal aspects."
