  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a fairly accurate understanding of the 'day of the Lord' in the New Testament, emphasizing the aspects of joy, celebration, judgment, and preparation for Jesus Christ's coming. However, the answer lacked a crucial element highlighted in the reference answer - that the 'day of the Lord' specifically signifies the return of the Lord Jesus to judge people at the end of time. By omitting this key point, the student's answer missed the central focus and significance of the term from a Christian worldview perspective."
