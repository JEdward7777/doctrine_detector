However, it could be improved by incorporating more specific references to biblical passages that outline the qualifications and responsibilities of deacons, such as 1 Timothy 3:8-13. Additionally, the mention of being servants of the Holy Spirit could be elaborated on with a deeper theological explanation of the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering and equipping deacons for their service."
