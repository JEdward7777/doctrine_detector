Comment: This answer provides a good overview of the primary role of a deacon in the local church, emphasizing service, support, and ministry. However, it could be improved by incorporating more specific references to biblical passages that outline the qualifications and responsibilities of deacons, such as 1 Timothy 3:8-13. Additionally, the mention of being servants of the Holy Spirit could be elaborated on with a deeper theological explanation of the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering and equipping deacons for their service.
