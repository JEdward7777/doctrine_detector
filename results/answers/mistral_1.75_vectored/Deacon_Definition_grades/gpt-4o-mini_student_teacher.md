Grade: 60

Comment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the general roles and responsibilities of a deacon in the local church, but it lacks a focus on the biblical role of servanthood. While the student mentions serving and supporting the Christian community, caring for the sick and the poor, and sharing the love of Christ, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes the practical aspect of meeting needs such as food or money, which is closely tied to the biblical concept of servanthood. To improve the answer, the student should have highlighted the importance of practical service and assistance in fulfilling the biblical role of a deacon as a servant leader in the church.
