  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church. It correctly identifies the primary role of a deacon as serving and supporting the Christian community. However, the answer could benefit from more specific examples or references to biblical passages that support the student's claims."
