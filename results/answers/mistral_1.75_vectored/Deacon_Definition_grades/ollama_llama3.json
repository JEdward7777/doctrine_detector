While serving practical needs is an important aspect of Christian service, it doesn't capture the full scope of a deacon's responsibilities as described in Scripture. The original response highlights the importance of spiritual support and guidance, which is also crucial for the well-being of the church. To better address this concern, the response could have included more biblical references and a broader understanding of a deacon's role."
