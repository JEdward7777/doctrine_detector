However, it could be improved by elaborating on the broader responsibilities and spiritual aspects of servanthood in the church, as outlined in the biblical role of a deacon. A deeper understanding of how servanthood encompasses more than just practical assistance would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
