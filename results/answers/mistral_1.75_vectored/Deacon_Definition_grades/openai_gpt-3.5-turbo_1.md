Comment: The response accurately identifies a key aspect of the role of a deacon in the local church, which is to help fellow believers with practical needs such as food or money. However, it could be improved by elaborating on the broader responsibilities and spiritual aspects of servanthood in the church, as outlined in the biblical role of a deacon. A deeper understanding of how servanthood encompasses more than just practical assistance would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
