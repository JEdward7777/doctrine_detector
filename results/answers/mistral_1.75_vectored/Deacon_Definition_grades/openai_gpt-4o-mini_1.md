Comment: The response correctly acknowledges a key aspect of the deacon's role in serving fellow believers with practical needs like food or money, which aligns with the biblical principle of servanthood in the church. However, it only focuses on one aspect of the deacon's role and does not fully elaborate on the broader responsibilities of deacons in serving the Christian community as a whole.
