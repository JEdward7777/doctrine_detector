  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response correctly acknowledges the practical aspect of serving others as a deacon in the local church by assisting with practical needs like food or money. However, it lacks depth in addressing the full scope of the biblical role of servanthood in the church, which also includes aspects such as prayer, worship, caring for the sick and the poor, and sharing the love of Christ. Encouragement to expand on this aspect would have strengthened the response further."
