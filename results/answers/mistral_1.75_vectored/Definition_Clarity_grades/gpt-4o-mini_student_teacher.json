  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of adultery in the Christian context, emphasizing the gravity of the sin and the importance of seeking forgiveness through Jesus Christ. However, there was a slight deviation in the definition provided compared to the reference answer in terms of explicitly mentioning that adultery involves a married person. Encouragement to be more precise in defining the sin of adultery according to Scripture would enhance the response."
