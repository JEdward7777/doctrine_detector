  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25/100\n\nComment: The student's response is excessively repetitive and lacks accuracy and depth in providing alternative translations for the term 'intercede' as used in Scripture. The majority of the answer provided does not offer accurate translations or alternative meanings for 'intercede'. It is important to focus on the actual meaning of the term and how it is used in Scripture, rather than repeating unrelated phrases. Additionally, the response lacks specific references to Scripture passages where the term 'intercede' is used, which is necessary for a complete and accurate understanding. The student should strive to provide concise and relevant alternative translations with appropriate scriptural support."
