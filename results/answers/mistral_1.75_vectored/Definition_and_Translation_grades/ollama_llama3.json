  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThis response does not effectively address the concern of helping to clarify the meaning and application of intercession in different contexts. The majority of the response is repetitive and focuses on emphasizing Jesus' presence and love, but it does not provide alternative translations for the term \"intercede\" that are relevant to understanding its meaning and application. Additionally, the response does not provide any insightful or practical examples of how intercession can be applied in different situations.\n\nComment: The response could benefit from more focus on providing clear and concise alternative translations for the term \"intercede\", as well as exploring how these translations can be applied in various contexts to deepen understanding and application of intercession."
