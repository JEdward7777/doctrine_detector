  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The response provided does not align with the given answer and concern. The response contains a long repetition of a statement about Jesus being our Lord and Savior, which does not relate to alternative translations of the term 'intercede' as provided in the answer. The focus should have been on clarifying the meaning and application of intercession in different contexts, which was not accomplished in the response."
