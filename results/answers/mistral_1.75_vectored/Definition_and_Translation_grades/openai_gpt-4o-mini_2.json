  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough list of alternative translations for the term 'intercede,' but it went beyond the scope of the given answer and concern. The excessive repetition of the same content towards the end also detracts from the overall clarity and cohesion of the response. To improve, focus on directly addressing the concern while maintaining conciseness and relevance."
