In the Bible, angels are described as messengers of God who are sent to help and protect people. They are also called "holy angels" and are considered to be heavenly beings who serve Jesus Christ. The primary role of angels in the Bible is to serve and obey God, and to help and protect those who follow Jesus Christ. This includes helping Christians to pray and worship, protecting them from harm, and guiding them on their spiritual journey. Angels are also described as being sent to bring peace and joy to those who receive them, and to help fulfill the will of God.

Comment: The answer provides a basic understanding of angels according to a Christian worldview. It correctly mentions angels as messengers of God, but it could have further emphasized that angels are created beings distinct from humans. Additionally, the role of angels should have been described more in line with their primary function of carrying out God's will and serving as agents of His divine purposes, rather than focusing solely on helping and protecting individuals. The mention of angels serving Jesus Christ is accurate, but it could have been elaborated on to emphasize their role in worshiping and glorifying God.
