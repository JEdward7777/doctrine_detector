However, it would have been helpful to mention the importance of repentance and surrendering to Christ as part of becoming a believer. Additionally, referencing the need for faith in Jesus' sacrifice for forgiveness of sins would have strengthened the answer. Overall, a solid understanding, but could have been more comprehensive in detailing the biblical criteria for being classified as a believer."
