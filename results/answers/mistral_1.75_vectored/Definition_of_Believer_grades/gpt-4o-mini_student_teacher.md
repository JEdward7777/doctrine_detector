Grade: 85

Comment: The student's answer provides a good understanding of believers in Christ according to the Bible, highlighting the importance of belief in Jesus Christ. However, the student included additional information about baptism and living out faith through love and service which are not directly related to the core definition of a believer as someone who believes in and relies on Jesus Christ as Savior. This additional information, while relevant in a broader discussion of faith, slightly detracts from the precise definition of a believer as per the reference answer.
