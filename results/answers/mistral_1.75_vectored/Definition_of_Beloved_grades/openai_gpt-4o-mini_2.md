In the Bible, "beloved" is a term used to express deep love and affection. It is used to refer to Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the "Beloved Savior" (John 3:16), and also to the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:4). The term is also used to refer to Christians who are loved and cherished by Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:7). In addition, it is used to refer to the early Christian church, which was called the "Holy Church beloved and obefulfillment of the Lord's commandments." (Ephesians 4:32)
