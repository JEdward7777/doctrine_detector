  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 90. \n\nThe student accurately describes the term \"church\" in the New Testament as referring to the Church of Jesus Christ and emphasizes its symbolic representation of the Christian community. Additionally, they correctly mention the concept of the church as the body of Christ and highlight its purpose as a place for worship, service, and mutual support among believers. \n\nThe only minor improvement could be to include a brief mention of the Greek word for \"church,\" which is \"ekklesia,\" and its meaning of a called-out assembly. This additional detail would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the term's original context."
