  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the New Testament's reference to \"church\" as the Christian community, but falls short in fully grasping the church's role beyond just being a local assembly or building. While it correctly identifies the church as the body of Christ and a symbol of the Christian community, it does not emphasize the church's role in worshiping and serving God, nor its importance in supporting one another. The response also lacks depth in its discussion of the church's purpose and significance beyond just being a physical gathering place.\n\nThe concern is partially addressed, as the response recognizes that \"church\" refers to something more than just a building, but it does not fully convey the idea that the church is meant to be a dynamic community of believers actively serving God and one another."
