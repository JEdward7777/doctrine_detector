  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The student provides a solid understanding of confession according to the Bible, emphasizing the aspects of acknowledging sin, seeking forgiveness through Jesus Christ, and confessing faith in Him. The answer correctly references Bible verses that support the importance of confession. However, the student could enhance the response by delving deeper into the concept of repentance and the role of confession in the believer's ongoing sanctification process. Incorporating more Scriptural references and theological depth would further strengthen the answer."
