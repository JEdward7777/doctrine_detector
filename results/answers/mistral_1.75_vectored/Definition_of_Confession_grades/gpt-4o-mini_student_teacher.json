  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of confession in the Bible, incorporating verses and teachings from the New Testament, they missed the primary focus of confessing as admitting or asserting the truth, whether about God or one's sins. The answer also lacks a direct reference to the specific concern of understanding the biblical context of confession.\n\nThe student demonstrated a good understanding of the broader concept of confession but could improve by including a more direct link to the core definition provided in the reference answer."
