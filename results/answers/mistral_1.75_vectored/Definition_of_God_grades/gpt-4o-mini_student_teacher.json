  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of characteristics and nature of God mentioned in the Bible, which is commendable. However, there are some inaccuracies and misinterpretations present in the response. It is important for the student to focus on the key attributes of God as defined in the Bible, such as His eternal nature, triune existence, righteousness, wisdom, holiness, sinlessness, justice, mercy, and love. The student's response could be improved by aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by accurately reflecting these essential attributes of God."
