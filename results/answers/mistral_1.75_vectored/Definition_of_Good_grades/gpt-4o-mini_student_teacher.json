  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the Biblical definition of 'good' and 'evil' in terms of loving and serving God, loving others, recognizing sin, and seeking forgiveness. However, the answer did not directly address the concern of understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making as explicitly outlined in the reference answer. The student could have linked their explanation more closely to practical guidance for daily decision-making based on the Biblical definitions provided."
