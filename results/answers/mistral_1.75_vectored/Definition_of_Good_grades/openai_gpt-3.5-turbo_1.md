## [Answer](../Definition_of_Good.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, the commandment to love and serve God is central to what it means to be good. The Bible also teaches that we should love our neighbors as ourselves, and that we should treat others with kindness and compassion. This includes loving our enemies and praying for those who persecute us.

In contrast, the Bible defines evil as anything that goes against God's will. This includes acts of violence, hatred, and sin. Jesus taught that the greatest commandment is to love God above all else, and that we should love our neighbor as ourselves. He also taught that we should forgive those who have wronged us and pray for those who have hurt us.

The Bible also teaches that we are all sinners and that we are all in need of forgiveness. We are called to repent of our sins and to turn to Jesus Christ for salvation.

In summary, the Biblical definition of 'good' is based on loving and serving God and loving our neighbors as ourselves. The Bible defines 'evil' as anything that goes against God's will, including acts of violence, hatred, and sin.
