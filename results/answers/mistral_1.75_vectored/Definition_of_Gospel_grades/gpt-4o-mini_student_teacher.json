  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response correctly defines the term \"gospel\" as \"good news\" and how it is understood in the context of the Bible. The student effectively highlights the teachings, life of Jesus Christ, and the message of salvation in their explanation. The only slight deviation from the reference answer was the mention of the specific books of the New Testament, which are not directly addressed. Overall, a strong understanding of the significance of the Gospel in Christian faith is demonstrated."
