Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term "gospel" as "good news" and its significance in Christian faith, specifically focusing on God's salvation through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross. It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the key theological aspect of the Gospel. Just a minor deduction for not mentioning the broader context of the teachings and life of Jesus Christ in relation to the Gospel message.
