Comment: The student correctly identifies that the term "Holy One" is used in the Bible to refer to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His holiness and servant leadership. However, the answer does not fully delve into the significance of the term throughout the entire Bible, specifically in the Old Testament where the term is also used to describe God the Father. Additionally, expanding on the implications of Jesus being the Holy One in terms of His divinity and role in salvation would have strengthened the response.
