The term "Holy One" is used to refer to Jesus Christ in the New Testament. It is a title that emphasizes Jesus' holiness and his role as a servant and servant-teacher. This title also highlights Jesus' mission to serve and love others, and to teach His followers to do the same. In the Bible, Jesus is referred to as the Holy One, who came to fulfill the prophets and to bring salvation to all people.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a fairly accurate explanation of the term "Holy One" in the Bible, emphasizing Jesus' holiness and His role in serving and teaching others. However, the student missed the important point that the term 'Holy One' primarily refers to God, highlighting His holiness. It would have been better to mention the significance of God's holiness and unique role as the 'Holy One of Israel' in the Old Testament. The answer showed a good understanding, but lacked a key point from the Christian worldview perspective.
