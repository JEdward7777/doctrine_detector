  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does accurately identify that \"Holy One\" is used to refer to both God and Jesus in scripture, which aligns with the correct answer. It also correctly highlights the emphasis on holiness and the unique role of the Holy One in scripture, particularly in fulfilling prophets' prophecies and bringing salvation.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. For example, it doesn't explicitly state that Jesus is specifically referred to as the Holy One, which would have added more specificity and clarity to the response. Additionally, while the response does touch on the idea of the Holy One's role in scripture, it could have delved deeper into the implications of this title for understanding God's character and our relationship with Him.\n\nOverall, I think the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of the Holy One, but could benefit from further development and nuance."
