  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a solid understanding of the term \"Holy One\" and correctly emphasized the holiness of God as well as linking it to Jesus in the New Testament. The concern regarding understanding the holiness of God and His unique role in scripture was addressed effectively. However, a slightly higher grade could be achieved by further expanding on how the holiness of God is reflected in Jesus as the Holy One in the New Testament."
