Grade: 70

Comment: The response provided a good explanation of how the term "Holy One" is used in the New Testament to refer to Jesus Christ, emphasizing His holiness and servanthood. However, there was a slight error in not explicitly acknowledging that the term "Holy One" primarily refers to God Himself in both the Old and New Testaments. Connecting Jesus' holiness to the holiness of God would have strengthened the argument from a Christian worldview perspective.
