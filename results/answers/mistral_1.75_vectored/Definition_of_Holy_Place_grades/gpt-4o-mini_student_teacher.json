  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response captures some aspects of the significance of the Holy Place in terms of God's presence, worship, and forgiveness, which are important aspects. However, the student's answer lacks specificity regarding the design and function of the Holy Place within the Tabernacle or Temple as outlined in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to provide more detailed and accurate information would help improve their understanding from a Christian worldview."
