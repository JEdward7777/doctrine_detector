  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of repentance in a Christian context, emphasizing the importance of recognizing sins, turning away from them, seeking forgiveness through Jesus Christ, and living a holy life. The response also touches on confession, renewal, and continuous growth. While the student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of repentance in Christianity, it slightly deviates from the reference answer by incorporating additional elements. It is important to ensure that the focus remains on the core concept of turning away from sin and turning back to God in discussions of repentance."
