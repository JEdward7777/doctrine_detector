  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe answer correctly identifies that in the New Testament, \"saints\" are followers of Jesus Christ called to be holy and obedient to God. It also mentions the early Christian martyrs and later additions to the Church as part of this group. However, to improve the grade, the answer could have elaborated more on the concept of sanctification and how saints are set apart for God's purposes. Additionally, emphasizing the role of Christ's work in believers' sanctification could have strengthened the doctrinal depth of the response."
