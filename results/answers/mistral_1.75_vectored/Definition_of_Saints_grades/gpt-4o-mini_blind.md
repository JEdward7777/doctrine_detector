## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the New Testament, "saints" refers to those who are followers of Jesus Christ and are called to be holy and obedient to God. This includes both the early Christian martyrs and those who were later added to the Church. The term is also used to refer to all believers who are called to live a holy life and follow Jesus Christ.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The answer correctly identifies that in the New Testament, "saints" are followers of Jesus Christ called to be holy and obedient to God. It also mentions the early Christian martyrs and later additions to the Church as part of this group. However, to improve the grade, the answer could have elaborated more on the concept of sanctification and how saints are set apart for God's purposes. Additionally, emphasizing the role of Christ's work in believers' sanctification could have strengthened the doctrinal depth of the response.
