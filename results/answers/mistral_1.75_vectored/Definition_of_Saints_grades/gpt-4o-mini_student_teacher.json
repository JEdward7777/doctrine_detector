  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85. The student correctly identifies that 'saints' in the New Testament refers to followers of Jesus Christ who are called to be holy and obedient to God. They acknowledge the idea that all believers are called to live a holy life and follow Jesus Christ. However, the student's answer could be improved by emphasizing the centrality of holiness in the definition of saints and by connecting the term more directly to its literal meaning of 'holy ones.' Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept but could refine their explanation to align more closely with the Biblical definition provided by the teacher."
