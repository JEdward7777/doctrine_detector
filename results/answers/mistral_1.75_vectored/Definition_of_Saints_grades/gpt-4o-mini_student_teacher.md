## Question [Definition of Saints](../../../questions/Definition_of_Saints.md)
What does the term 'saints' mean in the context of the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
The term 'saints' literally means 'holy ones' and refers to believers in Jesus.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints helps to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the New Testament, "saints" refers to those who are followers of Jesus Christ and are called to be holy and obedient to God. This includes both the early Christian martyrs and those who were later added to the Church. The term is also used to refer to all believers who are called to live a holy life and follow Jesus Christ.

85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 85. The student correctly identifies that 'saints' in the New Testament refers to followers of Jesus Christ who are called to be holy and obedient to God. They acknowledge the idea that all believers are called to live a holy life and follow Jesus Christ. However, the student's answer could be improved by emphasizing the centrality of holiness in the definition of saints and by connecting the term more directly to its literal meaning of 'holy ones.' Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept but could refine their explanation to align more closely with the Biblical definition provided by the teacher.
