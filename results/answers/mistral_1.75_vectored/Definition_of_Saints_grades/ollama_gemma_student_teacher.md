**Comment:** The student's answer accurately defines the Biblical definition of "saints" as believers in Jesus Christ. However, it could benefit from further clarification that the term "saints" is primarily used in the context of the New Testament to refer to those who are specifically recognized for their exceptional holiness and devotion to God.
