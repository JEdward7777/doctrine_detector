The explanation of sanctification as being set apart for a special purpose and involving prayer, reading the Bible, attending church, and living a pleasing life to God is accurate. The mention of receiving the Holy Spirit for guidance and empowerment is also commendable. However, it could be improved by delving deeper into the role of faith and repentance in sanctification, as well as mentioning the role of the Church community and sacraments in the sanctification process. Overall, a good explanation that could be enhanced with additional theological depth."
