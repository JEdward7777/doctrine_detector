  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 70.\n\nWhile the student does provide a solid understanding of sanctification as a process of becoming more like Jesus Christ and being filled with the Holy Spirit, they have included additional elements such as activities like prayer, reading the Bible, attending church, and living a life pleasing to God as integral parts of sanctification. While these activities can certainly aid in the sanctification process, the core definition of sanctification is primarily about being made holy and set apart.\n\nOverall, the student's answer demonstrates a good comprehension of the concept of sanctification from a Christian worldview, but could benefit from focusing more on the central idea of being made holy in alignment with the reference answer."
