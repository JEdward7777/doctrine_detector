Understanding the biblical definition of sanctification.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, sanctification is a process of becoming more like Jesus Christ and being filled with the Holy Spirit. It is a spiritual transformation that involves growing in love, obedience, and holiness.

To sanctify means to make someone holy or set apart for a special purpose. This can be done through prayer, reading the Bible, attending church, and living a life that is pleasing to God.

Being sanctified also involves receiving the Holy Spirit, who will guide and empower you to live a holy life. The Holy Spirit will help you to overcome sin and to grow in love and obedience to Jesus Christ.

In the Bible, sanctification is seen as a gift from God, and it is available to all believers who want to follow Jesus Christ and live a holy life.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's answer as 70.

While the student does provide a solid understanding of sanctification as a process of becoming more like Jesus Christ and being filled with the Holy Spirit, they have included additional elements such as activities like prayer, reading the Bible, attending church, and living a life pleasing to God as integral parts of sanctification. While these activities can certainly aid in the sanctification process, the core definition of sanctification is primarily about being made holy and set apart.

Overall, the student's answer demonstrates a good comprehension of the concept of sanctification from a Christian worldview, but could benefit from focusing more on the central idea of being made holy in alignment with the reference answer.
