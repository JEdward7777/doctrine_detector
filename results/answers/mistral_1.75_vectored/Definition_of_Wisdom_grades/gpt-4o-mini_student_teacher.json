  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of biblical wisdom, touching on key aspects such as God's role in granting wisdom, the connection between wisdom and obedience, and the practical demonstration of wisdom through acts of love and service. The response aligns well with the biblical perspective on wisdom and effectively emphasizes the importance of living out one's knowledge in accordance with God's will. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of wisdom to making decisions that align with God's will, as outlined in the concern provided."
