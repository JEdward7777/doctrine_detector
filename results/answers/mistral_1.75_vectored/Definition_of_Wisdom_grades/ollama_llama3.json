It also mentions the importance of living out one's knowledge in loving and serving others, which is consistent with the concern about aligning decisions with God's will. However, the response could be more detailed in exploring how wisdom is described as a gift from God and how it involves discernment, guidance, and protection. Additionally, while the response mentions obedience to God's commands and prayer as sources of wisdom, it does not explicitly tie these elements back to the concern about making decisions that align with God's will.\n\nThe student's answer, which defines wisdom as understanding what is right and moral, pleasing God, and practicing what is true and morally right, is generally consistent with the biblical concept of wisdom.
