It aligns well with the biblical concept of wisdom as a gift from God that involves understanding and applying God's teachings. However, it could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning the importance of obedience to God's commands and prayer, which are key aspects emphasized in the Bible for attaining wisdom and making decisions in alignment with God's will."
