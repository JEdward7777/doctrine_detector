  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has a good understanding of miracles in relation to God's authority and the significance of Jesus' miracles in the Christian tradition. However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies, such as referring to Jesus as the Holy Spirit, which may cause confusion. Additionally, more emphasis could be placed on the sovereignty of God in performing miracles and the role of faith in encountering them. Overall, the answer provides a solid foundation but lacks some precision in theological concepts."
