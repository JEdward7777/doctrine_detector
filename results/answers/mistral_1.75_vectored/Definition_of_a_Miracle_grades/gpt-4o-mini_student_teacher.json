  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of miracles within a Christian worldview, emphasizing how miracles are manifestations of divine love, forgiveness, and healing. The student effectively connects miracles to Jesus Christ's ministry and the significance of his miracles as demonstrations of authority and fulfillment of prophecy. However, the student could improve by focusing more on the concept of God's intervention as the primary aspect of miracles, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a solid understanding of miracles and their relation to God's authority is demonstrated in the response."
