  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive explanation of miracles within a Christian framework by emphasizing the divine nature of miracles as acts of God's love, forgiveness, and healing. It effectively connects the concept of miracles to Jesus Christ's ministry and the continuation of divine intervention through the Holy Spirit in sacraments. The response addresses the concern by illustrating how understanding miracles can indeed deepen faith and recognize God's power. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more direct scriptural references to enhance the biblical foundation of the explanation."
