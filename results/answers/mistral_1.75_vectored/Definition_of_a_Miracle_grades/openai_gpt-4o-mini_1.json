The incorporation of the belief in the Holy Spirit's ongoing work through sacraments further strengthens the understanding of miracles as instruments of God's power and grace. This response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how miracles can deepen faith and lead to a greater acknowledgment of God's power. Great job overall."
