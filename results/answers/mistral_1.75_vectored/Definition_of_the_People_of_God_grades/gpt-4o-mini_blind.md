In the Old Testament, "people of God" refers to those who are chosen by God to be part of His covenant and to follow Him. This includes both Jews and Gentiles who have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. The people of God are called to live according to the teachings of the Bible and to serve God in love and obedience. They are also called to share the Gospel with others and to spread the love of Jesus Christ to all people.

Comments: The answer provides a somewhat accurate overview of being part of the "people of God" in the Old Testament, emphasizing being chosen by God and following Him. However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies. The concept of being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ specifically applies to the New Testament era rather than the Old Testament. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the historical and theological implications of being God's chosen people in the Old Testament. Additionally, the role of Gentiles in the Old Testament covenant may need more nuance and clarification.
