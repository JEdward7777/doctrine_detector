It correctly points out that this includes both Jews and Gentiles who have accepted Jesus Christ. However, the answer lacks nuance and fails to address the specific concern of understanding the covenant relationship God established with Israel. \n\nWhile it is true that the people of God are called to live according to the Bible and serve God, the answer doesn't elaborate on the unique covenantal relationship established with Israel as God's chosen nation. The answer also overlooks the significance of Israel's obedience and faithfulness in fulfilling their role as the people of God.\n\nOverall, the answer provides a solid understanding of the general concept of the \"people of God\" but lacks depth in addressing the specific concern related to the covenant relationship with Israel."
