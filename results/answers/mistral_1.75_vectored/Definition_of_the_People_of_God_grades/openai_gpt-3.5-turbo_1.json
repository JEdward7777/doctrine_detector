While this perspective reflects the inclusiveness of God's covenant relationship through Jesus, there could be further clarity in connecting this expansion to the understanding of the covenant relationship God established with Israel in the Old Testament. The response could have emphasized the continuation and fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel through Jesus Christ more explicitly."
