## [Answer](../Definition_of_the_People_of_God.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Old Testament, "people of God" refers to those who are chosen by God to be part of His covenant and to follow Him. This includes both Jews and Gentiles who have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. The people of God are called to live according to the teachings of the Bible and to serve God in love and obedience. They are also called to share the Gospel with others and to spread the love of Jesus Christ to all people.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provided expands on the definition of the "people of God" beyond just the nation of Israel to include Jews and Gentiles who have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. While this perspective reflects the inclusiveness of God's covenant relationship through Jesus, there could be further clarity in connecting this expansion to the understanding of the covenant relationship God established with Israel in the Old Testament. The response could have emphasized the continuation and fulfillment of God's covenant with Israel through Jesus Christ more explicitly.
