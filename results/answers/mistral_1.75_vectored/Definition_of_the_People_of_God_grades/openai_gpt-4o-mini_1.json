  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately reflects that in the Old Testament, the \"people of God\" primarily refers to the nation of Israel, chosen by God for a covenant relationship. However, the grading is slightly lower due to the lack of emphasis on the specific covenant relationship and its terms, as well as the absence of a clear distinction between the Old and New Testament concepts of the \"people of God.\" Adding more detail on the covenant relationship and how it differs from the New Testament understanding would have strengthened the response further."
