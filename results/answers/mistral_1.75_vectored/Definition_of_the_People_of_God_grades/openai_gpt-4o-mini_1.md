## [Answer](../Definition_of_the_People_of_God.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Old Testament, "people of God" refers to those who are chosen by God to be part of His covenant and to follow Him. This includes both Jews and Gentiles who have been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. The people of God are called to live according to the teachings of the Bible and to serve God in love and obedience. They are also called to share the Gospel with others and to spread the love of Jesus Christ to all people.

80.0

## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_1.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately reflects that in the Old Testament, the "people of God" primarily refers to the nation of Israel, chosen by God for a covenant relationship. However, the grading is slightly lower due to the lack of emphasis on the specific covenant relationship and its terms, as well as the absence of a clear distinction between the Old and New Testament concepts of the "people of God." Adding more detail on the covenant relationship and how it differs from the New Testament understanding would have strengthened the response further.
