  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies the \"people of God\" in the Old Testament as the nation of Israel, chosen by God to serve and obey Him. The explanation provided aligns well with the concern of understanding the covenant relationship God established with Israel. The response could have elaborated more on the specific terms of the covenant and the responsibilities of Israel within it to receive a higher grade."
