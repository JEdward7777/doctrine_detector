  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: \n\n1. The response lacks doctrinal correctness on the nature of demon possession according to the Bible. Demon possession is not a means for God to test or bless individuals. Demons seek to harm and destroy, not fulfill the will of God (1 Peter 5:8).\n\n2. There is an inaccurate attribution of specific biblical references. For example, the mention of casting out seven demons into seven people is not found in Luke 4:1-16.\n\n3. The response could benefit from clearer explanation on the distinction between physical/mental illness and demonic possession according to Christian beliefs.\n\n4. It is commendable that the student emphasized seeking help from Christian leaders or counselors, as well as the importance of prayer and healing."
