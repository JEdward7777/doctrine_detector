Exhort, encourage, and admonish are all Christian commands to help people live a holy life. However, there are some important differences between these three commands:

1. Exhort is a command to encourage and strengthen one another in the faith. It is meant to be done in love and with a desire to help others grow in their faith. For example, "Let us therefore pray for one another that we may have peace and love and joy in the Holy Spirit." (Ephesians 6:7).

2. Encourage is also a command to help and uplift one another in the faith. It is meant to be done in love and with a desire to help others grow in their faith. For example, "Let us therefore encourage one another and make it our prayer that we may be filled of the Holy Spirit." (Acts 2:46).

3. Admonish is a command to warn and instruct one another in the faith. It is meant to be done in love and with a desire to help others grow in their faith. For example, "And let us pray for one another that we may have the spirit of Jesus Christ that will enable us to love and forgive anyone who has a spirit of love and forgiveness. And we will pray for you that the Lord will fill you with the Holy Spirit that will enable you to love and forgive anyone who has a spirit of love and forgiveness.‚Äù (Ephesians 2:7-8).

In summary, all three commands are meant to help people grow in their faith, but they are different in their specific focus. Exhort and encourage are focused on encouraging and strengthening one another in the faith, while admonish is focused on warning and instructing one another in the faith.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student has a decent understanding of the meanings of the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' within a Christian context. However, the examples provided are a bit repetitive and lack depth. Additionally, there is room for improvement in explaining the nuances and specific application of each term. The response could benefit from more clarity and expansion on how each command is distinct in its purpose and approach.
