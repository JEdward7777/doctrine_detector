  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided some good insights into the meanings of exhort, encourage, and admonish within a Christian context. However, the student's response lacked precision and accuracy in defining the terms according to scripture. The reference answer from the teacher clearly outlined the specific meanings of each term based on Biblical understanding, which the student did not fully reflect. The student's response could have been improved by citing specific passages from the Bible that illustrate the differences between these terms."
