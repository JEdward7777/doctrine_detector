  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the definitions of each term, which meets the concern of clarifying their meanings. However, it does not fully address the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. The response mainly focuses on the differences between exhort, encourage, and admonish without providing specific biblical examples or applications.\n\nThe response also includes some unclear phrases, such as \"with a desire to help others grow in their faith,\" which could be improved with more concrete examples from Scripture. Additionally, the use of quotes from Ephesians 6:7, Acts 2:46, and Ephesians 2:7-8 seems somewhat forced and does not necessarily illustrate the correct use of exhort, encourage, or admonish.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a good foundation for understanding the meanings of these terms, it could be improved with more specific biblical examples and applications."
