The scriptural references provided are supportive of the definitions given. However, the response could benefit from more explicit references to how these forms of encouragement should be applied according to Christian teachings, such as emphasizing the importance of speaking the truth in love and being led by the Holy Spirit in offering exhortation, encouragement, and admonishment."
