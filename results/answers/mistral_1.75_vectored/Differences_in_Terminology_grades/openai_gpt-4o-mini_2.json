It effectively clarified the differences between these commands and their intentions. However, there was room for improvement in directly addressing the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. The response could have incorporated more direct references to scriptural guidance on when to exhort, encourage, or admonish based on specific situations or contexts."
