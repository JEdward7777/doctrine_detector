However, the response could be improved by including more emphasis on the specific scriptural reasons why the twelve apostles were chosen, such as their role in spreading the Gospel and establishing the early church. Additionally, mentioning the significance of their individual relationships with Jesus and their subsequent mission to preach the Good News would enhance the answer. "
