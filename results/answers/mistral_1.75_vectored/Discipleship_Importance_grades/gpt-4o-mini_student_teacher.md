Comment: The student's answer accurately mentions that the apostles were chosen to spread Jesus' teachings, but they missed the key point about establishing the foundation of the early Church, which is crucial in understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament from a Christian worldview. The student's response could have been stronger by elaborating more on the specific purpose and authority given to the apostles by Jesus.
