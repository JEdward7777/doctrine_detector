## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response as 85.

The student provides some accurate information about the apostles, such as their role as Jesus' closest disciples and missionaries, as well as their connection to the twelve tribes of Israel. They also touch on the importance of spreading Jesus' teachings and establishing the early Church.

However, the student's understanding of the apostles' significance is not entirely clear. While they mention the apostles being chosen by Jesus for a specific purpose, they do not explicitly state what that purpose was or how it relates to the establishment of the Church. Additionally, their response does not demonstrate a deep understanding of the biblical prophecies and fulfillment fulfilled through the apostles.

Overall, while the student's response is generally accurate and shows some understanding of the role of the apostles, it could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation.
