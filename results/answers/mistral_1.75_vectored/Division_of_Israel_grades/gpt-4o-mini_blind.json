In fact, there were many events and several centuries that occurred between Solomon's reign and the birth of Jesus Christ, including the division of Israel into the northern and southern kingdoms, the Babylonian exile, and the return of the exiles under Persian rule. It's important to accurately connect historical events within the biblical timeline."
