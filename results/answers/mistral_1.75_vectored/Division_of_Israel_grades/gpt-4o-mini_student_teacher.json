  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer is factually incorrect and does not address the historical significance of the division of the Israelites after King Solomon's reign. The focus on Jesus Christ's birth, while significant in Christian theology, is not directly related to the division of the Israelites into the northern and southern kingdoms. The student should provide a more accurate and relevant response within the context of Israel's history."
