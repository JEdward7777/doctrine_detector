The mention of spreading love and blessings aligns well with encouraging Christians to live out their faith through good deeds. The response could have included a specific reference to biblical teachings or stories that support this concept to strengthen the argument further. Overall, a solid understanding and application of Christian principles in the context of doing good deeds."
