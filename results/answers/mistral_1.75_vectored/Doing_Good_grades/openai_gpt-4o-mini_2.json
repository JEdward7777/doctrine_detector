It aligns well with the concern of encouraging Christians to live out their faith in practical ways. The integration of scripture (e.g., \"Love one another, just as I loved you\") adds depth to the Christian perspective. It could have been strengthened by incorporating more specific examples of what \"doing good to others\" looks like in daily life."
