Comment: The response provides a solid foundation by emphasizing the importance of actively benefiting others, being kind, and reflecting Christ's love through good deeds. It aligns well with the concern of encouraging Christians to live out their faith in practical ways. The integration of scripture (e.g., "Love one another, just as I loved you") adds depth to the Christian perspective. It could have been strengthened by incorporating more specific examples of what "doing good to others" looks like in daily life.
