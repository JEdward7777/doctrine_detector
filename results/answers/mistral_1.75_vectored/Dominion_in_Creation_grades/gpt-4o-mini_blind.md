## [Answer](../Dominion_in_Creation.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that God gave humans a special blessing to be stewards and caretakers of the earth. This is found in Genesis 1:27, where it says "So God blessed me (Jesus) and made me a blessing to all people, to make them holy and help me fulfill my mission to be a servant to all people. Jesus said, 'I am also sent to fulfill this mission.'"

In Matthew 28:19-20, Jesus commands his followers to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Holy Spirit, and of Jesus Christ. He also commands them to teach them to love and serve others, and to make them a blessing to others.

In Luke 22:36, Jesus teaches his followers to pray for those who persecuted him, saying "I want you to be filled with the Holy Spirit, so that you can help me fulfill what I command you to do."

These verses show that Jesus wants us to use our gifts and talents to serve others and to spread the love of Jesus to all people. We are called to be a blessing to others, to love and serve them, and to help fulfill the mission of Jesus to bring salvation to all people.
