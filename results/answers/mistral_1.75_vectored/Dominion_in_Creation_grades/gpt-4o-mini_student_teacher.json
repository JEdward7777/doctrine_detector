  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some relevant biblical references, but they misinterpret the verses and fail to provide a clear understanding of humanity's role in having dominion over the earth. The student's response lacks a proper explanation of stewardship and responsibility in caring for creation as outlined in the Bible. More focused and accurate interpretation of relevant scriptures is needed to address the concern effectively."
