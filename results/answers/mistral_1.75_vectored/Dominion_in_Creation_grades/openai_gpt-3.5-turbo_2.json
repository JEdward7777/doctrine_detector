  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of our God-given authority over creation as stewards and caretakers, referencing relevant Bible verses to support the argument. The student effectively connects the responsibility to manage and care for creation with the Christian worldview of serving and spreading love to others. However, there is a minor inconsistency in attributing direct quotes to Jesus that are not found in the referenced Bible verses. Overall, a solid understanding and application of Christian principles to responsible stewardship of creation."
