  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response correctly references the Bible and acknowledges the responsibility given to humans to be stewards of creation. However, there are inaccuracies in attributing specific verses and misquoting Jesus. The response does not fully address the concern of understanding our God-given authority over creation and how to exercise it responsibly. More precise biblical references and a deeper exploration of stewardship principles are needed for a higher grade."
