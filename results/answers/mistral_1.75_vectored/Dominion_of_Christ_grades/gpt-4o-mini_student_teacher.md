Comment: The student's answer provides a good overview of how Jesus Christ's dominion is described in the Bible, emphasizing his eternal and authoritative nature, as well as his role as Savior. However, the student could enhance their answer by explicitly mentioning Jesus as prophet, priest, and king, as indicated in the reference answer. This deeper understanding of Christ's roles and authority would strengthen the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective.
