  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately describes Jesus Christ's dominion as eternal and everlasting, referencing him as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. It also highlights his authority over all things and his role as the Savior of the world. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on Jesus Christ's dominion as prophet, priest, and king, as per the reference answer."
