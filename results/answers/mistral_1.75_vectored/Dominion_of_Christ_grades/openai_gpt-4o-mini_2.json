The mention of Jesus being referred to as the King of Kings, the Son of God, and the Savior of the world aligns well with the concern of recognizing Christ's authority in all aspects of life and its impact on our faith. The use of Biblical references enhances the perspective from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
