**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** 
While the student's answer correctly states that the exact duration of "the last days" is not specified in the Bible, it does not address the specific concern raised in the prompt, which is the uncertainty surrounding this event and its impact on Christian living. The response could benefit from further elaboration on the biblical passages that speak to the signs and seasons of the end times, and how Christians are called to respond in faith and obedience amidst such uncertainty.
