Comment: The response correctly acknowledges the unknown duration of "the last days" according to the Bible. However, the concern raised about this uncertainty impacting how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return is not fully addressed. A stronger connection could be made between the lack of specific duration and the encouragement for Christians to remain vigilant and faithful in their beliefs and actions.
