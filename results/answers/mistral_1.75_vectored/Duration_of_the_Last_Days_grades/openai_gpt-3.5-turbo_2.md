Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the duration of "the last days" according to the Bible. However, it fails to address the concern raised about how this uncertainty can impact how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. A stronger response would have delved into how Christians should remain vigilant, spiritually prepared, and actively engaged in spreading the love of Christ despite not knowing the exact duration of these eschatological times.
