Comment: While the response accurately acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the duration of "the last days" in the Bible, it fails to address the concern raised about how this uncertainty can affect how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return. A stronger response would have emphasized the importance of remaining vigilant, faithful, and prepared for Christ's return regardless of the unknown duration of the last days.
