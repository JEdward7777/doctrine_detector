  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of ways in which the Holy Spirit empowers Christians according to Biblical references. However, the answer lacks a cohesive focus on the key aspects of leading, teaching, comforting, and enabling for proclaiming the Gospel and living according to God's will as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could benefit from emphasizing the central themes of the Holy Spirit's empowerment in a more concise and focused manner."
