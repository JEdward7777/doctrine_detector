It demonstrates a solid understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in guiding, protecting, enabling, and empowering believers for ministry. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of awareness of the Holy Spirit's empowerment for effective ministry and living out one's faith. However, a stronger connection could be made between the listed ways of empowerment and the need for Christians to be aware of them in order to minister effectively, which would further enhance the response."
