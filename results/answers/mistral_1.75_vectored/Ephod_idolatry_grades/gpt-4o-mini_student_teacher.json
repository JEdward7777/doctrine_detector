  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer captures the importance of obedience and humility in the context of Gideon's actions and the subsequent idolatry of the Israelites. They correctly highlight the consequences of Gideon's pride and deviation from God's ways. However, the answer could have been more focused on the specific concern provided, which is the importance of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith. The reference answer emphasizes the potential for objects of worship to become idols, which the student's response does touch upon but could have delved into more deeply."
