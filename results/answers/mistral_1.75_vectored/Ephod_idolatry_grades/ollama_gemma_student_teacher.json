  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the main concern and provides a thoughtful analysis of the story of Gideon and the Israelites. The student correctly identifies the root cause of the idolatry as Gideon's pride and desire for independence, and connects it to the broader theme of humility and obedience in following God's guidance. The conclusion effectively highlights the potential for material objects to become idols if their significance is misconstrued."
