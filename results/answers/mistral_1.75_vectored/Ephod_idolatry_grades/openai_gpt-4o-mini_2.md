## [Answer](../Ephod_idolatry.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The story of Gideon creating a gold ephod and the subsequent idolatry of the Israelites teaches us about the importance of humility and obedience. Gideon was meant to be a servant of God, but he became proud and wanted to do things his own way. He created a golden ephron to help him make decisions, which was a sinful act that led to the Israelites becoming idolized. This story reminds us that we must always put our trust in God and seek His guidance in all things. We must also remember that pride and greed can lead us astray and cause us to stray from the path of righteousness.
