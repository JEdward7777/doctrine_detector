The mention of silk, cherry wood, and love as materials used in the ephod is not supported biblically. It would be beneficial for the student to study the specific materials mentioned in the Bible in relation to the ephod. Additionally, the repeated emphasis on silver and gold as symbols of Jesus Christ's sacrifice and love, while well-intentioned, could be misleading as the primary significance of these materials in the ephod was for their physical properties and symbolism within the context of the Old Testament priesthood."
