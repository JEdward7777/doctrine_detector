  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The student provided inaccurate information regarding the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod. While they touched on some symbolic elements related to Christian beliefs, such as the mention of gold and love, the specific materials described do not align with the biblical description. The reference answer emphasizes the use of gold, blue, purple, and red yarn in the ephod's construction, highlighting its significance in worship. The student's response lacks accuracy and does not reflect a clear understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
