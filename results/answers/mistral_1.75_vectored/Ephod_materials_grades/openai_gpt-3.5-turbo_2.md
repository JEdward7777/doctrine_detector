1. Lamb's wool: The ephron was made from lamb's wool, which was considered holy and pure.

2. Silk: The ephron also contained silk, which was another symbol of purity and love.

3. Gold: The ephron was also made with gold, which was a symbol of Jesus Christ's sacrifice and love for us.

4. Silver: The ephron also contained silver, which was another symbol of Jesus Christ's sacrifice and love for us.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides some additional information about the materials used in the ephod, emphasizing their symbolism in a Christian context. While the added details about lamb's wool, silk, gold, silver, cherry wood, and love are interesting, they do not accurately align with the biblical description of the ephod. The explanation lacks accuracy and coherence with the original answer provided, as well as a thorough understanding of the ephod's significance in worship.
