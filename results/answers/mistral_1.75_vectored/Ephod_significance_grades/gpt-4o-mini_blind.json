However, there are several inaccuracies in the interpretation provided. The ephod was not specifically a symbol of Christ's sacrificial love, but rather a piece of the high priest's attire used for divination and decision-making. The reference to the ephod as a symbol of the Holy Spirit is not supported by biblical evidence, as the Holy Spirit's role is distinct from the ephod's function. Additionally, the ephod was not worn by the people of Israel for prayer and intercession, but specifically by the high priest. The student should strive for more accurate biblical understanding and theological interpretation in their responses."
