  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides some relevant information about the ephod, such as its symbolism and importance in prayer and intercession. However, the answer lacks specificity on the actual significance of the ephod in the context of Old Testament worship as it primarily focuses on spiritual symbolism. The key aspect of the ephod representing the high priest's role in mediating between God and the people, as well as the function of the attached breastpiece with the Urim and Thummim for discerning God's will, is not adequately addressed. The response would benefit from a deeper exploration of the ephod's practical and theological role in Old Testament worship."
