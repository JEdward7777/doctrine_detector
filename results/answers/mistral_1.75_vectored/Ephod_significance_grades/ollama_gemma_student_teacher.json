  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of the high priest's ephod in Old Testament worship. The student correctly identifies its role as a symbol of Christ's sacrifice and the importance of prayer and intercession. Additionally, the student provides insightful interpretations of the ephod as a symbol of the Holy Spirit's presence and power. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from greater precision in aligning the ephod's significance with the specific concern mentioned in the grading criteria. The reference answer highlights the mediating role of the ephod between God and the people, and the inclusion of the Urim and Thummim for discerning God's will. The student's answer does not explicitly address these aspects."
