However, the inclusion of additional aspects such as the symbolism of Christ's sacrificial love and the Holy Spirit in the response deviates from the specific concern of understanding the ephod in the context of Old Testament priesthood and worship practices. While the expanded information is insightful, it detracts somewhat from directly addressing the concern provided."
