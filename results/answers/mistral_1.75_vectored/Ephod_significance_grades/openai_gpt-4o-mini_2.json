However, there was a blending of Christian and Old Testament perspectives in the initial response, which may lead to some confusion. The explanation lacked a clear distinction between the Christian interpretation and the Old Testament practices, which could potentially muddy the understanding of the ephod's role in Old Testament priesthood and worship practices."
