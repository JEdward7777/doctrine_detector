  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComments: The answer provided contains a mix of jumbled Bible verses and repetitive content, making it difficult to follow and understand the message being conveyed. The response lacks coherence and clarity, which are important elements when discussing theological concepts. Furthermore, the explanation of eternal consequences for those who are perishing is vague and lacks depth. The student should focus on improving organization, coherence, and providing a more in-depth explanation supported by relevant biblical references in future responses."
