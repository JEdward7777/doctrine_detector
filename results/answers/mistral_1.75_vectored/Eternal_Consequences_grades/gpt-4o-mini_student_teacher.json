  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some relevant Bible verses and teachings, but it lacks clear focus on the eternal consequences for those who are described as \"perishing.\" The excessive repetition of certain phrases detracts from the overall clarity and coherence of the response. The student should provide a more direct and concise explanation regarding the eternal separation from God and the consequences of perishing based on the Christian worldview."
