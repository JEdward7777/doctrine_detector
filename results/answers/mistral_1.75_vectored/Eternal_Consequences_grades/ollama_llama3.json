  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 30.\n\nThe reason for this low grade is that the response does not adequately address the concern about understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God. While it mentions eternal consequences, including hell, it does not provide sufficient biblical support or explanation to help readers grasp the gravity of such a fate. The repetition of phrases like \"I will make all things new\" also distracts from the main point and makes the response seem more focused on spiritual experiences rather than the serious reality of eternal separation.\n\nAdditionally, the response could be improved by providing a clearer definition of what it means to \"perish\" and how this relates to one's relationship with God. By addressing these areas, the response would better meet the concern about understanding the seriousness of eternal separation from God."
