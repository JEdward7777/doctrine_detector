It also highlights the unique role of Jesus as Savior. However, it could be improved by discussing more explicitly the concept of Jesus as the second person of the Holy Trinity, emphasizing the orthodox Christian understanding of the Son's eternal relationship with the Father. Additionally, incorporating scriptural references or traditional theological language could strengthen the response further."
