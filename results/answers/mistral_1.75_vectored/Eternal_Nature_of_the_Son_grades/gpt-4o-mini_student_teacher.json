  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a fairly accurate understanding of Jesus as the Son of God and emphasizes his divine nature and role as savior. However, the student did not address the specific concern of emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God. The reference answer emphasizes the eternal existence of the Son of God and his active role in creation, which the student failed to highlight in their response."
