  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern of emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God. It correctly highlights that Jesus is believed to be the Son of God in both his divine nature and as a member of the Holy Trinity. Additionally, the response acknowledges Jesus' role as a savior, which is significant in Christian theology. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the unique aspect of Jesus' eternal existence compared to human sons."
