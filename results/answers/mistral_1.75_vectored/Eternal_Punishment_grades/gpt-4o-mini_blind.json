  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45/100\n\nComment: The response provided does not directly address the concept of eternal punishment in hell. It discusses the concept of eternal life in heaven and God's love and justice in offering salvation through Jesus Christ, but it does not engage with the question of how eternal punishment in hell reflects God's justice. The student should focus on directly answering the question asked and provide a more specific explanation of how the concept of eternal punishment in hell aligns with God's justice within Christian doctrine."
