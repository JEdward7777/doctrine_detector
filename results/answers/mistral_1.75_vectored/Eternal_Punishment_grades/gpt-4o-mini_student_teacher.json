  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer does not directly address the concept of eternal punishment in hell for those who do not believe in Jesus' sacrifice. While the student mentions God's love and the offer of eternal life through Jesus, they do not adequately address the aspect of justice in responding to rebellion and rejection of salvation. The importance of acknowledging the consequences of rejecting Jesus in the context of divine justice and mercy is missing from the response."
