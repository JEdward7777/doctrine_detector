  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern about divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences by emphasizing God's love and desire to bless His people with eternal life, while also acknowledging His justice in protecting them from sin. The mention of Jesus' sacrifice and death for our sins as a demonstration of God's love is particularly strong. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved:\n\n* While the response mentions eternal punishment in heaven, it does not explicitly discuss hell or the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to those who do not believe in Jesus' sacrifice.\n* The response could benefit from further development on how God's love and justice intersect in regards to eternal consequences. For example, it may be helpful to explore how God's justice is reflected in His desire to separate Himself from sin and rebellion.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences, but could be strengthened with additional exploration of these themes."
