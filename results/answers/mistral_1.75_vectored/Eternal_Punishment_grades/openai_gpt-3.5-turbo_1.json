The incorporation of Jesus' sacrifice as the means of salvation adds depth to the explanation and emphasizes the importance of accepting Him as Lord and Savior for the gift of eternal life. While the response could have explored the balance between justice and mercy further, it provides a solid Christian worldview perspective on the issue."
