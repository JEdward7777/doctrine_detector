  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response successfully addresses the concern about divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences by explaining the concept of eternal punishment in heaven as a reflection of God's love and justice. It emphasizes the importance of accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior for receiving eternal life, linking it to the idea of God's justice in responding to rebellion and rejection of His salvation plan. The response effectively integrates Christian beliefs about sin, redemption through Jesus' sacrifice, and the consequences of disbelief in a coherent and thoughtful manner."
