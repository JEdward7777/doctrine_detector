It appropriately addresses the concern about divine justice in relation to eternal consequences. The explanation given aligns well with a Christian worldview perspective on the consequences of rejecting Jesus' sacrifice. However, there could have been more emphasis on God's mercy and the opportunity for repentance even in the face of eternal punishment. This would have provided a more balanced view considering the notion of divine justice and mercy."
