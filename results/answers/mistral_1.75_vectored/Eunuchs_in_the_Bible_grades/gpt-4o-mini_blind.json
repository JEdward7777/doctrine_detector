  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks coherence and is heavily repetitive. They have not addressed the question about the meaning of eunuchs in Matthew 19:12 or how it relates to the concept of celibacy. The response is filled with repetitive phrases and does not exhibit an understanding of the passage or the question posed. Additionally, the content seems to be copied multiple times, which shows a lack of effort or understanding."
