The continuous repetition in their answer displays a lack of understanding of the biblical passage and the concept of celibacy. It fails to address the different reasons for living a life without marriage as outlined in the reference answer. They need to focus on providing a clear and concise explanation based on the biblical context and teachings on celibacy."
