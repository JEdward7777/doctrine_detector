## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:**

The student's answer correctly identifies the different categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus in Matthew 19:12. However, the response lacks clarity and depth in explaining the relevance of these categories to the concept of celibacy. The student's attempt to list numerous repetitions of the Holy Gospel phrase does not directly address the concern related to the biblical perspective on celibacy. The response could benefit from a more nuanced and theological analysis of the passage.
