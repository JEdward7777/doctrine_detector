While Jesus does mention eunuchs in Matthew 19:12, the repeated phrase \"to fulfill the Holy Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ\" is not relevant to the topic and makes it difficult to understand the original message. The response also does not provide any biblical context or explanation for the different types of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus. To address this concern, a more accurate and comprehensive response would be necessary."
