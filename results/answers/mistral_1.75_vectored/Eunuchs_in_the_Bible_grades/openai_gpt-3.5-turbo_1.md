Grade: 60

Comment: The response started with a relevant Bible verse but unfortunately veered off into repetitiveness and lost focus on the concern of understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy and the reasons for living a life without marriage.

Improvements can be made by expanding on the biblical reasons for celibacy and how it aligns with Christian beliefs and values.
