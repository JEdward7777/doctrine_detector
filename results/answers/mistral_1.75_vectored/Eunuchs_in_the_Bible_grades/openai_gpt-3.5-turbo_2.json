  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response does correctly reference the verse in Matthew 19:12 where Jesus mentions the different reasons for celibacy, including being born a eunuch. However, the repetition in the answer given detracts from the coherence and clarity of the response. It would have been more effective to provide a concise explanation of Jesus' teaching on celibacy rather than repeating the same phrase multiple times. Nonetheless, the biblical perspective on celibacy and the reasons for living a celibate life were correctly addressed."
