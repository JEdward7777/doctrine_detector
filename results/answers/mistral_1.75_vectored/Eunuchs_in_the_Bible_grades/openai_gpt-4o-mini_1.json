  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The provided response is unrelated to the concern about understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy and the reasons for living a life without marriage. The response given is repetitive and does not address the concern effectively. A clearer explanation of celibacy in biblical context and the reasons behind such a choice would have been more appropriate."
