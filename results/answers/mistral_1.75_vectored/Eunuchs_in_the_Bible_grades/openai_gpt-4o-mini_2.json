  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The provided response effectively references Matthew 19:12 and accurately summarizes Jesus' teachings on eunuchs, highlighting the three categories mentioned - those born as eunuchs, those made eunuchs by others, and those who choose celibacy for the kingdom of heaven. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and the various reasons for choosing a life without marriage. The excessive repetition in the initial quoted text should be noted as it detracts from the clarity of the response."
