  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 85. The response accurately describes exalting God as honoring, praising, and putting Him at the center of one's life. It emphasizes key aspects such as prayer, reading the Bible, sharing God's love, doing good deeds, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, and seeking forgiveness. The focus on loving God deeply and desiring to please Him is commendable. However, the answer could be strengthened by including more specific examples of how one can practically exalt God in daily life. Additionally, mentioning the importance of worship and obedience could enhance the completeness of the response. Overall, a solid explanation with room for further development."
