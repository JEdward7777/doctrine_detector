  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student's response contains a jumbled and repetitive retelling of the parable, with no explanation of its significance or key lessons. They have not demonstrated an understanding of the Parable of the Ten Virgins as taught by Jesus. The lack of coherence and relevance to the question shows a significant misunderstanding of the topic. To improve, the student should focus on providing a clear summary of the parable and its significance in conveying the message Jesus intended to impart."
