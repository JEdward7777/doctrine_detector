  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response is unrelated to the question asked and does not address the significance of a parable told by Jesus. The content provided does not align with the concern of recognizing moral lessons in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. It lacks clarity, coherence, and relevance to the topic, resulting in a low grade."
