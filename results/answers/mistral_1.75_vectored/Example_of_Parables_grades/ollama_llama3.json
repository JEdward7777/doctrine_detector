  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe main issue with this response is that it does not address the concern of recognizing the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. Instead, the response seems to be a repetition of a story, with no clear moral lesson or application drawn from it. The writer appears to be stuck in an infinite loop of repeating a phrase without providing any meaningful insight or connection to the original concern.\n\nTo earn a higher grade, the writer would need to take the story and extract the moral lessons that can be applied today, showing how Jesus' teachings are still relevant and important for Christians to follow."
