One of the most well-known parables taught by Jesus is the Parable of the Ten Virgins (Matthew 25:1-46). This parable teaches about the importance of being prepared for the coming of Jesus.

The story begins with a servant who was given two talents to share with his servants. He went to his servants and gave each one a talent, which was a form of currency in the time of Jesus. The servant who received two talents went to his servant who received one talent and said, "I have two talents. Let me share them with you." The servant who received one talent went to his servant who received two talents and said, "I have two talents. I want you to go and share them with my servant who has two talents."

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 20.

The main issue with this response is that it does not address the concern of recognizing the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. Instead, the response seems to be a repetition of a story, with no clear moral lesson or application drawn from it. The writer appears to be stuck in an infinite loop of repeating a phrase without providing any meaningful insight or connection to the original concern.

To earn a higher grade, the writer would need to take the story and extract the moral lessons that can be applied today, showing how Jesus' teachings are still relevant and important for Christians to follow.
