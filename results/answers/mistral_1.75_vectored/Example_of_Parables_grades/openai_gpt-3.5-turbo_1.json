  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response does not effectively address the concern of recognizing moral lessons in Jesus' parables. The content is completely unrelated to the specified concern and lacks any analysis or relevance to the Parable of the Good Samaritan. The response contains a repeated section of text which seems to be an error in the submission. Overall, the provided response does not engage with the assigned concern and therefore receives a low grade."
