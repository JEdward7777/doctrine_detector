The story begins with a servant who was given two talents to share with his servants. He went to his servants and gave each one a talent, which was a form of currency in the time of Jesus. The servant who received two talents went to his servant who received one talent and said, "I have two talents. Let me share them with you." The servant who received one talent went to his servant who received two talents and said, "I have two talents. I want you to go and share them with my servant who has two talents."

Comment: The response does not adequately address the concern provided. While the story of the Good Samaritan is indeed a powerful parable teaching the importance of love and compassion for others, it does not directly discuss the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables as a whole or their continued relevance today. A more thorough discussion connecting the parables of Jesus to their moral teachings and application in contemporary life would have been more appropriate.
