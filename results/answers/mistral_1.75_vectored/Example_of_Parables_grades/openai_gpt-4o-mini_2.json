  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided does not align with the specific concern about recognizing the moral lessons embedded in Jesus' parables and their relevance today. The content is unrelated to the Parable of the Good Samaritan and lacks depth in discussing the application of moral lessons in present-day contexts. Additionally, the repetition of a portion of the Parable of the Ten Virgins does not contribute to addressing the concern effectively. More focus on analyzing and extrapolating moral teachings from the given parable would have been beneficial."
