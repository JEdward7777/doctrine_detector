## [Answer](../Examples_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Yes, there are several instances in the Bible where Jesus Christ demonstrates His power to cast out demons. Here are some examples:

1. Matthew 8:27-32 (New Testament): Jesus went to the region of the Geralves, and 10 people who were possessed by the Holy Spirit came to Him. He cast out seven demans on seven people, and also cast out two more demans on two people who were very sick.

2. Luke 4:1-16 (New Testament): Jesus went to the region of Galilee, and was welcomed by everyone. However, Jesus wanted to fulfill His mission to love and serve all people, so He went to a nearby town to help those who were suffering. He cast out a demon that was in a woman who had been suffering for a long time.

3. Mark 5:1-17 (New Testament): Jesus went to the region of the Geralves, and went to a house to heal a woman who was suffering with a severe illness. While Jesus was praying, a demon came into the house and made the woman suffer greatly. Jesus cast out the demon and healed the woman.

4. Matthew 16:17-27 (New Testament): Jesus went to the region of the Geralves, and went to a house to heal a woman who was suffering with a severe illness. While Jesus was praying, a demon came into the house and made the woman suffer greatly. Jesus cast out the demon and healed the woman.

These are just a few examples of how Jesus demonstrated His power to cast out demons. He is always willing to help us in our times of need.
