  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response only partially addresses the concern by providing examples of Jesus casting out demons as mentioned in the Bible but lacks depth in explaining the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith. Additionally, the examples provided in the response are inaccurate and do not align with the biblical verses cited. Better integration of the biblical narrative with contemporary faith would have improved the grade."
