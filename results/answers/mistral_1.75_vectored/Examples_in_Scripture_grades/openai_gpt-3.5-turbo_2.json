  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides accurate examples of Jesus casting out demons from individuals as mentioned in the Bible verses provided in the original answer. However, there are some inaccuracies in the additional examples given by the student, such as referencing events in regions like \"Geralves\" which are not found in the biblical text. Furthermore, the additional examples lack clarity and coherence in connecting the spiritual issues to contemporary faith. Overall, while the core examples align with the biblical narrative, the inaccuracies and lack of clear linkage to contemporary faith lower the grade."
