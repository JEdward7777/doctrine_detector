  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response correctly identifies examples of Jesus casting out demons in the Bible, there are major inaccuracies in the provided verses and details given in the response. It is important to accurately cite Biblical passages and present the events correctly when discussing spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative. The response would benefit from more precise and accurate references to enhance understanding of the prevalence of spiritual issues and their relevance to contemporary faith."
