  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided multiple relevant examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt. However, there are repetitions in their list of examples, appearing multiple times (e.g., the parable of the Lambs and Sheep and the parable of the Prodigal Son). The response could have been improved by including more diverse examples instead of repeating the same ones. Additionally, the student could have provided a bit more depth or analysis about each example to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concept of guilt in the context of these stories."
