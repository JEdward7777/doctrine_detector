Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided several relevant examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt. However, their answer lacks depth and does not directly address the concern about understanding guilt in the context of justice and divine judgment. They included repetitive points and missed the opportunity to delve deeper into the theological significance of guilt in the examples they provided.
