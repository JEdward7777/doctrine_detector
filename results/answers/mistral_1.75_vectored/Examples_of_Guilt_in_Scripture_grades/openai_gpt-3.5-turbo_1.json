  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided examples that effectively demonstrate the concept of guilt in biblical stories, showing a good understanding of how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence. The integration of the provided answer about Pilate declaring Jesus innocent and the robber acknowledging guilt compared to Jesus in Luke 23:41 aligns well with the concern provided. The response could be further strengthened by demonstrating a deeper reflection on the need for divine judgment within the examples cited. Overall, a solid response with room for deeper analysis."
