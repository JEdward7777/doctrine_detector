However, while the examples given are appropriate, some repetition in referencing certain parables (e.g., the parable of the Lambs and Sheep and the Prodigal Son) could have been diversified for a more comprehensive illustration of guilt in different biblical contexts. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the implications of these examples in relation to the need for divine judgment could have enhanced the response further."
