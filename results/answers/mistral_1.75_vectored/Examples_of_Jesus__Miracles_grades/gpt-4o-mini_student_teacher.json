  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 80. The student provided specific miracles performed by Jesus and their significance, demonstrating a good understanding of Jesus' actions and their importance. However, the response could have been improved by including the teacher's reference answer examples for a more complete discussion on the significance of Jesus' miracles as signs of His divinity and the coming of God's kingdom."
