  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response addresses the concern by highlighting various miracles performed by Jesus, which serve as signs of His divinity and God's kingdom. The writer provides specific examples from the Bible that demonstrate Jesus' love, compassion, and obedience to God, as well as His desire to bring salvation and healing to all people.\n\nWhile the response does a good job of explaining the significance of Jesus' miracles, it could be improved by more directly addressing the concern about recognizing Jesus' divinity. The writer's examples are primarily focused on demonstrating Jesus' love and compassion, rather than specifically highlighting His divine nature.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides relevant biblical examples to support its claims. However, it could be further improved by more explicitly connecting the miracles to Jesus' divinity and God's kingdom."
