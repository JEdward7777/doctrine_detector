However, while the response mentions various miracles and their meanings, it could have further emphasized the significance of these miracles in strengthening belief in Jesus as the Son of God, as explicitly stated in the concern.Improveeorisms highlighting the direct connection between Jesus' miracles and His divinity would have strengthened the overall argument in alignment with a Christian worldview."
