The inclusion of the Holy Spirit's role in empowering believers is also commendable. However, the response could have emphasized more on how understanding the relationship between faith and God's promises encourages believers to trust in His word in their personal lives. Incorporating this aspect more explicitly would have further strengthened the argument from a Christian worldview."
