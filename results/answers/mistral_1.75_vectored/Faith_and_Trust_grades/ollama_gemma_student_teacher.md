Faith is also about trusting in God's love and protection. We trust in His love and protection, even when we may be going through difficult times. We trust in His promises to always be with us and to guide us through difficult times.

In addition to trusting in Jesus Christ and God, Christians also trust in the Holy Spirit, who guides and empowers us to live a life of love and obedience.
