Grade: 80

Comment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of ways that true faith in Jesus can manifest in a person's life, emphasizing love, forgiveness, prayer, worship, service to others, and living out the teachings of Jesus. The student demonstrates a good understanding of how faith translates into actions and behaviors. However, the answer could be improved by more explicitly connecting these manifestations of faith to the presence and work of the Holy Spirit, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in producing good spiritual fruits would strengthen the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective.
