  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student attempted to reference Bible verses, but the verses provided are not directly related to faithfulness in marriage and adultery. The response lacks coherence and does not effectively address the Christian perspective on maintaining integrity and faithfulness in marriage. The answer is incomplete and does not reflect a comprehensive understanding of the topic."
