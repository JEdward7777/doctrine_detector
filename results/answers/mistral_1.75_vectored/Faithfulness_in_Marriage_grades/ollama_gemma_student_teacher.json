  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately addresses the concern regarding faithfulness in marriage within a Christian worldview. It correctly cites relevant biblical passages that condemn adultery as a violation of the sacred covenant of marriage. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific implications of adultery within a Christian marriage and its broader theological significance. Additionally, the student's conclusion lacks a clear connection to the provided concern."
