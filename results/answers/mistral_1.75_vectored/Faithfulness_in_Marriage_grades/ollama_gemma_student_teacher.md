**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:**

The student's answer adequately addresses the concern regarding faithfulness in marriage within a Christian worldview. It correctly cites relevant biblical passages that condemn adultery as a violation of the sacred covenant of marriage. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific implications of adultery within a Christian marriage and its broader theological significance. Additionally, the student's conclusion lacks a clear connection to the provided concern.
