Grade: 60

Comment: The response makes a relevant connection to the concern by highlighting the importance of faithfulness in marriage according to Christian teachings. However, the excessive repetition of unrelated Bible verses detracts from the clarity and coherence of the message. The response could be improved by focusing on explaining how Christians are specifically called to uphold integrity and faithfulness within the context of marriage without excessive repetition.
