However, the use of the Bible verses in the initial response lacks coherence and clarity, which could have been improved by directly quoting relevant scriptures that emphasize the importance of integrity and faithfulness in marriage. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into practical ways Christians can uphold integrity and faithfulness in their marriages, such as through communication, transparency, and seeking accountability within the community of believers."
