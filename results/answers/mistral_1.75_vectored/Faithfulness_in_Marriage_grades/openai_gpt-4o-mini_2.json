However, the excessive repetition of verses from the Bible detracts from the clarity and coherence of the message. There could have been more depth in explaining how Christians are called to maintain integrity and faithfulness in their marriages based on the specific passage provided in the answer. Overall, a good effort with room for improvement in articulation and focus."
