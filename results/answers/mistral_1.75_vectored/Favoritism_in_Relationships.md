## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Favoritism implies showing preference or love to someone over others. It is a form of discrimination that can have negative effects on our relationships with others. When we show favoritism, we are treating people differently based on their relationship with us, which can make them feel valued or loved more than others. This can lead to hurt feelings and jealousy among those who were not shown favoritism. Additionally, favoritism can create a sense of division and tension in relationships, as those who were shown favoritism may feel like they are being treated better than others. It is important to remember that everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and respect, regardless of their relationship with us.
