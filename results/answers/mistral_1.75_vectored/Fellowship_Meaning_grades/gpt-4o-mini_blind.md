Comment: The response provides a good understanding of fellowship in a Christian context, emphasizing love, unity, sharing in the Holy Spirit, prayer, service, and sacrificial love. The mention of growing in holiness and becoming more like Jesus Christ is commendable. However, it would have been even stronger if it had included a reference to fellowship as a participation in the body of Christ and a vital component of corporate worship and discipleship within the Church.
