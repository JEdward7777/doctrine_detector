"Find grace in the eyes of God" is a phrase that has its roots in the Bible. It is a prayerful statement that is meant to be done in humility and love, as it is a request for forgiveness and guidance from God.

In the Bible, the book of Ephesians says: "For we have been made holy and washed clean by Jesus Christ our Savior. He is a gentle and loving guide, and he will always be with us. He will fill you with the Holy Spirit, who will give you strength and help you to do what is right. He will also make you holy and fill you with love. This is a gift from the Lord Jesus Christ, who loves you deeply." (Ephesians 3:12-14).

When we pray to find grace in the eyes of God, we are asking for His forgiveness and protection. We are also asking for His guidance and love to help us live a life that is pleasing to Him.

It is important to remember that finding grace in the eyes of God is not just about being forgiven, but also about living a life that is filled with love and obedience to God. It is a call to follow Jesus Christ and to live a life that is centered on His teachings and commands.
