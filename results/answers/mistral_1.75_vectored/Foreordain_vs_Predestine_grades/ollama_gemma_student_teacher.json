  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer clearly explains the relationship between \"foreordain\" and \"predestine\" in Christian teachings, drawing on relevant biblical passages. It emphasizes the central role of God's love and obedience in His plan, and correctly points out the emphasis on God's authority in \"foreordain.\" However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the difference between the two terms in the context of Christian theology."
