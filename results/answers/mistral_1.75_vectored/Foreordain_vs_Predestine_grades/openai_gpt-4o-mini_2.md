## [Answer](../Foreordain_vs_Predestine.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
"Foreordain" and "predestine" are related terms in Christian teachings. Both refer to God's plan for salvation and His love for His people.

The Bible teaches that God has a plan to save all who believe in Jesus Christ, and that He wants everyone to be saved (1 Corinthians 2:7). This is referred to as God's "great and unconditional love" (John 3:16).

In addition to this, the Bible also teaches that God has a plan to fulfill His purpose and will always come to pass (Jeremiah 29:11). This is referred to as God's "holy will."

Both "foreordain" and "predestine" are related to this holy will of God. They both refer to God's plan to fulfill His purpose and to bless His people.

For example, the Bible teaches that God foreordained that Jesus would suffer and die for the salvification of all who believe in Him (Acts 3:46). This is referred to as God's "love and obedience."

Similarly, the Bible teaches that God predestined that Jesus would come to fulfill the Old Testament prophets (Luke 2:46). This is referred to as God's "unconditional love."

In both cases, God's love and obedience are central to His plan to fulfill His purpose and bless His people.
