Additionally, there are repetitions in the response which could have been avoided for a more coherent presentation. Suggestions for improvement include providing specific examples of fulfilled prophecies in the life of Jesus, discussing how prophecies strengthen faith, and emphasizing the significance of understanding God's plan in relation to fulfilled prophecies."
