  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The student provides a good overview of the figurative uses of the word 'soul' in the Bible and how they can help understand human identity. The points mentioned regarding the soul being a reflection of God's love, a source of strength and guidance, a reminder of our eternal destiny, and our responsibility to serve others are all valid and align with Christian beliefs. However, the answer could be strengthened by incorporating more specific biblical references to support each point and deepen the analysis. Additionally, a clearer connection between the importance of the soul and human identity could enhance the overall coherence of the response."
