  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 60. \n\nWhile the student provided some relevant insights on the importance of the soul in understanding human identity from a biblical perspective, their answer did not directly address the concern raised about acknowledging the figurative language surrounding 'soul' leading to a deeper understanding of human experience. The student's points were generally sound in a Christian worldview context, but lacked depth and connection to the concern at hand. Additionally, the student could have included more specific examples or references to biblical verses to support their points.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a basic understanding of the concept but fell short in addressing the specific concern provided."
