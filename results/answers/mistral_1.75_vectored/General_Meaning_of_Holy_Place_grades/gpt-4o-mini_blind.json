However, the explanation lacks depth in terms of how Christians specifically view holy places. It would have been beneficial to include references to the Bible or Christian teachings on holy places to strengthen the argument from a Christian worldview. Additionally, emphasizing the unique significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate holy place or the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers could have enriched the response further."
