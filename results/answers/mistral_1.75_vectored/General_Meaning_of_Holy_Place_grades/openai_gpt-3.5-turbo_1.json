The expansion on the concept of holiness in places beyond just tabernacles or temples demonstrates a respectful and inclusive approach to recognizing sacred spaces. The emphasis on sanctity, reverence, and serving others in love and humility aligns well with Christian teachings on honoring God in all aspects of life."
