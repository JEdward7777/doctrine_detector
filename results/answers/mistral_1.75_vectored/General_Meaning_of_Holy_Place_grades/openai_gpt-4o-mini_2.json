It effectively addresses the concern by identifying various places in life, beyond formal religious institutions, that hold spiritual significance and provide opportunities for divine encounters. The inclusion of examples and the emphasis on sanctity, reverence, and service align well with a Christian worldview that values the sacredness of spaces dedicated to worship and connection with God. Great job in broadening the perspective and underscoring the importance of honoring God and serving others in love and humility."
