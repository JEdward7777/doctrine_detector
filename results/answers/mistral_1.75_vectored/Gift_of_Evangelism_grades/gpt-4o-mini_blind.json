It correctly highlights the role of evangelists in spreading the love of God through various means and acknowledges that all Christians are called to share the love of Jesus, but evangelists have a unique ministry in doing so. The reference to specific gifts and talents that evangelists may have is also a good point. The response could have been strengthened by including biblical references or examples to support the points made."
