## [Answer](../Gift_of_Evangelism.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
An evangelist is a Christian who is called to share the good news of Jesus Christ and spread the love of God to others. This is done through prayer, teaching, and serving others in the name of Jesus. Evangelists are also called to be witnesses to the love and forgiveness that Jesus has given to us, and to encourage others to follow Him.

In addition to this, evangelists may have specific gifts and talents that they use to share the Gospel with others. For example, some evangelists may have a gift for speaking or singing, while others may have a gift for writing or teaching.

It's important to remember that all Christians are called to share the love of Jesus with others, but evangelists are specifically called to do this as part of their ministry.
