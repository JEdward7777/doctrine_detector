It correctly emphasizes the specific calling of evangelists and their role in spreading the love of Jesus. The connection between spiritual gifts and evangelism is well-addressed, aligning with the concern provided. However, a bit more depth or elaboration on specific spiritual gifts related to evangelism could have further enhanced the response."
