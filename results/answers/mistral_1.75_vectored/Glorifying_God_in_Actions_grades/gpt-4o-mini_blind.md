Comment: The student provides a good list of ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily life. However, the answer lacks depth and specificity in explaining the theological significance and Biblical basis behind each point. Additionally, some points could be clarified further, such as distinguishing between the importance of sacrifices in the Old Testament versus the New Testament. More scriptural references and theological insights would strengthen the response.
