Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a good list of ways believers can actively glorify God in their daily life, such as prayer, reading the Bible, serving others, sharing the Gospel, living a holy life, offering sacrifices, fasting and praying, and loving and caring for family, neighbors, and all people. These actions are indeed ways to honor and glorify God's greatness. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on the importance of sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments to reflect His glory to others, which was the core concern of the question. Encouraging the student to focus more on this aspect will enhance their understanding of glorifying God in daily life.
