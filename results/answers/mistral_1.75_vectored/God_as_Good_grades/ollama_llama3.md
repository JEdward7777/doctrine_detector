Grade: 85

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical passage and its emphasis on God as the source of goodness and love. It also correctly identifies Jesus' teaching on humility and serving others, which aligns with the concern about recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs.

While the response does not explicitly state that God's moral perfection is the ultimate standard of goodness, it implies this understanding through its emphasis on God as the ultimate source of goodness and love. The only area for improvement would be to more directly connect the idea of God's moral perfection to His role as the ultimate standard of goodness.

Overall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of biblical teachings and their application to everyday life, making it deserving of an 85-grade score.
