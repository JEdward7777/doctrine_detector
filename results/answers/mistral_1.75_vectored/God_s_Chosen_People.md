## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The idea of a remnant in the Bible refers to a special group of people who were chosen by God to be saved and blessed. This remnant was not meant for everyone, but only for those who were faithful to God and obedient to His commands. This indicates that God's love and grace are not available to all people, but only to those who are willing to follow Him and live according to His teachings.

The remnant is also seen as a symbol of God's love and faithfulness to His people. Jesus said, "I am sent to fulfill the Scriptures, that I might be fulfilled in what I am commanding you to do." (Matthew 26:39). Jesus came to fulfill the Old Testament prophets and to fulfill the promises of God to His people. He came to save His remnant and to bless them with eternal life.

In the New Testament, the remnant is referred to as the Church. The Church is called to be a remnant of Christ, to be a holy and holy body of believers who are called to be a light to the world. The Church is called to be a witness to the love and grace of Jesus Christ, to share His love with others, and to be a blessing to the world.

In this way, the remnant is a reminder of God's selective grace towards His people. It reminds us that God loves us and wants to bless us, but that we must be willing to follow Him and obey His commands. It also reminds us that we are called to be a light to the world, to share the love and grace of Jesus Christ with others, and to be a blessing to the world.
