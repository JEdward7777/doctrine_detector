However, there are inaccuracies and misinterpretations present. For example, the statement that God's love and grace are not available to all people goes against Christian doctrine, as God's offer of salvation is extended to all humanity. Additionally, the reference to Matthew 26:39 seems out of context in relation to the concept of a remnant. The answer lacks depth and clarity in connecting the idea of a remnant with God's selective grace in a more doctrinally sound manner."
