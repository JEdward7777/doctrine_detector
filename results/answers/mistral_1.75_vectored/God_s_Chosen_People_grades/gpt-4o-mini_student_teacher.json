  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the concept of the remnant in the Bible and how it signifies God's selective grace towards His people. The response effectively connects the idea of the remnant to God's love and faithfulness. However, the student's answer could have been more concise and focused directly on the core concept without adding extraneous details."
