  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response effectively expands on the idea of the remnant in the Bible, highlighting the significance of being chosen by God and emphasizing the role of faith and obedience in receiving His grace. It is rooted in a Christian worldview, discussing the remnant in relation to Jesus Christ and the Church. The connection made between God's selective grace and the call for believers to be lights in the world adds depth to the discussion. The response could further benefit from more explicit references to biblical verses or theological teachings to strengthen the Christian perspective."
