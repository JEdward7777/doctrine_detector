  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided some relevant Bible verses that highlight God's love and compassion. However, the response lacks depth and coherence in explaining God's nature in relation to compassion. The student should focus on expanding their explanation using biblical principles and theological understanding to enhance the response. Additionally, the use of repetitive verses without further contextual analysis weakens the overall argument."
