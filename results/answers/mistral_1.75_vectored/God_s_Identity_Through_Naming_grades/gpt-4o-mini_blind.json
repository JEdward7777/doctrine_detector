  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful examination of the concept of being called by God's name and its implications for our relationship with Him. The student effectively connects this divine calling to discipleship, obedience, transformation, and evangelism. The emphasis on being a reflection of Christ and living out the teachings of the Bible is commendable. However, the response could benefit from more direct references to specific biblical passages that address being called by God's name to strengthen the doctrinal foundation. Overall, a solid reflection with room for deeper theological exploration."
