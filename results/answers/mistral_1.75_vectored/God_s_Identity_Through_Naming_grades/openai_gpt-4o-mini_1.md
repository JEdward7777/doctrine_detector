## [Answer](../God_s_Identity_Through_Naming.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The phrase "being called by my name" is a powerful and symbolic way to express our relationship with God. It reflects the deepest desire to be known and loved by God, and to be part of His Holy mission.

In the Bible, Jesus teaches us that we are called to be followers of Christ, and to serve Him in love and obedience. This calling is not just a command, but a gift and a blessing. It is a call to be transformed into the image of Christ, to be filled with the Holy Spirit, and to be sent out to share the good news of salvation to all people.

When we are called by His name, we are also called to be holy and righteous, to live according to the teachings of the Bible, and to be a light and a witness to others. We are called to be a reflection of Jesus Christ, who came to save us from sin and to give us eternal life.

Being called by His name is a sacred privilege and a great responsibility. It is a call to follow Jesus Christ, to love and serve Him, and to be a servant of others. It is a call to be a member of the Church, to pray and worship God, and to be a witness to the love and grace of Jesus Christ.

In this way, being called by His name reflects our relationship with God as a loving and faithful servant, who wants to be close to us and to bless us in every way. It is a call to be a servant of love and peace, to be a witness to the love of Jesus Christ, and to be a light and a hope for all people.
