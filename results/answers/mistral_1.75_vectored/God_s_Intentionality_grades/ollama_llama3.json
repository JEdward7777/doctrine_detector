  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights the intentional nature of God's call, emphasizing that it is not a random or arbitrary invitation, but rather a deliberate and purposeful one. The mention of \"specific plan and purpose\" and \"specific command from God\" further underscores this point. The only area for improvement is that the response could have delved deeper into the implications of this intentional nature, such as how it relates to human responsibility and the importance of recognizing and responding to God's call. Overall, however, the response does an excellent job of addressing the concern and providing biblical support for its claims."
