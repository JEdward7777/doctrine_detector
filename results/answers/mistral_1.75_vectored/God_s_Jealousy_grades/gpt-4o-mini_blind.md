Comment: The answer correctly identifies the aspect of God's love and protection for His people in describing Him as "jealous." However, it could be strengthened by including the aspect of God's righteous anger against sin and idolatry, which is also conveyed in the concept of His jealousy in the Bible. Additionally, tying in the importance of repentance and turning away from sin in response to God's jealousy would enhance the doctrinal completeness of the explanation.
