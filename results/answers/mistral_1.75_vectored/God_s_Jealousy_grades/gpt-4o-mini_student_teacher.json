  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of God's jealousy as a reflection of His love and desire for His people's holiness. However, the student could further strengthen their answer by emphasizing God's specific desire for fidelity and reverence from His covenant people, as highlighted in scripture. Overall, a good explanation with room for slight improvement in aligning with the Christian worldview perspective."
