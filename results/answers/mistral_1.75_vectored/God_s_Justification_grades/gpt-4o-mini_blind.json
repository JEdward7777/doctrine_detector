However, it could benefit from more specific references to biblical passages that support these teachings and strengthen the doctrinal correctness. Additionally, emphasizing the role of faith in Jesus Christ as the means of justification could have been more explicitly stated. Overall, a good understanding of the concept is demonstrated."
