  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of justification, linking it to forgiveness, righteousness, sanctification, and renewal in the Holy Spirit. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the core aspect of justification, which is God declaring sinners righteous through faith in Jesus. The student's response captured key elements of the Christian doctrine of justification but could be more concise and centered on the specific process of how God justifies sinners."
