## [Answer](../God_s_Justification.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Justification is a Christian doctrine that teaches that God loves and wants to be with all people, including those who have sinned. Jesus Christ came to earth to teach us how to live and to forgive our sins. He died on the cross to pay the penalty for our sins, so that we could be forgiven and made right with God.

Justification is not just about being forgiven, but also about being made right with God. This means that we are not only forgiven of our sins, but also made holy and righteous in God's eyes. This is done through faith in Jesus Christ, who has already paid the price for our sins.

In addition to this, justification also involves being sanctified and renewed in the Holy Spirit. This means that we are not just forgiven, but also transformed into new people in Christ. We are called to live a life of love and obedience to God, and to share this love with others.

In summary, justification is a Christian doctrine that teaches that God loves and wants to be with all people, including those who have sinned. It involves being forgiven and made right with God, as well as being sanctified and renewed in the Holy Spirit.
