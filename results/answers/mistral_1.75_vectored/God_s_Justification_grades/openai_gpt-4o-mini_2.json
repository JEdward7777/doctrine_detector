  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively clarifies the Christian doctrine of justification by emphasizing that God justifies sinners through forgiveness and declaring them righteous when they repent and trust in Jesus for salvation. It also highlights the importance of justification in salvation. The additional explanation in the graded response expands on the initial answer with a thorough explanation of how justification involves not only forgiveness but also being made right with God and transformed through sanctification in the Holy Spirit. The response aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern provided."
