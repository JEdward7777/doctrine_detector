  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the significance of the name \"Yahweh\" in the Bible, touching on its meanings, its relation to Jesus, and its use in prayer. While the student's answer demonstrated an understanding of the spiritual significance of the name, it did not specifically mention the eternal existence and unchanging nature of God emphasized by the name \"Yahweh.\" Integrating this aspect would have further deepened the answer in relation to the given concern about deepening reverence and understanding in worship."
