It shows a good understanding of how God's promises are fulfilled in biblical narratives. However, the response could have benefitted from directly addressing the concern about understanding God's promises helping believers trust His faithfulness in their own lives. Overall, a strong explanation with room for a more explicit connection to the concern provided."
