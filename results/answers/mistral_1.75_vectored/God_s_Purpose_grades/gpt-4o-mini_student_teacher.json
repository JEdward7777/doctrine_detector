  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student's response aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of prayer, scripture, the guidance of the Holy Spirit, love, obedience, and serving others in discerning God's plan. These are all key principles in Christian faith when seeking to understand God's will for one's life. The student's answer is comprehensive and provides practical steps for discernment.\n\nThe only minor deduction could be that the answer could have included seeking counsel from mature Christians as mentioned in the reference answer to further emphasize the importance of seeking guidance and wisdom from others in the Christian community. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of how believers can discern God's plan for their lives."
