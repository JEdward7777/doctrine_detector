However, it misses the important point that Jesus is one person of the Trinity, which includes God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit. The student should have specifically mentioned how God introduces Himself using names like \"I AM\" or \"Yahweh\" in the Bible to provide a more comprehensive answer."
