70.0

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
## Grade: 70

**Comment:** While the student's answer correctly identifies some of Jesus' self-introductions in the Bible, it lacks depth and fails to address the concern regarding God's revelation of Himself through his name "Yahweh." The response would benefit from referencing specific scriptures or examples from the Bible that demonstrate the significance of God's name in revealing his character and relationship with his followers.
