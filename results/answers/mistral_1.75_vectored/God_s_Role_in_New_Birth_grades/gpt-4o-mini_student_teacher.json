  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer focuses more on the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of a Christian rather than specifically addressing God's role in the process of a person being born again. The answer lacks a clear emphasis on God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation, which is a key concern in a Christian worldview. The student should further emphasize the divine initiative and work of God in the process of salvation."
