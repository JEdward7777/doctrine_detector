It accurately identifies Jesus Christ as the Savior and the Holy Spirit as a guide and protector. The student also provides a clear explanation of how faith in Jesus Christ and reliance on the Holy Spirit are essential for salvation. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of divine initiative in the process of new birth."
