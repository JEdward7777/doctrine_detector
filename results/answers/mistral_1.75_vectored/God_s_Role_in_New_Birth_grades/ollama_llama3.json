The answer provided emphasizes human effort and human actions (e.g., prayer, reading the Bible) as necessary for becoming a Christian, whereas the concern highlights the need to recognize that salvation is ultimately God's work.\n\nThe response could be improved by incorporating language that acknowledges God's sovereignty and initiative in the process of salvation. For example, it could have mentioned how the Holy Spirit convicts people of sin and draws them to Christ, or how faith in Jesus Christ is a gift from God. By incorporating these ideas, the response would better align with the concern and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the role of the Holy Spirit in salvation."
