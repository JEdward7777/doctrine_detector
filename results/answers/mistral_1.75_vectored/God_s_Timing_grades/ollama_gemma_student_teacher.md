Understanding the concept of "appointed time" can enhance our faith in God's plans by reminding us that everything happens according to His timing. This includes the times when we are blessed and the times when we are tested. By trusting in His timing, we can have peace and comfort during difficult times, knowing that He is working everything out for good.
