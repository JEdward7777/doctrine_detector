It adequately explores the relationship between God's timing and our expectations in life by emphasizing the importance of patience, peace, and focusing on Jesus even when things don't happen as quickly as we desire. The integration of Christian worldview elements is strong, but could be further deepened by providing more specific scriptural references or examples to support the response."
