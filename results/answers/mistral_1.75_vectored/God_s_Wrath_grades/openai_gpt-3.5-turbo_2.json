The connection to the consequences of disbelief is addressed through the reference to God's wrath upon those who do not believe. However, the response could have delved deeper into the specific biblical teachings on this topic and offered more scriptural references to support the points made. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the importance of faith and belief in Jesus Christ for redemption could have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
