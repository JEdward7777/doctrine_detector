However, it falls short in addressing the specific concern about the nature of God's judgment as a pouring out of His wrath upon those who do not believe. It is important to emphasize the seriousness of God's judgment for disbelief and the eternal consequences that come with it. The response could have included more direct references to relevant Bible verses that highlight this aspect of God's judgment."
