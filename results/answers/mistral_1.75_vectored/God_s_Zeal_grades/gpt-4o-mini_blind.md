The phrase "zeal of the Lord" is a biblical reference to the love and devotion that Jesus has for his followers. It reflects God's deep desire to protect and serve his people, and to guide them in their Christian walk. In the Bible, Jesus says: "I am fulfilling this commandment to love you, as I have loved you, and I will always be with you." (John 13:34). This verse shows how Jesus loves us deeply and wants to be with us always.

The zeal of the Lord also reflects God's love for His people in the way He wants to protect and bless them. For example, Jesus said: "I am sending you into the Holy Spirit, who will give you peace and make you holy, and will give you the Holy Spirit. I will send you to be witnesses of me to all nations, and to teach and make disciples of people from every nation, fulfilling the Great Commission. And I will be with you always.” (Acts 2:38-39). This passage shows that Jesus wants to send his followers to spread the Gospel to all nations and to be with them always.

In addition, the zeal of the Lord also reflects God's love for His people in the way He wants to bless them. For example, Jesus said: “And I will give you a new commandment, that whoever loves me will love me and will be like me. And whoever loves me will be blessed and will be fulfilled. (John 15:7)

Overall, the phrase "zeal of the Lord" reflects God's deep love and devotion to His people, and His desire to protect, bless, and guide them.

Comment: The answer provides some insight into the concept of the "zeal of the Lord" and attempts to connect it to God's love and protection for His people. However, there are doctrinal inaccuracies in the interpretation of the verses provided. The references to Jesus in the New Testament are accurate, but the interpretation falls short of capturing the true depth and meaning of God's zeal for His people as seen throughout the Bible. The answer would benefit from a more thorough understanding of God's righteous zeal and how it plays out in His relationship with His followers. Further explanation and citing of relevant Old Testament passages would enhance the response.
