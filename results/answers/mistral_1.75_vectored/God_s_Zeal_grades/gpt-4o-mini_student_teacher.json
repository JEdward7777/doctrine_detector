  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some relevant points about God's love and desire to protect, bless, and guide His people, which aligns with the concern about deepening believers' trust in God's commitment. However, the student's response focuses more on Jesus' actions rather than the zeal of the Lord specifically. The reference answer emphasizes God's efforts to bless His people and ensure justice, which the student's answer does not fully capture. There is a need for more precise theological focus on the concept of God's zeal as portrayed in the Bible."
