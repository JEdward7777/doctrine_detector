The references to biblical verses support the explanation well. However, the response could have delved deeper into the aspect of justice and the fulfillment of God's will in ensuring justice for His people, as mentioned in the given answer. Connecting the idea of justice to the expression of God's zeal would have further emphasized His commitment to believers' well-being. Overall, a solid response but could have been strengthened with additional analysis on the justice aspect."
