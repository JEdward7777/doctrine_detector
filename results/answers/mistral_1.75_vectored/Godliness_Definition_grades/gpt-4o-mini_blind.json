  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid understanding of the concept of godliness as defined in the Bible. The student effectively captures key aspects such as loving God, obeying His commands, forgiving others, showing love and kindness, humility, meekness, and service to others. The mention of godliness as a gift from God adds depth to the explanation. However, to improve, the student could have included specific Bible verses or references supporting each aspect of godliness mentioned in the response. Adding scriptural support would strengthen the overall answer."
