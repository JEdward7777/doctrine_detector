  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: The student's response contains some elements of truth regarding Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals with love and compassion, as well as casting out demons in His name. However, the interpretation of the Bible verse provided (Matthew 7:17) is incorrect and not directly related to the topic of healing demon-possessed individuals. Additionally, the response lacks depth and clarity in explaining Jesus' method of dealing with demon possession. More accurate Biblical references and a deeper understanding of Jesus' authority and actions in these situations would improve the grade."
