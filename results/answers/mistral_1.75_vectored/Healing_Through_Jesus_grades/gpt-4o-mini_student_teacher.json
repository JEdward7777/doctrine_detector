  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60 \n\nComment: The student demonstrated some understanding of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals by mentioning the act of casting out demons. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the importance of prayer and faith in the healing process. The student's reference to Matthew 7:17 is not directly related to healing demon-possessed individuals. Additional biblical references and a clearer focus on Jesus' authority and power would have strengthened the response."
