## [Answer](../Healing_Through_Jesus.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
According to the Bible, Jesus approached the healing of demon-possled individuals with love and compassion. He would first speak in the name of Jesus to cast out the demons that were in the person. He also taught His followers to do the same. In Matthew 7:17, Jesus said "I am fulfilling this commandment to you, that whoever loves me will be blessed and I will come to help you. (Matthew 7:17).

Grade: 60 

Comment: The student demonstrated some understanding of Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals by mentioning the act of casting out demons. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the importance of prayer and faith in the healing process. The student's reference to Matthew 7:17 is not directly related to healing demon-possessed individuals. Additional biblical references and a clearer focus on Jesus' authority and power would have strengthened the response.
