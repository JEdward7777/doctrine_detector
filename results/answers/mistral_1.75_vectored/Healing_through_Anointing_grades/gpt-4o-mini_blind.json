However, there are some inaccuracies in the Bible verses cited, such as the misquoting of Luke 27:26-27 and Matthew 26:46. Additionally, the explanation could benefit from a more in-depth theological analysis of the significance of anointing in healing, connecting it to the broader themes of God's power and Christ's authority. A more precise use of biblical references would enhance the overall coherence and accuracy of the answer."
