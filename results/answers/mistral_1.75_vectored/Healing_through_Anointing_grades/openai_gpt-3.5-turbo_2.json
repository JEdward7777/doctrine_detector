The student effectively incorporates biblical references and examples to support their points, emphasizing the connection between anointing, healing, and the power of Jesus Christ. However, there could have been a more explicit connection made to the Christian worldview in terms of the significance of anointing in spiritual and physical healing as a core part of Christian practice. Overall, a strong response demonstrating knowledge of the topic from a Christian perspective."
