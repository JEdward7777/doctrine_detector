## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The practice of anointing in the New Testament is closely associated with healing. In the Bible, anointing is mentioned several times as a way to bring healing and blessings.

In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus says: "And whoever wants to be blessed and be fulfilled will be blessed and will be fulfilled. He will be blessed who loves me and who is called to be loved. And whoever loves me will be blessed and will be fulfilled. (Luke 27:26-27).

Jesus also said: "And whoever has a servant who loves him will be blessed and will be fulfilled. (Matthew 26:46).

In the book of Acts, we see the apostles using anointing for healing. For example, Acts 3:1-5 tells us about Peter and James being sent to heal a person who was lame. They went to him, prayed for him, and anointed him with oil. The Bible says that he was filled with the Holy Spirit and was healed.

Another example is found in Acts 9:1-14, where Jesus sends Saul to be baptized and receive the Holy Spirit. He was then anointed with oil and received the gift of the Holy Spirit.

In the Bible, anointing is seen as a way to bring healing and blessings. It is a symbol of God's love and blessing, and it is a reminder of the power of Jesus Christ to heal and bless those who are anointed.
