## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The ark of the covenant was a sacred Christian symbol that contained the Bible's Old Testament. It was considered a holy object and was only allowed to be approached by those who were pure in heart and had been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

The book of Revelation in the New Testament tells us that the Lamb (Jesus) will come to fulfill the promise of the Lamb in the Gospel of Matthew, which is to fulfill the commandment to love one another. This promise is fulfilled through the Holy Spirit, who comes upon all believers who are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

In addition to being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, those who were allowed to approach the ark of the covenant were also required to have a heart filled with love and obedience to God. They were also required to wear holy garments and to follow specific instructions for how to approach the ark.

It is important to note that the ark of the covenant was not just a physical object, but also a spiritual symbol of the love and obedience of Christians. Those who were allowed to approach it were considered to be part of the Church of Jesus Christ and were called to live out their faith in love and obedience to God.
