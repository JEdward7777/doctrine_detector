However, there are significant theological inaccuracies in the response, such as equating the ark with a Christian symbol containing the Old Testament and the interpretation of the role of the ark and the high priest in Christian terms. The response also does not fully address the concern regarding the high priest's role in Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant."
