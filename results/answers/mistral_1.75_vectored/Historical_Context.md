The Bible teaches us that God has a special love for His people, and He wants to bless them with His love and salvation. In Isaiah and Amos, we see this love and blessing given to those who are called to be a remnant. Here are some examples:

1. Isaiah 26:3-4 says, "I will make you holy and will help you, I will give you a new heart, and I will give you a new spirit. I will endure you and will always love you." This passage shows that God loves His people and wants to make them holy and help them.

2. Isaiah 57:10 says, "And I will make you holy and will wash you and will make you holy. I will also make you holy in the Holy Spirit. I will answer you and will bless you and will make you holy.
