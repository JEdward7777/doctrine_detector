  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer inaccurately attributes the commandment regarding unleavened bread to Jesus Christ, when in fact it was God who gave this instruction to the Israelites. The response also conflates the significance of the Feast of the Lamb with the historical context of the Israelites' escape from Egypt. To improve the grade, the student needs to correctly identify God as the giver of the commandment and provide a more accurate explanation of the historical events surrounding the Israelites' consumption of unleavened bread."
