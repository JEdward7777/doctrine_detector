The primary concern is recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices. However, this response does not accurately convey the significance of unleavened bread in the Exodus narrative. It also incorrectly attributes Jesus Christ's commandment to the Israelites' eating of unleavened bread. Furthermore, it mislabels Holy Week as a time for preparation for Easter, when in fact, it is a period that commemorates Jesus' death and resurrection."
