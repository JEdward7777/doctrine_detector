The Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt to fulfill a commandment given by Jesus Christ. This is part of the Holy Week, which is a week of preparation for Easter. It is also known as the Feast of the Lamb and is a time of spiritual renewal and preparation for the coming of Jesus Christ.
