  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response does not address the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises, as required by the concern. The answer is overly repetitive and lacks specific biblical events illustrating the concept of 'remnant' as seen in Isaiah and Amos. The student should focus on providing concise and relevant information that aligns with the question and concern provided."
