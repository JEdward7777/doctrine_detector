  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: While the response does make referencing to biblical passages that speak of God's love and blessings towards His people, there is a lack of addressing the historical significance of the remnant in context of God's promises. The answer provided does not directly relate to the concern given, which lowers the grade. The response needs to show a deeper understanding of how the remnant theme in Isaiah and Amos ties in with God's covenant promises throughout history."
