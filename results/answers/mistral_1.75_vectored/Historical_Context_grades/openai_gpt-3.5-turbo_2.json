  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided does not adequately address the concern regarding the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises. While the passages from Isaiah are related to God's love and blessing for His people, there is a lack of depth in connecting them to the historical context of the remnant's role in God's promises. The excessive repetition in the second passage also detracts from the coherence and relevance of the response. Further explanation and coherence with the specific concern would be needed for a higher grade."
