While the Bible verses shared emphasize God's love and blessings for His people, they do not specifically tie into the concept of a remnant in the historical context of exile and judgment as outlined in the provided answer. Further integration of the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises is needed for a more comprehensive and accurate response."
