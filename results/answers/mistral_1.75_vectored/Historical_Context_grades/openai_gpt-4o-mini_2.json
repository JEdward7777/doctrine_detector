  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the response attempts to discuss the concept of a remnant in relation to God's promises by citing Bible verses from Isaiah, it does not directly address the concern of understanding the historical significance of a remnant in God's promises. The excessive repetition in the Bible verses provided also detracts from the coherence and focus of the response. A stronger connection between the given answer and historical context would have improved the overall grade."
