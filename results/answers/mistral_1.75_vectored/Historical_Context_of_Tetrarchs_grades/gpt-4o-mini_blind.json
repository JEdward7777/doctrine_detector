However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies. The mention of tetrarch Herodianus and his persecution of Christians is historically inaccurate, as Herodianus is not a known historical figure related to this period. Additionally, the statement about the tetrarchs seeing themselves as fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament and leading to persecution of Jews who did not follow Jesus Christ is not entirely accurate either, as the tetrarchs were not necessarily focused on the Messiah in the way described. The answer could be improved by providing more precise and historically accurate information in line with Christian teachings and doctrines."
