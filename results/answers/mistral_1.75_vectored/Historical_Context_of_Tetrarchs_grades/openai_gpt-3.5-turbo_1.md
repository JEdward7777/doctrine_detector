## [Answer](../Historical_Context_of_Tetrarchs.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies had several impacts on the Jewish people. Here are some of them:

1. Increased persecution: The tetrarchs were not all good leaders, and some of them were known for their persecution of the Jews. For example, Herodianus, who was one of the tetrarchs, was known for his persecution of the Christians and Jews.

2. Division of the Holy Land: The tetrarchs divided the Holy Land among themselves, which led to the division of the Christian Church as well. This also meant that the Jewish people were divided into different regions, which could have led to greater conflict and division.

3. Increased Roman influence: The tetrarchs were also known for their close relationship with the Romans, which increased the Roman influence in the region. This could have led to greater persecution of the Jews, as the Romans were known for their persecution of Christians and Jews.

4. Increased focus on the Messiah: The tetrarchs also brought a greater focus on the Messiah, as they saw themselves as fulfilling the prophecies of the Old Testament. This could have led to greater persecution of the Jews who were not following the teachings of Jesus Christ.

Overall, the division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies had significant impacts on the Jewish people, including increased persecution, division of the Holy Land, increased Roman influence, and a greater focus on the Messiah.
