Comment: The response touches on some important aspects of how the Roman practice of crucifixion influenced the perception of the cross in early Christianity. However, there are some spelling errors ("crucifusion" instead of "crucifixion") and the explanation could be more detailed and specific. Additionally, the connection between the cross as a symbol of victory and salvation could be further expanded upon with biblical references such as Colossians 2:14-15. A more thorough exploration of the theological significance of the cross would enhance the answer.
