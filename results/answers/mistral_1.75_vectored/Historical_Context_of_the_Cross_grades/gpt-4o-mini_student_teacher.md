Comment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the impact of the Roman practice of crucifixion on the perception of the cross in early Christianity. They correctly mention the symbolism of love, sacrifice, and victory associated with the cross, as well as its role in reminding believers of Jesus' sacrifice. However, the student could improve their answer by emphasizing the transformation of the cross from a symbol of shame and suffering to one of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a solid response but could benefit from more focus on the transformation aspect.
