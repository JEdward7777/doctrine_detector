Grade: 90

Comment: The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the transformation of the cross from a symbol of shame and suffering to one of hope, victory, and eternal life through Jesus' resurrection. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian worldview and the central message of Christianity. The only minor point of improvement would be to include more explicit references to biblical passages or theological concepts to further support the argument.
