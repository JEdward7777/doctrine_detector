However, there are significant inaccuracies in the response. Firstly, the claim that Isaac built a sacrificial altar in Genesis 14:17 is incorrect; it was actually Abraham who built the altar. Furthermore, the answer's references to Jesus as building sacrificial altars are not biblically accurate. Jesus Himself did not physically build altars during His earthly ministry. The response also lacks depth and explanation regarding the true significance and symbolism of altars in the Bible. The student would benefit from a clearer understanding and more precise application of biblical examples in their response."
