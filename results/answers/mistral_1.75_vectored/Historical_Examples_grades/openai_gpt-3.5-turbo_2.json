However, the examples given in the response regarding Jesus and the Lamb of Jesus may not directly relate to the concern of inspiring Christians through intentional acts of worship. While the response is informative, it could have been strengthened by focusing more on how these historical examples can serve as inspiration for Christians to express their faith and devotion through worship."
