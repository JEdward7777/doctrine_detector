  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: This response provides a good overview of how to introduce the concept of the Holy Spirit in contexts unfamiliar with the Trinity. The student emphasizes the importance of presenting the Holy Spirit as a gift from God and explaining its role in guiding and empowering Christians. Using scripture and offering a prayer are valuable suggestions. However, the response could benefit from a clearer distinction between the Holy Spirit as a distinct person within the Trinity, rather than solely focusing on its role and actions. Additionally, further elaboration on how the Holy Spirit relates to God the Father and God the Son would enhance the explanation."
