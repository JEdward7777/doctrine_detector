  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer clearly explains the importance of introducing the Holy Spirit in a respectful and meaningful way to those unfamiliar with the Trinity. They provide practical suggestions for doing so, including emphasizing the Holy Spirit as a gift from God, explaining his role in living a Christian life, using scripture, and offering a prayer. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly acknowledging that the Holy Spirit is part of the Trinity and explaining his role in the believer's life in more detail."
