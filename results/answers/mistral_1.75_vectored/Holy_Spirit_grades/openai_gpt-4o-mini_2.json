The suggestions given align well with the initial answer in terms of introducing the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity and explaining His role in the believer's life. The use of scripture and prayer is commendable. However, the response could have emphasized more on the importance of sound teaching to prevent misconceptions about the Holy Spirit's identity and work, as mentioned in the concern."
