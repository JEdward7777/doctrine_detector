## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, having hope is considered a precious gift that should be cherished and protected. The Bible teaches us to have hope in Jesus Christ, who is our Savior and Lord. He is the source of our hope and salvation, and we are called to live out our lives in hope and love.

In the New Testament, Jesus tells us to have hope in Him, saying "I am the Holy Spirit, sent to strengthen you and make you holy, and I will give you peace and joy in the Holy Spirit." (Acts 2:31-32). He also says, "I am the light of the world. Whoever loves me will be with me forever. I will come to you to fulfill this commandment: Love one another. Everyone who loves has been given a commandment to love, that we may love one another. And whoever loves has fulfilled this commandment. That is what makes us Christians.‚Äù (John 7:14-15).

Having hope in Jesus Christ is not just about having a hopeful attitude or a positive mindset. It is about having a deep and abiding relationship with Jesus Christ, who is our Savior and Lord. We are called to live out our lives in hope and love, and to share that hope with others so that they too can receive the love and salvification that Jesus offers.
