They provide relevant biblical references to support their claims, highlighting the importance of hope in Jesus Christ. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian belief in salvation through Christ and emphasizes the need for a personal relationship with him. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of \"having no hope\" from a biblical perspective. Exploring the idea of hopelessness in other contexts, such as Job or the Psalms, could strengthen the overall argument. Additionally, including some practical applications of hope in Christian life would enhance the response."
