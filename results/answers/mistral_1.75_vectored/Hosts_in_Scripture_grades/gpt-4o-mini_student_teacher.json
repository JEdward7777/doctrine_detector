  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60.\n\nWhile the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the term \"hosts\" in a Christian context, their answer falls short in accurately portraying the full scope of what the term actually encompasses according to scripture. The student's response focuses primarily on the community of believers and heavenly hosts, neglecting key aspects such as armies of angels, the spirit world, and celestial bodies like stars and planets. To fully grasp the significance of the term \"hosts\" in scripture and its relevance to spiritual warfare and divine authority, it is essential to include all elements mentioned in the reference answer.\n\nTherefore, the student's response, while showing some understanding, lacks depth and comprehensive insight."
