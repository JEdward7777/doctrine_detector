  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer is accurate and comprehensive in explaining the various contexts in which the term \"hosts\" is used in scripture. They correctly identify the primary reference to followers of Jesus Christ, both on earth and in heaven. Additionally, the explanation of the heavenly hosts and their significance is well-articulated. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the idea of the multitude in scripture, specifically referencing other potential interpretations of \"hosts\" beyond the contexts mentioned. The connection to angels, spirits, and celestial bodies could be elaborated on to address the concern regarding spiritual warfare and divine authority."
