However, the discussion lacks depth in connecting this understanding to the broader implications of spiritual warfare and divine authority on a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. A stronger integration of how the concept of \"hosts\" relates to spiritual warfare and prayer would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
