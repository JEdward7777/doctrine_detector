  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the term \"hosts\" referring to a wide range of individuals in the Christian community, including angels, spiritual beings, and believers. However, the response does not directly address the concern regarding the impact of understanding the scope of spiritual warfare and divine authority on a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. To improve the grade, the response could have connected the concept of hosts to the importance of recognizing the spiritual warfare and authority in prayer for believers."
