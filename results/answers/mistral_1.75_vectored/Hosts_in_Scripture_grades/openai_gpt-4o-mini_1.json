  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the term \"hosts\" in scripture, drawing on both earthly and heavenly hosts. However, the answer does not directly address the concern raised about the impact of understanding spiritual warfare and divine authority on prayer and spiritual battles. To improve the grade, the response could have connected the understanding of hosts to the believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles from a Christian worldview."
