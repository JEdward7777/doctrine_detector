  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer a 75.\n\nWhile the response provides some good suggestions on how to respond to feelings of jealousy in relationships, it lacks a strong emphasis on the Christian worldview when addressing this issue. The mention of praying for the jealous person and seeking guidance from the Bible are positive aspects of the response. However, it could have delved deeper into the theological aspects of jealousy and how scripture addresses it. Additionally, more emphasis on seeking God's wisdom and relying on His grace to navigate through jealousy in relationships would have strengthened the answer.\n\nOverall, the response provides good practical advice with a Christian perspective, but it could have been more robust in integrating Christian doctrine related to jealousy."
