  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60/100.\n\nThe student provided some helpful suggestions for responding to feelings of jealousy in relationships, such as practicing active listening, expressing love and support, seeking forgiveness, praying, and seeking guidance from the Bible. These are positive steps to take in addressing jealousy within relationships from a Christian perspective. However, the student's answer could have been improved by emphasizing the importance of open communication and trust, as well as evaluating the root causes of jealousy and working towards resolving them in a healthy manner. Additionally, the student's response could have included more specific references to Biblical teachings on jealousy and relationships to strengthen their answer."
