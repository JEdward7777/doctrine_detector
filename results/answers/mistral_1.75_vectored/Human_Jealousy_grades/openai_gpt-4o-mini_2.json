  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides practical and thoughtful advice on responding to feelings of jealousy in relationships from a Christian perspective. It emphasizes the importance of active listening, expressing love and support, seeking forgiveness, prayer, seeking guidance from the Bible, and treating others with kindness and respect. The integration of Christian principles such as seeking forgiveness, praying for others, and using biblical teachings to guide responses is commendable. However, there was a missed opportunity to directly address the impact of jealousy on personal relationships as raised in the concern. Therefore, while the response is well-rounded and offers valuable insights, a higher grade could have been achieved by directly addressing the specified concern."
