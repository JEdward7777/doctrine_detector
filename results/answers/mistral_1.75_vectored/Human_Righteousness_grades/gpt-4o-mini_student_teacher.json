  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of how a person is declared righteous in the Christian faith through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and acceptance of Him as Lord and Savior. The student emphasized the importance of Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection for salvation. However, the student could have further emphasized the aspect of imputed righteousness, where the righteousness of Jesus is credited to believers through faith, as highlighted in the reference answer."
