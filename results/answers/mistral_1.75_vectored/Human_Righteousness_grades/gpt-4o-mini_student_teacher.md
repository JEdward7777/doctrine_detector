## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Christian faith, a person is declared righteous through Jesus Christ. This is done by accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior, and by following His teachings and commands. The Bible teaches that Jesus came to save us from our sins and to make us holy and righteous. He died for our sins and was resurrected to give us eternal life. To be declared righteous, we must have faith in Jesus and receive Him into our hearts. We also need to repent of our sins and ask for forgiveness. Through this act of salvation, we are made righteous and become a new creation in Christ.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a solid explanation of how a person is declared righteous in the Christian faith through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and acceptance of Him as Lord and Savior. The student emphasized the importance of Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection for salvation. However, the student could have further emphasized the aspect of imputed righteousness, where the righteousness of Jesus is credited to believers through faith, as highlighted in the reference answer.
