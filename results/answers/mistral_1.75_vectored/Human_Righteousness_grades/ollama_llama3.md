## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Christian faith, a person is declared righteous through Jesus Christ. This is done by accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior, and by following His teachings and commands. The Bible teaches that Jesus came to save us from our sins and to make us holy and righteous. He died for our sins and was resurrected to give us eternal life. To be declared righteous, we must have faith in Jesus and receive Him into our hearts. We also need to repent of our sins and ask for forgiveness. Through this act of salvation, we are made righteous and become a new creation in Christ.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response an 85.

The response accurately captures the core message of Christian salvation, emphasizing the importance of trusting in Jesus to save us from our sins. The phrase "God cleanses them from their sins" effectively conveys the idea that our righteous standing before God is a result of His actions, rather than our own efforts. Additionally, the mention of attributing Jesus' righteousness to us highlights the notion that our new life in Christ is based on His divine character, rather than our own.

However, I would deduct a few points because the response could be more explicit in explaining how this works in relation to faith in Jesus. The concern specified states that clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential, and while the response does touch on this topic, it could delve deeper into the nature of faith and its role in our salvation.

Overall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding salvation, but could benefit from further elaboration on the relationship between faith and righteousness.
