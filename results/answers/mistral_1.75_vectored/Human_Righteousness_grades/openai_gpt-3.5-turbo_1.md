## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Christian faith, a person is declared righteous through Jesus Christ. This is done by accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior, and by following His teachings and commands. The Bible teaches that Jesus came to save us from our sins and to make us holy and righteous. He died for our sins and was resurrected to give us eternal life. To be declared righteous, we must have faith in Jesus and receive Him into our hearts. We also need to repent of our sins and ask for forgiveness. Through this act of salvation, we are made righteous and become a new creation in Christ.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response addresses the concern by clearly stating that righteousness is declared through trust in Jesus and the imputation of His righteousness. It aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the essential role of faith in Jesus for achieving righteousness. However, it could be slightly improved by elaborating more on how this trust in Jesus leads to the cleansing of sins and the attribution of His righteousness.
