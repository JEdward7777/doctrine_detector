  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-structured answer with practical steps to ensure alignment between beliefs and actions. However, there was a slight focus on external actions and practices rather than on the internal heart examination and seeking God's guidance through prayer. Encouraging the student to emphasize the importance of sincere heart introspection and reliance on God's guidance would further strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
