It effectively addresses the concern of hypocrisy by emphasizing the need for authenticity and integrity in one's faith. The only potential area for improvement could be to include a reminder of the importance of seeking forgiveness and reconciliation in cases where one's actions have not aligned with their beliefs, to fully address the concern of potential loss of integrity."
