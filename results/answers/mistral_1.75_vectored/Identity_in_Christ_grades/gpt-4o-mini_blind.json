However, it would be more accurate if the reference to Matthew 26:39 was corrected since that verse actually pertains to Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane rather than God calling individuals by name. Additionally, incorporating more scriptural references that directly address God calling individuals by name (e.g., Isaiah 43:1) would strengthen the answer."
