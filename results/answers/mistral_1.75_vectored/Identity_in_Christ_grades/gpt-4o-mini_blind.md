## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
When God says "I have called you by name," it means that He has a special and unique relationship with you. He wants to bless and guide you in your life. He loves you unconditionally and wants to be a part of your life. He also wants to fulfill His purpose for you, which is to love and serve Him. This verse is found in the Bible in the book of Matthew, chapter 26, verse 39.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a generally correct understanding of the concept of being called by name by God, emphasizing the special relationship and purpose God has for each individual. However, it would be more accurate if the reference to Matthew 26:39 was corrected since that verse actually pertains to Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane rather than God calling individuals by name. Additionally, incorporating more scriptural references that directly address God calling individuals by name (e.g., Isaiah 43:1) would strengthen the answer.
