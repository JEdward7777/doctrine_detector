  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a good explanation of God's special relationship with individuals when He says \"I have called you by name.\" They accurately mentioned God's love and purpose for each believer. However, the student missed the key point regarding God's personal knowledge of each individual and His deliberate choice of them for a relationship. This response aligns well with a Christian worldview, but could be improved by focusing on the personal aspect of God knowing and choosing individuals."
