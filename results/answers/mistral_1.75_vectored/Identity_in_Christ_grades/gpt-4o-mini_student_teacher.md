## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
When God says "I have called you by name," it means that He has a special and unique relationship with you. He wants to bless and guide you in your life. He loves you unconditionally and wants to be a part of your life. He also wants to fulfill His purpose for you, which is to love and serve Him. This verse is found in the Bible in the book of Matthew, chapter 26, verse 39.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a good explanation of God's special relationship with individuals when He says "I have called you by name." They accurately mentioned God's love and purpose for each believer. However, the student missed the key point regarding God's personal knowledge of each individual and His deliberate choice of them for a relationship. This response aligns well with a Christian worldview, but could be improved by focusing on the personal aspect of God knowing and choosing individuals.
