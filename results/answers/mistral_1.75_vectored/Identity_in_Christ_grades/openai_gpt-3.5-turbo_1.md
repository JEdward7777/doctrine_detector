## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
When God says "I have called you by name," it means that He has a special and unique relationship with you. He wants to bless and guide you in your life. He loves you unconditionally and wants to be a part of your life. He also wants to fulfill His purpose for you, which is to love and serve Him. This verse is found in the Bible in the book of Matthew, chapter 26, verse 39.

Comment: The response effectively captures the essence of God's personal knowledge and calling of individuals, emphasizing the importance of a relationship with Him. It aligns well with the concern of understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. The only minor improvement would be to provide the correct verse reference for the quote, which is actually Isaiah 43:1.
