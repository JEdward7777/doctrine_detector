The connection to understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ is clearly addressed. However, the citation of the verse in Matthew 26:39 is incorrect; the verse actually relates to Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane. To improve, it would be beneficial to provide the correct reference or explore a more comprehensive explanation of how this concept relates to one's identity and value as a believer in Christ."
