## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
When God says "I have called you by name," it means that He has a special and unique relationship with you. He wants to bless and guide you in your life. He loves you unconditionally and wants to be a part of your life. He also wants to fulfill His purpose for you, which is to love and serve Him. This verse is found in the Bible in the book of Matthew, chapter 26, verse 39.

Comment: This response effectively captures the essence of God knowing each individual personally and choosing them for a relationship with Him, which aligns well with the Christian belief in God's personal care for His followers. The connection to understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ is clearly addressed. However, the citation of the verse in Matthew 26:39 is incorrect; the verse actually relates to Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane. To improve, it would be beneficial to provide the correct reference or explore a more comprehensive explanation of how this concept relates to one's identity and value as a believer in Christ.
