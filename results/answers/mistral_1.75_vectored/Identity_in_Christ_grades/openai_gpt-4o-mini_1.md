## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
When God says "I have called you by name," it means that He has a special and unique relationship with you. He wants to bless and guide you in your life. He loves you unconditionally and wants to be a part of your life. He also wants to fulfill His purpose for you, which is to love and serve Him. This verse is found in the Bible in the book of Matthew, chapter 26, verse 39.

Comment: The response effectively captures the essence of the given answer by explaining that God knows each individual personally and has chosen them for a relationship with Him. The focus on God's personal relationship with believers aligns well with understanding one's identity and value as a believer in Christ. The explanation could be strengthened by referencing the specific biblical passage accurately (Matthew 26:39 is about Jesus praying in the garden of Gethsemane, not God calling someone by name), but overall, the response conveys a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on God's personal relationship with believers.
