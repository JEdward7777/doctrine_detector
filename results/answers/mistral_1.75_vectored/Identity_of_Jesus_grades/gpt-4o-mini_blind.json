However, it could be further strengthened by incorporating references to key doctrinal beliefs such as Jesus being the Messiah, the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, and the importance of His death and resurrection for salvation. Additionally, a more robust explanation of Jesus's purpose in terms of fulfilling prophecies, atoning for sin, and restoring humanity's relationship with God would enhance the depth of the response."
