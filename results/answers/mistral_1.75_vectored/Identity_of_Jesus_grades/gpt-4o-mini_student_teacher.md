Comment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the significance of Jesus's name and His role as Savior. However, the student could have been more precise in stating that the name 'Jesus' means 'Yahweh saves,' focusing on His purpose to save people from their sins. The student's response captures important aspects but lacks the specific emphasis on salvation in relation to His name, which is crucial in understanding His core mission.
