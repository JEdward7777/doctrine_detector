  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is well-written and provides a concise overview of the beliefs of the Sadducees and Pharisees. However, it does not directly address the question of how these groups influenced the decision to crucify Jesus. The conclusion drawn about the motives of the Roman leaders is not supported by the provided text. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but lacks depth in its analysis."
