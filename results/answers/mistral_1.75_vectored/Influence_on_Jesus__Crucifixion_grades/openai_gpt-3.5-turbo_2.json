The relevance of this conflict for contemporary faith is touched upon, highlighting the importance of understanding the misguided actions of religious leaders even in modern times. However, the response could have delved deeper into how this conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders serves as a cautionary tale for Christians today, emphasizing the need for genuine faith, humility, and righteousness in leadership and followership within the Christian community."
