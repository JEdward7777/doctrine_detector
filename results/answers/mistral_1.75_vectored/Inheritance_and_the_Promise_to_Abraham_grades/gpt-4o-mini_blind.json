The mention of God's faithfulness to His promises is also in line with Christian theology. However, the answer could be strengthened by including specific references to biblical passages such as Genesis 12:1-3 and other relevant verses that detail the promises made to Abraham. This would provide a more comprehensive and doctrinally grounded answer."
