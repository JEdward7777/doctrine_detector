Comment: The response provides a solid Biblical understanding of the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus. It emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the key to inheriting eternal life while also highlighting the significance of loving and serving others, in line with Jesus' teachings. The only slight improvement could be to directly reference the specific teachings of Jesus, such as the parable of the Good Samaritan or the Great Commandment, to further illustrate the point.
