Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of following the teachings of Jesus, which aligns with the concern of clarifying the path to salvation as taught by Jesus. However, it could be improved by explicitly mentioning the role of faith in Jesus Christ as central to receiving eternal life according to Christian beliefs. Adding this element would provide a more comprehensive and accurate Christian perspective on salvation.
