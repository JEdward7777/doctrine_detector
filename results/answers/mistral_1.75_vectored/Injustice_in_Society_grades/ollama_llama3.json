  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response successfully addresses the concern by highlighting the need for Christian activism against injustice and promoting fairness based on biblical principles. The examples provided are relevant and diverse, covering various forms of inequality and harm. The response also provides clear guidance on how Christians can respond to these injustices, including praying, serving, speaking out, and sharing the love of Jesus.\n\nThe only area where this response falls short is in its lack of specific biblical references or application of biblical principles. While it mentions \"biblical principles,\" it does not provide explicit examples or scriptural backing for its claims. A stronger connection to Scripture could have strengthened the argument and provided a more compelling case for Christian activism against injustice.\n\nOverall, however, this response effectively addresses the concern and provides a clear call to action for Christians to engage in promoting fairness and combating injustice."
