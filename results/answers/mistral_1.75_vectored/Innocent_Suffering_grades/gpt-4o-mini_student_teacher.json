  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of how the concept of \"innocent blood\" is mentioned in the Bible and the implication it has on the value of life. They correctly reference the Holy Innocents and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific biblical teachings regarding the sanctity of life and the injustice of wrongful death, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, tying in more direct biblical references would have strengthened the argument."
