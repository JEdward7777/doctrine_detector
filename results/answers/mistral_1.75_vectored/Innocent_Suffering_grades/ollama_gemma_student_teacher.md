The concept of "innocent blood" is mentioned several times in the Bible. It refers to the blood of those who have been killed or persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ. This includes the blood of the Holy Innocents, who were persecuted by the Roman authorities during the time of Jesus.

The Bible also teaches that the blood of Jesus was shed for the forgiveness of sins. This implies that the value of life is very important to God, and that He loves us so much that He sent His Son to die for our salvation.

In addition, the Bible teaches that we are called to love one another and to protect the innocent. This means that we should always strive to be a part of the Body of Christ and to live out our Christian values in all that we do.

Overall, the concept of "innocent blood" reminds us of the importance of protecting and loving all people, regardless of their background or circumstances.
