  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately defines \"the last day\" as the day of judgment and fulfillment of God's promises in Christian teaching. It correctly highlights the joyous blessing for those who have accepted Jesus Christ, while also acknowledging judgment for those who have turned away from God. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the nature and extent of judgment and salvation."
