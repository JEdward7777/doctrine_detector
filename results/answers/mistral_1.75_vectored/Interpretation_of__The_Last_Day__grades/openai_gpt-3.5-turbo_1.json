However, it falls short in recognizing that \"the last day\" in Christian teachings also includes the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and the return of Jesus Christ. It is important to have a holistic understanding of this concept to fully grasp the significance of judgment in relation to one's faith and relationship with God."
