"Divine glory" is a term used in Christian worship to refer to the love, grace, and holiness of God. It is a way of expressing the deepest love and reverence for God, and it is meant to bring joy and peace to those who worship Him. In the Bible, Jesus said, "I am the Holy Spirit, sent to bring peace and joy to all who love me." (John 3:16). This verse teaches us that Jesus is the source of divine glory, and that He wants to fill us with His love and joy.

In worship, we are called to offer ourselves to God and to do everything we can to please Him. We are also called to pray for others and to share the love of Christ with them. When we do these things, we are fulfilling the commandment to love one another as Jesus loves us.

In addition to loving and serving others, we are also called to worship God in spirit and truth. This means that we should worship God in the way that He desires, according to His teachings and commands. We should also worship Him with sincerity and love, and with a desire to please Him above all else.
