  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40 \n\nComment: The student's answer lacks depth and provides a repetitive explanation of the concept of divine glory without addressing how it specifically relates to worship. There are also several instances of repeating the same content or Bible verse, which does not contribute to the clarity or coherence of the response. Additionally, there is a need for more theological and scriptural support to explain the concept of divine glory within the context of worship. The answer would benefit from a more focused and coherent explanation tying divine glory to worship practices and beliefs in a more developed manner."
