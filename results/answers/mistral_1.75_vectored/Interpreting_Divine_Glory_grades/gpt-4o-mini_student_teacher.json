  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer is well-intentioned and demonstrates a desire to understand and explain the concept of divine glory in the context of worship. However, the response lacks clarity and depth in its explanation. The student focused more on love, service, and the teachings of Jesus rather than explicitly addressing the nature of divine glory as the magnificent and radiant nature of God deserving of adoration. Moving forward, the student should strive to provide a more focused and in-depth analysis rooted in Christian teachings to convey a deeper understanding of divine glory in worship."
