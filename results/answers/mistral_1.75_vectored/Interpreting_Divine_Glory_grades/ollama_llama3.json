However, it could be improved by providing more biblical support for this concept, which is particularly important given the concern about recognizing God's glory in worship practices. Additionally, some of the sentences are repetitive or redundant, which makes the response feel a bit lengthy. Nevertheless, the response does a good job of highlighting the importance of divine glory in Christian worship and provides some practical applications for expressing reverence and awe towards God.\n\nThe only direct quote from Scripture provided is John 3:16, but it could be used more effectively to support the concept of divine glory. Furthermore, the response could benefit from more explanation on how recognizing God's glory affects one's relationship with Him and others."
