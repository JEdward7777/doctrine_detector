  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response does a good job in explaining the concept of \"divine glory\" as the magnificent and radiant nature of God deserving of adoration and worship. However, the lack of direct engagement with the concern provided (recognizing God's glory in worship practices) and some repetition in the response lower the grade slightly. The mention of Jesus as the source of divine glory and the importance of loving others and worshiping God in spirit and truth are relevant but could have been more directly tied to the concern raised."
