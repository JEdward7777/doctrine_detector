  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks accuracy and coherence with the Biblical origin of the name \"Israel.\" The student incorrectly associates the name \"Israel\" with various references to Jesus Christ, Old Testament scriptures, commandments, and promises, which are not directly related to the meaning of the name. Additionally, the student's response is excessively repetitive and lacks a clear explanation of the significance of the name based on its Biblical origin. The student needs improvement in their understanding of Biblical names and their meanings."
