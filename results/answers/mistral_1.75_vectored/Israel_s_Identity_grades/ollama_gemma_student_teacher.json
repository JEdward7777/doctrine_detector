  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer provides a comprehensive interpretation of the biblical origin of the name \"Israel,\" referencing the Hebrew meaning \"Yesha\" and its connection to the Israelites. However, it could benefit from additional clarity in explaining the significance of the struggle with God in the context of the name's meaning. Additionally, the student's elaborate quotation from Jesus is not directly relevant to the question and could be trimmed down."
