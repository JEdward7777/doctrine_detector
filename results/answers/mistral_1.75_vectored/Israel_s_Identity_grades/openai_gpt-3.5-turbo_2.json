  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response went off track by providing excessive and repetitive content that did not directly address the concern of understanding the significance of biblical names and their meanings. While some elements of biblical references were mentioned, the bulk of the response was unrelated and did not effectively explain the significance of the name \"Israel.\" The response lacked a clear focus and relevant explanation, resulting in a lower grade."
