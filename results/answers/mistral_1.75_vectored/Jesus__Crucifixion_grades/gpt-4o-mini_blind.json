However, the response could be improved by emphasizing the historical and biblical significance of myrrh, such as its association with burial and embalming, which adds depth to the understanding of Jesus' sacrificial love. Additionally, a stronger connection to the specific experience of Jesus on the cross, such as the pain-relieving properties of myrrh, would enhance the overall explanation."
