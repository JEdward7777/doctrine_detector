  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful explanation of the symbolism behind the offer of wine mixed with myrrh, emphasizing Jesus' sacrifice and love for his followers. However, the student missed the important aspect of Jesus' refusal of the offer, which reflects his full acceptance of his sacrificial role and commitment to his mission. The student demonstrated a good understanding of Christian symbolism, but could deepen their analysis by incorporating the teacher's reference answer."
