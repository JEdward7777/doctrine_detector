The explanation could be further strengthened by emphasizing Jesus as the embodiment of resurrection and life itself, not just as the source but as the very essence of these concepts. Additionally, discussing the implications for believers in terms of their spiritual rebirth and eternal security could enrich the answer. Overall, a solid interpretation with room for deeper theological exploration."
