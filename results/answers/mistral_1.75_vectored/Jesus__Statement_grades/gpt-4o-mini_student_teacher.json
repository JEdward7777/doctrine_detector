  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a strong explanation of Jesus being the source of eternal life and salvation, as well as emphasizing His victory over sin and death. The student effectively connected Jesus' statement to the concept of resurrection and new life in Him. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly highlighting Jesus as the source and cause of resurrection, as emphasized in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of Jesus' statement in relation to faith and theological understanding."
