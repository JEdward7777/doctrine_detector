  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies Jesus as the source of eternal life and salvation, which aligns with the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. The mention of Jesus being the resurrector of those who believe in Him also shows an understanding of Jesus' ultimate victory over sin and death.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting Jesus' statement to the broader biblical narrative of salvation and redemption. Additionally, while the phrase \"Resurrection and the Life\" is mentioned, it's not fully explained or elaborated on, which might leave some readers wondering about the significance of this specific title for Jesus.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding Jesus' role in resurrection, but could be strengthened by further development and connection to the broader biblical narrative."
