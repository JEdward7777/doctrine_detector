It addresses the concern by underscoring the importance of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection for faith and theological understanding from a Christian worldview. However, additional emphasis on Jesus being the source of eternal life and salvation, as well as the conqueror of sin and death, could have further enriched the response."
