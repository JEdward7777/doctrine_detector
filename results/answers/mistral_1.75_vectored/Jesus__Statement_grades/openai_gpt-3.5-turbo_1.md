Comment: The response effectively conveys the meaning behind Jesus' statement that He is the Resurrection and the Life, emphasizing His role as the source of resurrection. It addresses the concern by underscoring the importance of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection for faith and theological understanding from a Christian worldview. However, additional emphasis on Jesus being the source of eternal life and salvation, as well as the conqueror of sin and death, could have further enriched the response.
