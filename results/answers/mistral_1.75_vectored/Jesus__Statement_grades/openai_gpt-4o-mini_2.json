  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response captures the essence of Jesus being the source of resurrection and new life in Him, aligning well with the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection. It effectively conveys an important aspect of Christian faith and theology. However, to improve the grade, more emphasis could have been placed on the significance of Jesus' role in providing eternal life and the victory over sin and death."
