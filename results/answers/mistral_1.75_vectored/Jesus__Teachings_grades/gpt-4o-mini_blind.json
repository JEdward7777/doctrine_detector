However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies in the example provided. The verse referenced is not an instance where Jesus used \"Amen\" to emphasize His teachings. Additionally, the quote in the answer is not accurately attributed to Jesus. The response would benefit from more precise references and a deeper explanation of the significance of \"Amen\" in Jesus's teachings."
