## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Jesus used the term "Amen" to emphasize His teachings as a way of affirming and blessing His teachings. He would say, "I am fulfilling this commandment that is most important of all: 'Love the Lord your Almourer, and love others as yourself.'" (Matthew 22:37). This was a way for Jesus to bless and affirm his teachings and to remind us to do the same.
