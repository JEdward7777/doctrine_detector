However, it could be more accurate in highlighting the specific ways Jesus used \"Amen\", such as blessing and affirming His teachings, as mentioned in the original response. Additionally, while the concern is about recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture, the response does not explicitly mention this aspect, which limits its effectiveness in addressing the concern.\n\nTo improve, the response could provide more specific examples of how Jesus used \"Amen\" to emphasize His teachings, and also explicitly acknowledge the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture."
