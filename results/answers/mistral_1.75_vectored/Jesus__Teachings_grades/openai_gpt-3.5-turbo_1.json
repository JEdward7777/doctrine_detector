  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately recognizes the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture by explaining how Jesus used the term \"Amen\" to emphasize the truth of what He said. It acknowledges the importance of Jesus' teachings and how He affirmed them. The only minor deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the biblical reference in the given answer as a way to strengthen the biblical foundation of Jesus' authority in teachings. Overall, a solid explanation from a Christian worldview perspective."
