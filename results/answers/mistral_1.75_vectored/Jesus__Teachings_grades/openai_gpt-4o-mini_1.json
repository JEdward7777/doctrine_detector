It appropriately connects this practice to the recognition of Jesus' authority in Scripture. The only minor deduction is that the response does not directly address the specific example provided in Matthew 22:37, but overall, it effectively captures the essence of Jesus' use of \"Amen\" in affirming His teachings."
