  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides some understanding of Jesus' role as the sacrificial Lamb and emphasizes his significance in fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and bringing forgiveness and salvation. However, the answer lacks clarity and specificity in linking Jesus to the priesthood and the impact on sacrifices made by human priests. The student could improve by connecting Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice and great high priest who intercedes for believers, highlighting the cessation of the need for further sacrifices by human priests due to Jesus' atoning sacrifice."
