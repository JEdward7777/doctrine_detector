However, it could have delved deeper into the specific aspects of Jesus' priesthood, such as his role as the mediator between God and humanity, and how his sacrifice fulfilled the requirements of the Old Testament law in a more comprehensive manner. Overall, the explanation connects Jesus' sacrificial role well with his priestly role, but could benefit from expanding on the theological implications further."
