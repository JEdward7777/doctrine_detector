The focus on Jesus as the great high priest who intercedes for us in God's presence is clear and aligns well with the Christian belief in Jesus' redemptive work. The connection to the priesthood is well explained, showcasing a solid understanding of the significance of Jesus' role in fulfilling and surpassing the Old Testament priesthood system. Overall, a strong and well-supported response."
