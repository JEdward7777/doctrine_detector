Jesus is described as the ultimate and perfect High Priest in the New Testament. He is said to have been sent to fulfill the promises of the Old Testament, including the promise of a Messiah who would be a servant and a sacrifice for all people. Jesus is also described as having a sinless life, and his death and resurrection are seen as a sacrificial act that fulfilled the requirements of the Old Testament law.
