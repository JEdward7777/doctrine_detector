It touches on the theological significance of Jesus' role as the ultimate and perfect High Priest in fulfilling the promises of the Old Testament. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of Jesus' sacrificial act and its implications for believers. Great job in incorporating Christian theology into the explanation."
