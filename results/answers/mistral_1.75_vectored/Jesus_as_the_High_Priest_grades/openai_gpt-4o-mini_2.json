The incorporation of the sacrificial aspect and universal impact of Jesus' role as High Priest aligns well with Christian beliefs and emphasizes the significance of Jesus' redemptive work for humanity. However, more elaboration on how Jesus fulfills the role of High Priest in terms of mediation, intercession, and atonement could further deepen the theological exploration."
