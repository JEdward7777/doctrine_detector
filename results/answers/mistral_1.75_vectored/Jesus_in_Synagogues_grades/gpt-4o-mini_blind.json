However, the answer lacks depth and specific examples from Scripture to support these points. It would have been stronger with more precise references to Jesus' interactions with the synagogue, His teachings in that setting, and how those interactions fulfilled prophecies. Incorporating more biblical references and details would have improved the response significantly."
