It is important to remember that Jesus is not just a symbol or a name, but a person who has been sent to save us from sin and bring peace and love to all people. Therefore, it is important to communicate this message of love and salvation in a way that honors and respects all people, regardless of their background or beliefs.

In a context where political leaders are also called "lord," it is important to remember that Jesus is the ultimate Lord and Savior, and that His love and teachings should guide our actions and decisions. We can communicate this message by praying for guidance and wisdom in how we treat others, and by seeking to serve and love others as Jesus did.

It is also important to remember that Jesus' message of love and forgiveness is meant for everyone, including those who may have wronged us or who may have different beliefs. We can communicate this message by speaking and acting in a loving and forgiving manner, even when we may be hurt or offended.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to share the love and teachings of Jesus with others, and to live out these teachings in a way that brings joy and peace to all people.
