  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 75.\n\nWhile the student mentions important aspects of communicating the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also called \"lord,\" such as emphasizing Jesus as the ultimate Lord and Savior, love, forgiveness, and serving others, the answer lacks specificity in addressing the potential conflict in terminology and distinction between the lordship of Jesus and political leaders. Additionally, the response could have further emphasized the uniqueness and exclusivity of Jesus as Lord in a world where various entities may claim authority.\n\nOverall, the student's answer shows a good understanding of the importance of representing Jesus as Lord in all circumstances, but it could benefit from deeper theological reflection and clarity on the distinctiveness of Jesus' lordship in a world where other titles are used."
