  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response emphasizes the importance of love, compassion, and forgiveness, which are indeed crucial aspects of Christianity. However, the student's answer fails to directly address the specific concern of differentiating between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student should have focused more on explaining the significance of 'Jesus is Lord' in a context where political leaders are also addressed as 'lord', highlighting Jesus' unique and supreme authority."
