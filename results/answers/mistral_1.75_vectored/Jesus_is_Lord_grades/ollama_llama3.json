  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately addresses the concern of differentiating Jesus' divine lordship from earthly titles, emphasizing that while human leaders may be called \"lord,\" Jesus is the ultimate Lord and Savior. The writer also highlights the importance of communicating Jesus' message in a way that honors and respects all people, regardless of their background or beliefs.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response could be more explicit in its explanation of what it means for Jesus to be \"Lord.\" While the response touches on this point, it could be further developed with additional biblical references or examples to illustrate the significance of Jesus' divine authority and supremacy. Additionally, some readers may still struggle to fully differentiate between Jesus' lordship and earthly titles without a more detailed explanation.\n\nOverall, the response is strong in its emphasis on the importance of communicating Jesus' message and differentiating His divine lordship from human rulers, but could benefit from further development and clarification."
