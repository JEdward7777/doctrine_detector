While it attempts to provide context to explain the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God, it falls short of directly addressing the concern of maintaining Biblical accuracy in translation. It is important to more explicitly convey the specific Christian belief about Jesus being the Son of God in a Muslim context."
