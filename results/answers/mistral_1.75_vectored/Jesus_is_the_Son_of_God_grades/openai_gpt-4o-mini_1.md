## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## [Answer](../Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet and a messenger of God. However, it is important to remember that in Christianity, Jesus is also considered the Son of God.

In a Muslim context, you could say "Jesus is a beloved servant of God" or "Jesus is a prophet and a servant of God." These statements emphasize the importance of Jesus as a servant of God and his role as a prophet, while also acknowledging his role as the Son of God in Christianity.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response does not directly translate the phrase "Jesus is the Son of God" using the original terminology as requested. While it attempts to provide context to explain the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God, it falls short of directly addressing the concern of maintaining Biblical accuracy in translation. It is important to more explicitly convey the specific Christian belief about Jesus being the Son of God in a Muslim context.
