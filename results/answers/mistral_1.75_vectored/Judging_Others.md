The Bible teaches that Christians should judge each other in love and with the Holy Spirit. Jesus said, "Let us love one another, just as Christ loved me, and I will be with you always." (John 3:16). He also said, "If anyone has a sin to share, let us pray for you and help you to love and forgive each other. (Ephesians 2:7-8).

In Matthew 7:7-8, Jesus taught, "And whoever wants to become like Jesus must love the Lord Jesus and serve him. And whoever loves the Lord Jesus will be blessed and fulfilled. This is a fulfillment of the Lord's commandment to love one another, as Jesus loves us.

Jesus also taught us to forgive our brothers and sisters in Christ. He said, "For we have been forgiven by the Holy Spirit, so we should also forgive anyone who has done wrong to us. (Colossians 2:7).

In addition to loving and forgiving each other, Christians are also called to pray for one another. Jesus said, "And pray that the Holy Spirit will come upon you to fill you with peace and joy and love and peace. (Luke 2:46).

It is important to remember that Christians are called to be humble and servant-hearted, and to treat others with kindness and respect. As Jesus said, "Love your neighbor as yourself, and love the Lord our Savior. (Matthew 22:39).
