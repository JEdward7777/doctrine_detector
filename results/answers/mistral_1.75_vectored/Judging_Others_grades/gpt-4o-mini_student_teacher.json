  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant Bible verses, but the answer is not directly addressing the concern of learning how to approach relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner. The focus of the student's response is more on aspects of love, forgiveness, and prayer rather than specifically addressing how Christians should judge each other. There is room for improvement in connecting the Biblical instructions on judging others with the broader context of Christian relationships."
