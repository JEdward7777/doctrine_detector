  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response correctly emphasizes the importance of not harshly judging or condemning one another, in line with the given answer and concern. However, the scriptural references provided are somewhat misquoted and not directly related to the concern of approaching relationships within the Christian community in a Christ-like manner. The response could have been more focused and accurate in addressing the specific concern provided."
