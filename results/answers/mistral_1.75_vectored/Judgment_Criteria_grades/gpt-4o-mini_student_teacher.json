  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid understanding of the biblical perspective on judgment, emphasizing love for Jesus Christ and obedience to His teachings. The response incorporates relevant scripture references and highlights the importance of love, forgiveness, repentance, and service in the Christian faith. However, the answer could have focused more directly on aligning individual actions and lives with the righteous character of Christ, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrates a good grasp of the topic, but there is room for a stronger connection to the specified concern."
