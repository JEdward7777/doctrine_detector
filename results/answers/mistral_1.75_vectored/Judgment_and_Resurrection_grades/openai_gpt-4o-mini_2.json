While the content provided is relevant to Christian beliefs and practices, it does not directly address the concern of clarifying the events related to judgment of sinners, resurrection, and the establishment of the Lord's rule during this significant eschatological time. To improve, the response should have included more details or explanations related to these specific events as requested in the concern."
