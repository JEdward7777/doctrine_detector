"And whoever wants to be like me must also love me deeply. And I will give you a new commandment: that you love one another, just as I have loved you.

Anyone who loves has been given a gift of the Holy Spirit.

Jesus said, “Love the Lord your Father, and love me, and love the Holy Spirit.

If anyone loves me, they will be filled with the Holy Spirit.

I will give you a new commandment: that you love one another, just as I have loved you.

Jesus said, “Love the Lord your Father, and love me, and love the Holy Spirit.

If anyone loves me, they will be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
