  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response contains significant inaccuracies and theological errors. The student misquoted and misinterpreted Bible verses, mixing up the words of Jesus and attributing false teachings to Him. Additionally, the response lacks coherence and clarity. It fails to address the essence of Jesus' teaching on pointing out faults in others in relation to our own faults. The student needs to revisit the Scriptures and focus on accurately representing Jesus' teachings on love, forgiveness, and humility."
