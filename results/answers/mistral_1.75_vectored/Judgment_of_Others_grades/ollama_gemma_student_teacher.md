## [Answer](../Judgment_of_Others.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Jesus teaches us to love and forgive others as He loves and forgives us. In Matthew 7:7-12, Jesus says:

"And whoever wants to be like me must also love me deeply. And I will give you a new commandment: that you love one another, just as I have loved you.

Anyone who loves has been given a gift of the Holy Spirit.

Jesus said, “Love the Lord your Father, and love me, and love the Holy Spirit.

If anyone loves me, they will be filled with the Holy Spirit.

I will give you a new commandment: that you love one another, just as I have loved you.

Anyone who loves has been given a gift of the Holy Spirit.

Jesus said, “Love the Lord your Father, and love me, and love the Holy Spirit.

If anyone loves me, they will be filled with the Holy Spirit.”

In this passage, Jesus emphasizes the importance of loving and serving others as He loves and serves us. He also teaches us to forgive others as He forgives us. In Matthew 7:13-14, Jesus says:

“And if you want to be blessed, then fulfill this commandment: ‘Love the Lord your Holy Father, and I will fulfill this commandment for you.

‘And I will give you a new commandment: that you love one another, just as I have loved you.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 85/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the question by referencing relevant scripture passages from Matthew 7 to support their claims. They clearly articulate Jesus' teachings on loving and forgiving others as well as the importance of humility and self-reflection before pointing out the faults of others. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of "removing the plank from our own eye" as a metaphor for addressing our own shortcomings before criticizing others.
