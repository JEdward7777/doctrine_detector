  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student accurately referenced a passage where Jesus teaches about removing the plank from one's own eye before criticizing others, showing an understanding of the importance of self-reflection and humility. However, the response lacks cohesion and relevance to the concern provided. The quoted response from Matthew 7:7-12 emphasizes loving and forgiving others rather than addressing the concern of potential hypocrisy in criticizing others while ignoring one's own faults. The student needs to connect the teachings of Jesus to the concern provided to strengthen their argument and demonstrate a clearer application of Christian principles in addressing the issue at hand."
