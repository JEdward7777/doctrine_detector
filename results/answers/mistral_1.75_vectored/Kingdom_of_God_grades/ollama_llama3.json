  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response acknowledges the concern about losing depth and biblical context, but still suggests rephrasing the term \"Kingdom of God\" for cultures without a concept of kingdoms. While it does provide some biblical context by emphasizing Jesus as the true King of Heaven, it does not fully address the concern that retaining the original phrase can help readers understand its spiritual and eschatological significance.\n\nThe response's main strength is its recognition that cultural sensitivity is important in translation, which shows an understanding of the concern. However, it could have gone further to argue why rephrasing might not be the best approach, or how providing explanations about the term's significance can help readers without a concept of kingdoms. Overall, while this response makes some good points, it does not fully address the concern and therefore earns a grade of 80."
