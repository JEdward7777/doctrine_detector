  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a strong argument against rephrasing \"Kingdom of God\" by emphasizing the importance of retaining the term and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance. It correctly points out the risk of losing the depth and biblical context of the term through rephrasing. The focus on preserving the biblical authenticity and significance is commendable from a Christian worldview perspective."
