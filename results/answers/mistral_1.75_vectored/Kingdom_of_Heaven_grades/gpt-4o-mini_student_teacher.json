  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation regarding the importance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"Kingdom of Heaven\" in emphasizing the spiritual nature of the kingdom and its ultimate goal for Christians, they did not directly address the uniqueness of this term in the Gospel of Matthew and its specific theological implications. The student's answer adequately conveys the spiritual significance of the term \"heaven,\" but lacks the focus on the distinctive nature and theological depth that the reference answer emphasizes. Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic with room for further improvement in aligning their response more closely with the concern provided."
