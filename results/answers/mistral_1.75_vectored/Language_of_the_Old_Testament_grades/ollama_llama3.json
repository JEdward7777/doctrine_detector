  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 75.\n\nWhile the student's statement is largely accurate, it lacks precision and nuance compared to the ideal answer. The phrase \"primarily written in Hebrew\" implies that some parts may not have been written in Hebrew, which is not entirely true (the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with a small portion in Aramaic). Additionally, the concern emphasizes the importance of understanding the original context of Scripture, which requires more than just a simple statement about the language used.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest rephrasing it to something like: \"The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with some portions also written in Aramaic.\" This revised response demonstrates a greater level of precision and understanding of the concern."
