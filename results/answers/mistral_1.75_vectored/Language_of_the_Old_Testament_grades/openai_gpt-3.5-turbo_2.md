Comment: The response is accurate and acknowledges that the majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, which is essential for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context. The slight deduction is due to the use of the phrase "vast majority" instead of stating definitively that the entire Old Testament was written in Hebrew.
