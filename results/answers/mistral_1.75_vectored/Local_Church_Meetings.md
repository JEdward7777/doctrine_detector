The Bible does not provide specific instructions on how the early Christians should meet. However, the New Testament provides several examples of how the early Christians met and prayed together.

In Acts 2:42-47, we see that the early Christians devoted themselves to the apostles' teachings, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer. They also devoted themselves to the apostles' teachings, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.

In Acts 2:46, it says "And they came together to break bread and pray, and to share the Lord's Holy Communion." This suggests that the early Christians met regularly for prayer and to celebrate the Lord's Supremum.

In Acts 2:42, it says "And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teachings, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer." This suggests that the early Christians also met to study the Bible and to pray together.

In Acts 2:43, it says "And they went to the early Christians and received guidance to help them grow in their faith. And they added to the Lord's commands that Jesus Christ would always be with them.

This suggests that the early Christians also met to receive guidance and encouragement from one another.

It is important to note that these verses are specific to the early Christian community in Jerusalem and may not apply to all Christian communities today.
