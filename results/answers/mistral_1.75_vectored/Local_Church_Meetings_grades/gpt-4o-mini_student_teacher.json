While the response accurately discussed the practices of early Christians in prayer, fellowship, and studying Scripture, it missed addressing the specific concern of fostering local fellowship among believers. The focus on meeting for prayer, sharing the Lord's Supper, and studying the Bible is important, but the emphasis on gathering in someone's home to encourage and strengthen relationships within the local community was lacking. Encouraging more explicit connections to fostering fellowship among believers would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
