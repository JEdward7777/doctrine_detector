  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and thoughtful response that correctly points out that the New Testament provides several examples of how the early Christians met and prayed together. It also acknowledges the possibility that practices may vary across different communities. The response provides relevant textual evidence from Acts to support the claim that early Christians often met in homes for prayer and scripture discussions."
