  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of how early Christians met and prayed together based on biblical examples. The explanation of Acts 2:42-47 aligns well with the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers, showing the importance of meeting together for prayer, studying scripture, and receiving guidance and encouragement. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly tie the explanation back to the concern in a more explicit manner."
