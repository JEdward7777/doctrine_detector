The connection to Romans 8:23 is effectively discussed, emphasizing the anticipation for the fulfillment of this promise in the Christian life. However, there could have been a clearer articulation of the theological significance of this future adoption and how it shapes believers' present lives and understanding of their identity in Christ."
