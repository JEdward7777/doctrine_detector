## [Answer](../Looking_Forward_to_Adoption.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Romans 8:23 says, "I am eagerly waiting for the fulfillment of the promise of the Holy Spirit to become a part of me." This verse is a prayerful statement of the Christian's desire to be filled with the Holy Spirit. It also implies that the Holy Spirit is already present in believers, but that they are still waiting for the fullness of the Holy Spirit to come upon them.

This verse also speaks to the Christian's desire to be adopted into God's family. The Holy Spirit is sent to help us live according to the will of Jesus Christ, which includes being filled with the Holy Spirit. As believers, we are called to be holy and to love one another as Jesus loves us. This is a promise that is fulfilled through the Holy Spirit.

In addition to this, the Holy Spirit is also a symbol of the Holy Spirit's presence in the Christian life. The Holy Spirit is a gift from God that is given to all who believe in Jesus Christ. It is a reminder of the love and forgiveness that Jesus has given us.

So, Romans 8:23 teaches us that we are eagerly waiting for the fulfillment of the promise of the Holy Spirit to become a part of us. This means that we are eagerly waiting for the Holy Spirit to fill us with His love and guidance. It also reminds us that we are called to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to live according to the will of Jesus Christ.
