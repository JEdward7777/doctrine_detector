However, the answer would benefit from a more specific emphasis on how the Lord's Supper specifically commemorates the Passover meal Jesus shared with his disciples, where he symbolized his body and blood as a sacrifice for sin. Encouragement to deepen their understanding of the historical context and theological significance of the Lord's Supper would improve their answer."
