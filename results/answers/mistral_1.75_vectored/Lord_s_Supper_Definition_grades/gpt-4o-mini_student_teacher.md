Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a good understanding of the Lord's Supper as a symbolic act representing Jesus Christ's love and sacrifice, as well as its significance in strengthening commitment to follow Him. However, the answer would benefit from a more specific emphasis on how the Lord's Supper specifically commemorates the Passover meal Jesus shared with his disciples, where he symbolized his body and blood as a sacrifice for sin. Encouragement to deepen their understanding of the historical context and theological significance of the Lord's Supper would improve their answer.
