  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately describes the symbolic significance of the Lord's Supper as a representation of Christ's love and sacrifice. However, it lacks the specific reference to the Passover meal as the historical context of the Lord's Supper, which is mentioned in the reference answer. Including this additional detail would strengthen the student's understanding and explanation of the sacrament."
