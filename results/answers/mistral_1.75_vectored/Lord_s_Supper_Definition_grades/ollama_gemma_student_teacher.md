The Lord's Supper, also known as Holy Communion, is a Christian sacrament that is deeply symbolic and is meant to represent the love and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. It is believed to be a spiritual preparation for the Lord’s coming to fulfill the promise of salvation. The Lord’s Supper is also a reminder of the sacrifice Jesus made for us, his followers, and is a way to strengthen and renew our commitment to follow Him.

**Grade: 80/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately describes the symbolic significance of the Lord's Supper as a representation of Christ's love and sacrifice. However, it lacks the specific reference to the Passover meal as the historical context of the Lord's Supper, which is mentioned in the reference answer. Including this additional detail would strengthen the student's understanding and explanation of the sacrament.
