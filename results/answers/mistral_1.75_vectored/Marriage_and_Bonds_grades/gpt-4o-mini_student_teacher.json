  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60  \n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good overview of the significance of the bond of marriage from a Christian perspective, emphasizing love, commitment, and serving God together. However, the excessive repetition of Bible verses towards the end detracts from the coherence of the response and does not effectively address the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages. The student could have focused more on practical ways for couples to uphold their commitment to each other within the context of honoring God's design for relationships."
