## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
The answer provided in the response is accurate in stating that the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the New Testament books of Matthew, Luke, and Mark. However, there is a slight oversight in the description of the order in which the disciples are listed. According to the Gospel accounts, the names of the twelve disciples are listed in Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, Luke 6:14-16, and Acts 1:13. The mention of the order of the seven Beatitudes in Matthew and Luke is not directly related to the listing of the disciples.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately identifies the books where the names of the twelve disciples are listed but slightly misrepresents the order in which they are presented in the Gospels. It is important to clarify this to avoid confusion in the understanding of the biblical accounts.
