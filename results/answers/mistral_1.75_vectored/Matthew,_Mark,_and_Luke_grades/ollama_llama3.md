80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 80.

The response provides accurate information about the location of the list of disciples in the New Testament, mentioning three books (Matthew, Luke, and Mark) where the list appears. However, it does not provide the specific details about the order of the list mentioned in the original response. The concern "Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings" emphasizes the importance of understanding the context and specific details found within these accounts.

To receive a higher grade, the response could have provided more detailed information about the lists in each book, such as mentioning that Matthew and Luke present the list in the order of the Beatitudes.
