Comment: The response correctly identifies that the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which aligns with a Christian worldview. However, the response lacks depth and specific details related to the concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. Further elaboration on the significance of the twelve disciples in relation to the teachings of Jesus would strengthen the response.
