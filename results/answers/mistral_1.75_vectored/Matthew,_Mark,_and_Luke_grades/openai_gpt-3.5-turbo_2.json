  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response correctly identifies that the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which is accurate. However, the response lacks depth and understanding of the specific order and significance of the disciples' names in relation to the teachings and accounts found in the Gospels. Further exploration and explanation of the disciples' roles and how they reflect the teachings of Jesus in the Gospel accounts would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
