Comment: The response correctly identifies that the names of the twelve disciples are listed in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, which aligns with the concern of being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings. However, the response lacks specific details about the order in which the disciples are listed in each Gospel, which would have demonstrated a deeper understanding of the texts.
