Grade: 70

Comment: The response correctly identifies the books where the list of the twelve disciples can be found, but it lacks depth in understanding the significance of the disciples in relation to the Gospel teachings. More insight into the roles and teachings of the disciples in spreading the Gospel message would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
