The term "Messiah" has its roots in the Jewish Bible and is used to refer to a prophetic figure who will come to fulfill God's promises and bring salvation to the people. In Christianity, Jesus is considered the Messiah who fulfilled these promises and brought salvation to all people. However, in other Christian traditions, such as the Orthodox Church, the Messianic hope continues to be fulfilled through the coming of the Holy Spirit and the establishment of the Kingdom of God. In Islam, the Messiah is also mentioned in the Quran and is seen as a prophet and messenger of God who will come to guide and protect his followers. In this context, the term "Messiah" has different religious expectations and is associated with different teachings and beliefs.
