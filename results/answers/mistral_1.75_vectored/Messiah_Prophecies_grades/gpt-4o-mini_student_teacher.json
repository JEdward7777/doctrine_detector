While they attempted to list prophecies and how Jesus fulfilled them, the majority of their points were repetitive and not aligned with biblical references. Additionally, the student did not address the significance of these prophecies in strengthening faith in Jesus as the Messiah. More focus on providing accurate and relevant information, as well as connecting it to the importance of fulfilled prophecies, would greatly improve their answer."
