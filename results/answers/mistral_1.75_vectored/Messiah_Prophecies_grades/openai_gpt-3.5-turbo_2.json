The concerns about understanding the significance of these prophecies to strengthen faith in Jesus as the Messiah are not adequately addressed. The response could benefit from further explanation and analysis of how these prophecies point to Jesus fulfilling the role of the promised Messiah in a way that would deepen faith and understanding."
