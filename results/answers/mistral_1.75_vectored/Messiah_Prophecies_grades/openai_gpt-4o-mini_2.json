However, the response loses coherence towards the end, repeating the same points multiple times. This repetition detracts from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the explanation. Additionally, a deeper analysis and discussion on how these prophecies strengthen faith in Jesus as the Messiah would have enhanced the response."
