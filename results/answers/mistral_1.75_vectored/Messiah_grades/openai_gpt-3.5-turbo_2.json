Instead, it provides a broad overview of the concept of Messiah across different religions without emphasizing the distinctiveness of Jesus as the fulfillment of biblical prophecies. To improve, the response should center more explicitly on the uniqueness of Jesus as the Messiah in Christianity, in contrast to other religious beliefs, while remaining faithful to scriptural teachings."
