  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response correctly identifies that \"minister\" means to serve others, which aligns with the biblical definition. It also highlights the importance of serving both spiritual and physical needs, which is consistent with Jesus' teachings in Matthew 25:31-46. Additionally, the response mentions teaching others about God, which is an essential aspect of ministry.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples from Scripture that support its claims. For instance, it would be helpful to cite passages like John 13:34-35, where Jesus commands us to love one another as He has loved us, or Romans 15:1-7, which emphasizes the importance of ministering to others' needs.\n\nOverall, while the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical definition of ministry, it could be strengthened by incorporating more scriptural support and examples."
