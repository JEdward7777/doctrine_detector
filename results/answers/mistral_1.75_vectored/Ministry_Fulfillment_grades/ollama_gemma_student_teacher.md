**Comments:**

The student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern. It clearly outlines various ways in which fulfilling one's ministry as a Christian involves serving and loving others. The inclusion of specific actions like sharing the Bible, praying, and living a life reflecting Christian values aligns well with the teacher's reference answer. 

However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of "divine purpose" and its connection to serving others. Additionally, the student's answer lacks a direct connection to the Christian worldview, specifically referencing scripture or theological concepts.
