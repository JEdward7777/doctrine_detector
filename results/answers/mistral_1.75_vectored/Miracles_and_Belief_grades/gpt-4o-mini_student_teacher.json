  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general perspective on miracles as signs of God's love and blessings, emphasizing their spiritual and practical benefits. However, the answer lacks a clear connection to how miracles specifically lead to belief in God, as stated in the concern. The student could improve by focusing more on how miracles demonstrate God's power and validity, prompting belief in Him as the reference answer suggests."
