  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nWhile the original answer focused more on the role of miracles as indicators of God's power, this response explores additional aspects of miracles, such as their impact on building faith and trust in God, sharing the love of Jesus with others, and bringing physical healing and comfort. The concern about understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith is also addressed.\n\nHowever, the original answer did provide a clear biblical basis for the importance of miracles, which this response does not fully incorporate. Additionally, some of the points made in this response, such as sharing the love of Jesus with others through prayer and evangelism, while important, may not be directly related to the concern about understanding the role of miracles in leading others to faith.\n\nOverall, this response provides a good summary of the importance of miracles, but could benefit from a more direct connection to the original answer and the concern being addressed."
