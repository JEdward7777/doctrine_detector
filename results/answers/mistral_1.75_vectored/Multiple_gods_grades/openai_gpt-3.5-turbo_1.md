## [Answer](../Multiple_gods.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Missionaries should address this misconception by emphasizing the importance of the Holy Trinity and the unity of God in Christianity. They can explain that Jesus is not a separate god, but rather a part of the Holy Trinity, which includes Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Father. They can also share verses from the Bible that affirm the love and unity of God, such as John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever loves him will be blessed." Missionaries can also pray for guidance and wisdom to help them share these teachings with others.
