  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10/100\n\nComment: The student's response lacks substance and coherence. It appears to be mostly a repetition of phrases rather than a coherent explanation of the significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth. The repetition detracts from the overall clarity and understanding of the answer. Additionally, there is a lack of depth and contextual understanding of the significance of myrrh in the biblical context. The response would benefit greatly from a clear, focused explanation rooted in biblical teachings."
