  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a clear explanation that connects the significance of myrrh to Jesus' future suffering and death.\n* References the symbolism of myrrh as representing sacrifice, aligning with the role of the Messiah.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The response lacks additional elaboration on the historical or theological significance of myrrh beyond its symbolic representation.\n* The prayer at the beginning of the response is unrelated to the question and clutters the response.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could enhance their answer by elaborating on the traditional or biblical interpretations of myrrh as a symbol of suffering and sacrifice.\n* It would be beneficial to remove the unrelated prayer from the response to maintain clarity and focus on the question."
