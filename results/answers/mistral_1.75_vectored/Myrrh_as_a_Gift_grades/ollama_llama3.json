  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nThe main issue with this response is that it doesn't address the concern about understanding the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus and its significance in deepening one's appreciation of his purpose and mission. The response instead provides a repetitive and irrelevant prayer-like statement, which does not contribute to the discussion of myrrh or its symbolic meaning.\n\nAdditionally, while the response mentions myrrh as part of the gifts given to Jesus at His birth, it does not provide any meaningful insights into its significance or symbolism in the biblical context. The provided answer about myrrh representing Jesus' future suffering and death is a good starting point, but the response fails to build upon this insight or explore its implications.\n\nTo improve this response, the writer could focus on discussing the symbolic meaning of myrrh in relation to Jesus' mission and purpose, rather than providing repetitive prayers."
