Comment: The response lacks depth and coherence, failing to address the concern raised about understanding the symbolism of the gifts given to Jesus. It merely repeats a general statement about the significance of myrrh without expanding on how it enhances appreciation of Jesus' purpose and mission. More specific references to Biblical teachings and theological concepts would have strengthened the response.
