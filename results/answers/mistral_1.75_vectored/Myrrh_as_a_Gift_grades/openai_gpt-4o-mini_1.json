  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student's response lacks relevance and coherence to the concern provided. The original answer about myrrh's significance in symbolizing Jesus' future suffering and death is not effectively connected to the concern about understanding the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus. The excessive repetition in the response detracts from its quality and does not address the concern in a meaningful way."
