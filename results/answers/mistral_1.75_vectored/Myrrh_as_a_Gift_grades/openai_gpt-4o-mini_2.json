The excessive repetition of a portion of a prayer from the Gospel of Luke detracts from the coherence and relevance of the overall content. The response could have been enhanced by delving deeper into how myrrh symbolized Jesus' future suffering and death, connecting it more explicitly to his role as the Messiah and the significance of this representation in understanding his purpose and mission."
