  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComments: The response provides some correct points on Jesus being the image of God, particularly referencing Colossians and Ephesians. However, there are inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the explanation, such as mixing up references and attributing statements to Jesus that are not directly from Him. The understanding of Jesus as the image of God could be expanded upon with deeper theological insight and clarity. Focus on citing accurate biblical references and explaining their significance more cohesively. Improvements in scriptural accuracy and theological coherence would enhance the overall quality of the response."
