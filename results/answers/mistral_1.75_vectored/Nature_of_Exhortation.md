Christians are called to be a light and a blessing to others, and one way they can do this is through exhortation. The Bible teaches us how we should approach exhortation in several ways:

1. Prayer: Before we begin to exhort someone, we should pray for them. We should ask God to give us wisdom and guidance as we speak to them, and we should also pray for their spiritual growth and protection.

2. Love and kindness: Exhortation should always be done with love and kindness. We should treat everyone we exhort with respect and love, regardless of their background or circumstances.

3. Scripture: The Bible is our ultimate guide for all things, including exhortation. We should always base our exhortations on the teachings of the Bible and use scriptures to encourage and uplift those we are speaking to.

4. Encouragement: Our primary goal in exhorting others is to encourage them to live a holy life and grow in their faith. We should focus on the positive aspects of their life and encourage them to continue living in Christ.

5. Repentance: If there is sin involved in the situation, we should always encourage repentance and forgiveness. We should remind them of the love and forgiveness that Jesus has given us and encourage them to turn back to Him.

6. Prayerful response: We should always respond to exhortation with prayer. We should pray for the person who is exhorting us, asking for wisdom and guidance, and we should also pray for the person who is being exhorted, asking for their protection and spiritual growth.

In summary, Christians should approach exhortation with love, kindness, and prayer. They should base their exhortations on the teachings of the Bible and encourage the person they are speaking to to live a holy life and grow in their faith.
