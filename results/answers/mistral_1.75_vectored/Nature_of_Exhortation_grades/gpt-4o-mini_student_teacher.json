  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer on how Christians should approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament. They emphasized the importance of love, prayer, scripture, encouragement, repentance, and a prayerful response in the exhortation process. However, the reference answer from the teacher highlights the key point that exhortation should be done in love, which the student's answer also covers but in more detail. Therefore, while the student's response is thorough, they could have focused more on the central theme of exhortation in love to align closely with the teacher's reference answer."
