It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of spiritual engagement over physical rituals in connecting with God. The response also incorporates aspects of prayer, Bible reading, serving others, and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, aligning well with a Christian worldview. It is clear, well-structured, and offers practical advice for living out one's faith. Great job!"
