  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10/100\n\nComment: The response provided is repetitive and does not address the question about the nature and experience of hell as per the Bible. It solely focuses on the concept of heaven and the heavenly gift for the saved individuals. The answer lacks depth, relevance, and coherence to the question asked. Significant improvement is needed to address the biblical teachings about hell."
