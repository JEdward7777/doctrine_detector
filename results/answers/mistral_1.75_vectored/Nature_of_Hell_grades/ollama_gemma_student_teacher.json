  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 0/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the biblical teaching on hell. It fails to address the severity and purpose of hell as described in the reference answer. The repeated repetition of irrelevant statements about heaven and a heavenly gift does not constitute a meaningful response to the question about hell."
