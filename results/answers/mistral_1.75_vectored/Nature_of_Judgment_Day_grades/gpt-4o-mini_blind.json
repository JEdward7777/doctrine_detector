However, it would have been more accurate to refer to \"Judgment Day\" simply as the final day of judgment without associating specific subtitles like \"The Judgment Day of the Holy Spirit\" or \"The Judgment Day of the Lamb,\" as those are not commonly used terms in Christian doctrine. The answer could also have elaborated more on the concept of God's righteous judgment based on deeds, as mentioned in the Bible."
