  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of Judgment Day in a Christian context, mentioning the judgment, salvation, and importance of faith in Jesus Christ. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the evaluation of actions and beliefs by God as the basis for eternal consequences, as highlighted in the reference answer. Emphasizing the relationship between faith in Jesus and deeds in life would have strengthened the explanation of the significance of Judgment Day for personal faith."
