In the Christian Bible, "Judgment Day" is also known as "The Judgment Day of the Holy Spirit" or "The Judgment Day of the Lamb." It is a time of judgment and salvation for all people. According to the Bible, Jesus will come again to fulfill the promise of His Second Coming. On this day, He will judge those who have accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior and those who have not. Those who accept Jesus will be saved and receive eternal life, while those who do not will be judged according to their sins and will receive eternal punishment. This event is a reminder of the importance of repentance and faith in Jesus Christ.
