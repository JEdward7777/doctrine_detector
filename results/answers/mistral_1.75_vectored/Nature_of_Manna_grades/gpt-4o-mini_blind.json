  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComments: The response is incorrect as it misinterprets the Bible verses given. Manna is actually described in the book of Exodus as a bread-like substance that appeared miraculously and sustained the Israelites in the wilderness. The verses referenced (Matthew 26:42 and Acts 3:16) refer to Jesus' prayer in the garden of Gethsemane and Peter's preaching about the healing power of Jesus, not about the appearance and taste of manna. The student should study the Bible verses more carefully to provide a correct answer."
