The Bible describes manna as a "meek and humble spirit" (Matthew 26:42). It is also described as a "blest and holy Spirit" (Acts 3:16). In addition, the Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit is sent to guide and protect us in our Christian walk.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer does not accurately reflect the biblical description of manna. The answer provided lacks understanding of the miraculous provision of God, as it conflates manna with the Holy Spirit. The student should review the biblical account of manna in Exodus to gain a better understanding.
