The student missed the opportunity to integrate the significance of manna as a symbol of God's faithfulness and provision in the Old Testament, and how it ties into the spiritual nourishment and guidance provided by the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. A deeper exploration of the spiritual implications of manna would have been beneficial in providing a more holistic Christian worldview perspective."
