  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a good understanding of how Jesus's miracles demonstrate His divine nature and mission to bring salvation and hope. However, the student falls short in explicitly stating that the miracles reveal Jesus as God and the Messiah. Encouragement to strengthen the linkage of Jesus's miracles to His identity as the Son of God would improve the grade."
