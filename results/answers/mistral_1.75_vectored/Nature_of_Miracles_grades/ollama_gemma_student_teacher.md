**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies key aspects of Jesus's miracles as evidence of His divine nature and mission. It clearly explains that the miracles reveal Jesus's love, compassion, and power to heal and restore life. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern about affirming Jesus's divine nature. Additionally, the answer does not elaborate on the significance of the miracles in understanding Jesus as the Christ or the Messiah, as suggested in the reference answer.
