  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a generally accurate understanding of the relationship between scripture and the Word of God in the biblical context. However, there is a lack of clarity in distinguishing between the term 'scripture' as specifically referring to the Old and New Testament books of the Bible and the concept of the 'Word of God' encompassing not only written scriptures but also other messages from God, including those delivered by Jesus. The student should have emphasized the broader understanding of the 'Word of God' beyond just the Bible to align with the Christian worldview."
