  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer clearly explains the relationship between scripture and the Word of God in the biblical context. It correctly identifies the Old and New Testaments as scripture and emphasizes their significance as sacred texts. The student also acknowledges the importance of scripture as a guide for Christians and explains the connection between scripture and the teachings of Jesus Christ. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit explanation of the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word, as per the concern raised."
