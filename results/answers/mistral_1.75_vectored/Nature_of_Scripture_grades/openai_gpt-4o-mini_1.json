It also effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word, stating that the 'word of God' can encompass both written messages (Hebrew scriptures) and other messages from God, such as those delivered by Jesus. The response could have further emphasized the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate Word of God bridging written scripture and God's spoken word for a more comprehensive understanding."
