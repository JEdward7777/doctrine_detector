  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student accurately identifies the role of our sinful nature in temptation using a biblical reference from Ephesians. However, the student's explanation of external influences is a bit confusing and does not directly address their role in temptation as clearly as it could. The student also seems to mix up different teachings of Jesus in the Bible, which can be misleading. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic but room for improvement in clarity and accuracy of biblical references."
