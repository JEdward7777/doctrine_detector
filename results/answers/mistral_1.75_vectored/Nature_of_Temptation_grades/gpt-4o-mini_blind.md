## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Our sinful nature plays a significant role in temptation. It is stated that "our sinful nature desires to make us want to do what is wrong" (Ephesians 2:7). This desire can lead us to be tempted to do things that are not pleasing to God.

External influences also play a role in temptation. The Bible teaches us to be careful of the people we surround ourselves with, as they can influence us to do what is right or wrong. For example, Jesus said, "Let us love one another, just as Christ loved me. And whoever loves has been given a command to love, that we should love one another, just as Christ loves His Christian brothers and His holy commands. I am fulfilling this command.

If you have any other question please let me know.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student accurately identifies the role of our sinful nature in temptation using a biblical reference from Ephesians. However, the student's explanation of external influences is a bit confusing and does not directly address their role in temptation as clearly as it could. The student also seems to mix up different teachings of Jesus in the Bible, which can be misleading. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic but room for improvement in clarity and accuracy of biblical references.
