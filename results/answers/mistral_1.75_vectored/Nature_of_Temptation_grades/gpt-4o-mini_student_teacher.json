  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: \nWhile the student correctly mentioned the role of sinful nature in temptation, their answer became somewhat unclear and mixed with unrelated passages. They did not explicitly mention external influences such as Satan in the context of temptation, which is an important aspect according to Christian teaching. The response lacks clarity and coherence in addressing the full spectrum of sources of temptation as outlined in the reference answer."
