  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Clearly explains the role of our sinful nature in driving the desire for what is wrong, referencing Ephesians 2:7.\n* Acknowledges the influence of external factors, citing Jesus' words about loving others.\n* Provides a specific example from Scripture (Jesus' command to love others) to support the claim about external influence.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The connection between external influences and Satan is not explicitly mentioned.\n* The response lacks additional examples or elaboration on how external factors can entice to sin.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could strengthen their response by elaborating on how Satan might utilize external influences to tempt individuals.\n* Providing additional examples of how external pressures or people can influence temptation would enhance the response's comprehensiveness.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on temptation. However, incorporating the mentioned improvements would elevate the quality of the response to an even higher level."
