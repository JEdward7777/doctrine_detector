## Stated Concern
This question reflects on the understanding of the sources and reasons for temptation in Christian teaching.

## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Our sinful nature plays a significant role in temptation. It is stated that "our sinful nature desires to make us want to do what is wrong" (Ephesians 2:7). This desire can lead us to be tempted to do things that are not pleasing to God.

External influences also play a role in temptation. The Bible teaches us to be careful of the people we surround ourselves with, as they can influence us to do what is right or wrong. For example, Jesus said, "Let us love one another, just as Christ loved me. And whoever loves has been given a command to love, that we should love one another, just as Christ loves His Christian brothers and His holy commands. I am fulfilling this command.

If you have any other question please let me know.
