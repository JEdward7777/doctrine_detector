  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: The response provides a general overview of how the Bible suggests individuals can be wicked through sinful actions and mentions the need for repentance and turning back to God. However, the answer lacks depth and coherence. The repetition of the same points multiple times without providing new insights or expanding on theological implications detracts from the overall quality of the response. Additionally, there are several instances of incoherent repetition that weaken the structure and clarity of the answer. Greater focus on specific biblical examples of wicked behaviors and their consequences, along with a more organized presentation, would have improved the grade."
