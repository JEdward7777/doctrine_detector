## [Answer](../Nature_of_Wickedness.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that individuals can be wicked in their actions by committing sins. These sins include acts of love and obedience to God, as well as acts of disobedience to God. For example, the Bible teaches that Jesus came to fulfill the commandments of the Old Testament, including the Ten Commandments, which are a summary of God's love for His people. In Matthew 7:12, Jesus says, "And I will give you a new commandment: that you love one another, just as I have loved you." This is a commandment to love others as Jesus loves us.

However, the Bible also teaches that individuals can be wicked by committing sinful acts. For example, the Bible teaches that Jesus came to save us from our sins (Matthew 26:39). He also taught us to pray for forgiveness and to ask for help to overcome sin (Matthew 7:7).

The Bible also teaches that individuals who are wicked will receive eternal punishment. For example, the Bible teaches that Jesus came to fulfill the prophets and the Old Testament, including the prophecy of Isaiah, which speaks of Jesus' mission to save those who are sick and to heal those who are broken (Isaiah 53:4-5). Jesus also teaches us to forgive those who have wronged us and to pray for those who persecute us (Matthew 7:7-12).

In addition to these teachings, the Bible also teaches that individuals who are wicked should repent and turn back to God. For example, the Bible teaches that Jesus came to fulfill the prophets and the Old Testament, including the prophecy of Isaiah, which speaks of Jesus' mission to save those who are sick and to heal those who are broken (Isaiah 53:4-5).
