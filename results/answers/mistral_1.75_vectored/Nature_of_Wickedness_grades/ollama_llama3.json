  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant biblical references and teachings, but it largely reiterates the same points multiple times without much depth or insight. The concern about exploring how biblical perspectives on wickedness can influence moral behavior and spiritual growth is not fully addressed, as the response mainly focuses on summarizing biblical passages rather than providing meaningful connections between these teachings and everyday life.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more nuanced explanations of the biblical concepts and their practical applications in Christian living."
