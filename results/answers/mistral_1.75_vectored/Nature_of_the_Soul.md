## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible uses both "soul" and "spirit" to refer to the spiritual part of a person, but there are some differences in how they are used.

The Bible teaches that every person has a soul, which is considered the most important part of a person. The soul is described as being made up of three parts: the body, the mind, and the spirit. The body and the mind are physical and spiritual gifts given to us by God, while the spirit is the most important part of our soul.

The spirit is also referred to as the Holy Spirit, and it is considered a gift from God. It is the part of the soul that is closest to God and is filled with the love and peace of Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit is also called upon to guide and protect us, to help us make decisions, and to give us strength and courage.

In addition to the Holy Spirit, the Bible also talks about the Holy Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is sent to guide and protect us. This Holy Spirit is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and it is considered a gift from God.

So, while the Bible uses both "soul" and "spirit" to refer to the spiritual part of a person, the Holy Spirit is specifically referred to as the Holy Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, and it is considered a gift from God that is meant to guide and protect us.
