  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student's answer contains some inaccuracies and theological errors. The concept of the soul being made up of the body, mind, and spirit is not a biblical teaching. The Holy Spirit is not synonymous with the spirit of a person; they are distinct entities. Additionally, the statement that the Holy Spirit is also referred to as the Holy Spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ is misleading. The Holy Spirit is one of the three persons of the Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The explanation lacks clarity and scriptural support for key points. Improvement is needed in scriptural accuracy and depth of understanding."
