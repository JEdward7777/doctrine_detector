  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer is inaccurate and contains incorrect theological interpretations regarding the concepts of 'soul' and 'spirit' in a Christian worldview. The answer confuses the roles and identities of the soul, spirit, and the Holy Spirit, leading to a misrepresentation of biblical teachings. The understanding of these concepts is essential for accurate interpretation of scripture and relationship with God. Further study and clarification are recommended."
