However, there is confusion in the explanation and a lack of clarity on the distinctiveness of these terms according to biblical definitions. The response could benefit from a more thorough examination of the biblical texts and a clearer articulation of the relationship between the soul, spirit, and the Holy Spirit, as well as their roles in human nature and relationship with God from a Christian worldview."
