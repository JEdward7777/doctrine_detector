However, it lacks clarity and coherence in articulating the distinct nature of the soul and spirit as presented in the Bible. The explanation could be strengthened by providing more direct references to specific biblical passages that differentiate between the soul and spirit. Additionally, a more in-depth exploration of the theological significance of these concepts in the Christian worldview would improve the response's adherence to accurate interpretation of scripture."
