  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student a grade of 50.\n\nWhile the student has listed several restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow, their answer is largely inaccurate and includes some misinformation. The listed restrictions are not entirely accurate and do not align with the biblical description of the Nazirite vow in Numbers 6:1-4. The key restrictions mentioned by the student are different from the ones outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher.\n\nTo improve their grade, the student should focus on accurately representing the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in the biblical context. This would require a better understanding of the specific requirements outlined in Numbers 6:1-4."
