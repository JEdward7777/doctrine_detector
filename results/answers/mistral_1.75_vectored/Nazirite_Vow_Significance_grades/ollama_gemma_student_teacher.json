  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies several of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. However, the answer lacks nuance and does not capture the full breadth and depth of the vow's requirements. The reference answer provided by the teacher includes additional restrictions that are not mentioned in the student's response, such as abstaining from cutting one's hair and not going near a dead body. Overall, the student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the basic restrictions of the Nazirite vow but could benefit from greater depth and comprehensiveness."
