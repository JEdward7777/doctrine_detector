## [Answer](../New_Covenant_Significance.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The New Covenant established through Jesus is significant because it represents a deeper and more intimate relationship between God and his people. It is a promise to renew and fulfill the Old Covenant, and to provide a way for people to be forgiven and saved through Jesus Christ. This new covenant also includes a promise to help us live a holy life and to guide us in our Christian walk. It is a reminder that we are now part of the Holy Church and are called to serve and love others as Jesus loves us.
