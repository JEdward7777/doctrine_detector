The New Covenant established through Jesus is significant because it represents a deeper and more intimate relationship between God and his people. It is a promise to renew and fulfill the Old Covenant, and to provide a way for people to be forgiven and saved through Jesus Christ. This new covenant also includes a promise to help us live a holy life and to guide us in our Christian walk.
