  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25\n\nComment: The student's response contains several inaccuracies and does not provide a clear understanding of the instruction regarding Psalms in the New Testament. The content of the response is mostly a repetition of the same text without relevance to the question asked. Additionally, there are misattributions of verses and teachings to Jesus that are not specifically related to the Psalms. The answer lacks depth and does not demonstrate a solid understanding of the relationship between the Psalms and the New Testament teachings. More clarity and accuracy are needed in connecting the Psalms to Christian beliefs and practices taught in the New Testament."
