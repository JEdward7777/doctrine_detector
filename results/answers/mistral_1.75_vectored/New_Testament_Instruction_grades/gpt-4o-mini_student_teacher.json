  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The student's answer goes off track and does not directly address the concern of how biblical teachings regarding Psalms apply to contemporary Christian worship. The response includes irrelevant text that does not provide a clear understanding of the instruction Christians receive regarding Psalms in the New Testament. To improve the grade, the student should focus on connecting the significance of Psalms in worship practices for Christians based on biblical teachings."
