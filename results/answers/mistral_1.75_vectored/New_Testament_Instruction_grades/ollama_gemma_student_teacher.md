The Bible teaches that the Psalms are a part of the Old Testament and were meant to be fulfilled in Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, Jesus often quotes and references the Psalms, showing their importance in fulfilling the prophets' teachings.

In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says: "I will always be with you, and I will give you a commandment to love one another, just as I have loved you. And I will give you a new commandment: that whoever loves me will also love me and fulfill the commandments I have given you. This is my commandment: that you love one another, just as I have loved you.

And if anyone has a servant who loves me, he will be blessed and fulfilled. I will be with you always.
