  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided does not adequately address the concern of how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship. The content of the response is mostly repetitive phrases and does not offer any meaningful insight into the application of singing psalms in modern Christian worship practices. The excessive repetition of the phrase \"I will pray for you\" detracts from the overall coherence and relevance of the response. More focused and relevant content addressing the concern would have resulted in a higher grade."
