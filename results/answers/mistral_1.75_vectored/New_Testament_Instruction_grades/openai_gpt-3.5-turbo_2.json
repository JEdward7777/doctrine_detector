  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response does not effectively address the concern of how biblical teachings, specifically the instruction to sing psalms to God in the New Testament, apply to contemporary Christian worship. The extensive repetition at the end detracts from the overall coherence and relevance to the concern presented. Further development and clarity on connecting the importance and practice of singing psalms in contemporary Christian worship would significantly improve the grade."
