  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided does not effectively address the concern of how biblical teachings, specifically the Psalms, apply to contemporary Christian worship. It goes off on a tangent with repetitive prayers attributed to Jesus and lacks a clear connection to the New Testament instruction of singing psalms as a form of worship. More focused and relevant discussion linking the usage of Psalms in worship today would improve the grade."
