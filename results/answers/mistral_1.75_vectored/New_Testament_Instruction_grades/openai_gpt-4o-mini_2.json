The extensive repetition towards the end of the response is not relevant to the question on how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship. The focus should have been on explaining how singing Psalms in worship is a biblical practice that carries meaning and significance for Christians today. Additionally, the content of the repeated prayer does not directly address the concern given. A more focused and relevant explanation linking biblical teachings on singing Psalms to contemporary Christian worship would have been more appropriate."
