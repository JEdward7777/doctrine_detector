## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the New Testament, every believer in Jesus is considered a priest. This is because Jesus is referred to as the "Holy Lamb" and the "Savior of the sheep," and He is also called the "Christ the Savior." The Bible teaches that Jesus came to save us from our sins and to make us holy.

In the Old Testament, the priests were responsible for offering sacrifices to God and serving as a mediator between God and His people. Jesus fulfilled this role by becoming the ultimate sacrifice for all Christians. He died on the cross to pay the price for our sins and to make us holy.

As a result, every believer in Jesus is considered a priest in the New Testament. We are called to serve as Christ's servants and to offer ourselves to Him as a living sacrifice. We are also called to pray for one another and to share the love of Jesus with others.

This is a wonderful blessing for all believers, as we are called to be a part of the Holy Church and to serve as a witness to the love and grace of Jesus.
