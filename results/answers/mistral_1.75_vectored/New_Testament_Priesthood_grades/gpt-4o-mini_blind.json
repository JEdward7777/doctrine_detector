However, the response lacked depth and missed key doctrinal points such as the priesthood of all believers as highlighted in 1 Peter 2:9, and the role of believers as mediators between God and the world. Additionally, the explanation could have been more detailed and supported by specific biblical references to strengthen the theological foundation of the argument. Overall, while the answer touched on some important aspects, it needed more theological clarity and depth."
