  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a generally solid understanding of the concept of the priesthood of all believers, highlighting Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice and mediator between God and His people. However, the response could be improved by focusing more specifically on the direct access to God in prayer that believers have as priests, as emphasized in the reference answer. Additionally, the student could have elaborated more on the implications and significance of believers serving as priests in the New Testament."
