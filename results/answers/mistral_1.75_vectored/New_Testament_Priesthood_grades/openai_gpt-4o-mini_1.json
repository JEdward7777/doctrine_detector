It correctly highlights the role of every believer in Jesus as being able to come directly to God in prayer to intercede for themselves and others, reflecting the priesthood of all believers as taught in the New Testament. The response effectively explains how Jesus fulfilled the role of a mediator and ultimate sacrifice, allowing all believers to approach God individually. There is a clear connection between the answer provided and the concern raised regarding the priesthood of all believers. Great job!"
