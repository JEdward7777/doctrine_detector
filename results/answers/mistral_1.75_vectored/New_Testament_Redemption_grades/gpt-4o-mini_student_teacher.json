They correctly recognize Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of purification and highlight the shift from rituals and sacrifices to the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more explicitly on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, as specified in the concern."
