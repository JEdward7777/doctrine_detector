## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Old Testament, purification is seen as a way to cleanse oneself from sin and to be closer to God. This is done through various rituals and sacrifices, such as the Day of Atonement and the Lamb's blood sacrifice. The purpose of these acts was to forgive sins and to make the person who participated in them holy and righteous.

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is the ultimate source of purification and salvation. He came to fulfill the Old Testament sacrificial law and to offer His life as a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus offers eternal salvation and purification to all who believe in Him.

In the New Testament, the focus on purification is not just about following specific rituals or commands, but it is also about living a life that reflects the love and teachings of Jesus Christ. This includes loving one another, serving others, and being a witness to the love of Jesus to those around us.

In addition, the Holy Spirit is also a key part of the Christian's spiritual growth and purification. The Holy Spirit helps believers to live a holy life and to grow in their faith and love for Jesus Christ.

Overall, while the concept of purification is important in both the Old and New Testaments, the focus and means of purification are different. In the Old Testament, it is done through rituals and sacrifices, while in the New Testament, it is done through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.
