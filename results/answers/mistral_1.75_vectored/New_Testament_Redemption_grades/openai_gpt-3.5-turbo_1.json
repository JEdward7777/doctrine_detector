  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately recognizes the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate means of eternal purification from sin, in line with Christian doctrine. The discussion on how purification is achieved through repentance, trust in Jesus, and His sacrifice aligns well with the concern provided. Additionally, the response effectively contrasts the Old Testament rituals with the New Testament focus on Jesus Christ and living a life reflective of His teachings. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more direct references to relevant biblical passages to support the points made."
