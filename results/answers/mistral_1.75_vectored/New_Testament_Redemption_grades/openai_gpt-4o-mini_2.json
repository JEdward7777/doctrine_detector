It appropriately emphasizes the importance of repentance, trust in Jesus, and His ultimate sacrifice in providing permanent cleansing from sin, thereby addressing the concern raised. The explanation is clear, accurate, and reflective of key Christian beliefs regarding purification in the New Testament. Well done!"
