  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not effectively address the concern of connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to understand biblical continuity. The references provided by the student are not relevant to the question asked about John the Baptist being a Nazirite. The student's response does not align with a Christian worldview in connecting the specific evidence from the New Testament to suggest John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite. The student should focus on providing accurate and relevant biblical references to support their argument."
