  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides verses from the New Testament to suggest that Jesus may have followed the Nazarite vow, but it does not directly address the concern of connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures to understand biblical continuity. The answer lacks clear explanation or analysis in this regard. Additionally, some of the verses provided in the response are not directly related to the Nazarite vow."
