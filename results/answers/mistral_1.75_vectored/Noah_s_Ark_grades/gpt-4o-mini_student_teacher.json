  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 90. \n\nThe student accurately identifies that the purpose of Noah's Ark was to save Noah and his family from the flood as commanded by God. They also mention the symbolic significance of the ark in terms of salvation, faith, and obedience. \n\nWhile the student's answer aligns with Christian teachings on obedience and faith, they could have emphasized more explicitly the aspect of God's judgment on humanity, which is a fundamental part of understanding the narrative of Noah's Ark in the context of God's plan for salvation and preservation."
