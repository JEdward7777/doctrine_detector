**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the primary purpose of Noah's Ark as fulfilling God's commandment. However, it lacks elaboration on the broader context of God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative. The reference answer provides a more comprehensive explanation by emphasizing the aspect of judgment and preservation during the flood.
