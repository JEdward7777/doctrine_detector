## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Listening to God is a central part of becoming wise. The Bible teaches us that we should listen and obey Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate example of love and wisdom. In Matthew 6:33, it says "But above all these I want you to have the greatest love for the Holy Spirit, which will help me make you holy and enable me to give you a prayer that will bring peace to anyone who is involved in any way.

In addition to listening to Jesus, we are also called to listen to the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is sent to guide and protect us, and to help us grow in holiness. In Acts 5:46-47, it says "Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47. Acts 5:46-47.
