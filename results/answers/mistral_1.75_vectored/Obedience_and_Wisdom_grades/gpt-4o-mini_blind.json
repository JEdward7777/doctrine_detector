  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45/100\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant points about the importance of listening to God, particularly through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. However, the answer lacks coherence and clarity. Additionally, the Bible references provided are inaccurate or incomplete, which detracts from the credibility of the response. The student's answer would benefit from a more organized structure, accurate biblical citations, and a clearer explanation of how listening to God leads to wisdom."
