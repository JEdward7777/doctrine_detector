  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response effectively emphasizes the importance of listening to God, specifically through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. However, the lengthy and repetitive citations detract from the clarity and cohesiveness of the answer. It would have been better if the student had focused on explaining the connection between listening to God and gaining wisdom in a more concise and organized manner. Overall, the student demonstrates an understanding of the concept but could have communicated it more effectively."
