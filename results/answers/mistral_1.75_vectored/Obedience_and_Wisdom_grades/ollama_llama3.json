  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 40.\n\nWhile the response mentions listening to God and obeying His will, which is a key aspect of becoming wise, it does not directly address the concern about recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom. The response also lacks clarity and specificity, as it repeats the same verse multiple times without providing any additional insights or applications.\n\nAdditionally, the response seems to be more focused on summarizing Bible verses rather than applying biblical principles to everyday life. This lack of practical application and connection to the concern makes it difficult for me to award a higher score.\n\nOverall, while the response does touch on some important themes related to wisdom and obedience, it falls short in providing a clear and concise connection between these concepts and the specified concern."
