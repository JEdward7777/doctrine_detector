  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response does mention the importance of listening to God and obeying His will in order to become wise, which aligns with the given answer and concern. However, the excessive repetition of Acts 5:46-47 at the end detracts from the overall coherence and effectiveness of the response. It would have been more impactful to provide additional relevant Bible verses or explanations instead of repeating the same passage multiple times."
