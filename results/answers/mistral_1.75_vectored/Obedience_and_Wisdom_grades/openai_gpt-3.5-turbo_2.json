  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response acknowledges the importance of listening to God and obeying His will for wisdom, it fails to directly address the concern of recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom as a key factor in enhancing one's spiritual journey. The lengthy and repetitive Bible verses provided in the response do not effectively support the main point and instead detract from the clarity and coherence of the message. The response could be improved by more directly addressing the concern and providing concise, relevant scriptural support."
