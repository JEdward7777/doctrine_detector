  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response addresses the concern raised about recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom, but it fails to effectively convey how this understanding enhances one's spiritual journey. The bulk of the response consists of Bible verses without much explanation or elaboration on the importance of listening to God and the Holy Spirit. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses is commendable, but the lack of coherent explanation or analysis limits the depth of the response. Fleshing out the explanation and providing more insights would strengthen the overall argument."
