  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20/100\n\nComment: The student's response does not accurately address the question about actions categorized as folly in the Bible. Instead, the student lists verses about love and serving others, which though important teachings in the Bible, are not directly related to actions categorized as folly. The student needs to provide verses or examples of actions that the Bible explicitly categorizes as foolish in order to receive a higher grade."
