However, the verses provided do not directly address the contrast between wisdom and foolishness. Nonetheless, the attempt to draw connections to love and serving others aligns with the concern of recognizing folly to make better decisions in alignment with God's will. The response could be enhanced by including specific verses or examples that illustrate actions considered foolish and wise in a clearer manner."
