However, there is a significant discrepancy between the provided answer and the verses listed, as the verses mainly focus on the importance of love and following God's commands rather than specifically addressing folly. Connecting the verses more directly to the concept of recognizing folly in one's actions and encouraging better decision-making aligned with God's will would strengthen the response."
