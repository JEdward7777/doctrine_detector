3. Galatians 5:7 says, "Let us love one another, for love comes from the Holy Spirit.

4. Colossians 3:10 says, "And whatever you do, in word or deed, let it be done in love.

5. Ephesians 4:32 says, "And let us love one another, just as Christ loved me.

6. John 13:34 says, "Love one another, just as I have loved you.

7. Matthew 7:7 says, "And if anyone loves me, he will come to me and I will give him a blessing.

8. Matthew 7:14 says, "And whoever loves me will come to me and I will give him a blessing.

9. Matthew 7:17 says, "And whoever loves me will come to me and I will give him a blessing.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response correctly identifies actions described as folly as those that are against God's will. However, there is a significant discrepancy between the provided answer and the verses listed, as the verses mainly focus on the importance of love and following God's commands rather than specifically addressing folly. Connecting the verses more directly to the concept of recognizing folly in one's actions and encouraging better decision-making aligned with God's will would strengthen the response.
