The mention of offering sacrifices as a central part of the Christian faith is not entirely accurate in the context of the Old Testament. It would be more precise to describe sacrifices as a way of atonement for sins in the Jewish faith of the Old Testament rather than specifically referring to the Christian faith. Additionally, the statement about teaching the people about the teachings of Jesus Christ may be confusing as Jesus Christ had not yet been born during the Old Testament period. The answer would benefit from greater specificity and a clearer focus on the practices and rituals of the Old Testament priesthood."
