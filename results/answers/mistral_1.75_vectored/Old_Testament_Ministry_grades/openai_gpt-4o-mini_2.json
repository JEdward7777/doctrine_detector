  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a good overview of the roles and duties of priests in the Old Testament, focusing on offering sacrifices, taking care of the temple, and praying on behalf of the people. It effectively connects these practices to current ministry approaches and sacrificial service understanding, demonstrating an understanding of the potential relevance of Old Testament practices to modern ministry. The response could have further elaborated on specific examples or practical applications, but overall it effectively addressed the concern raised."
