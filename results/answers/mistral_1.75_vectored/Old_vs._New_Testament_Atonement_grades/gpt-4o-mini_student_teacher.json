  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a good explanation of the differences between atonement in the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the significance of sacrifices in the Old Testament and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus in the New Testament. The student could have further emphasized the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history to align more closely with the specific concern mentioned."
