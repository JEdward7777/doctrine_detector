The writer also mentions the importance of prayer and repentance in the New Testament, which is relevant to the concern about clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more detail and depth on this topic. For example, it would have been helpful to explore the concept of covenantal atonement in the Old Testament, and how Jesus' sacrifice fulfilled those covenants and brought about a new era of relationship with God. Additionally, while the writer mentions that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for all sins forever, they could have elaborated on what this means for our understanding of salvation and sanctification.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good overview of the different approaches to atonement in the Old and New Testaments, but could benefit from more nuance and explanation."
