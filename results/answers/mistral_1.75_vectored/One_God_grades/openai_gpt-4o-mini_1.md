When translating the Bible for cultures that respect multiple deities, it is important to emphasize the unity and love of God. This can be done by using phrases such as "God loves you" or "Jesus loves you." Additionally, it may be helpful to use language that emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and love in the Bible, as these are central themes in Christianity.
