It accurately connects the festival to the giving of the Law to the Israelites through Moses. However, the response could have further emphasized the connection between the Festival of Weeks and its fulfillment in Christ, highlighting how the festival foreshadowed the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost in the New Testament. Strengthening this link would have enhanced the Christian worldview perspective on the festival."
