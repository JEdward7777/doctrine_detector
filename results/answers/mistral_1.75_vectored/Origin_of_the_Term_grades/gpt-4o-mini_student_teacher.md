## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The earliest Christians were first called "Christians" in the Holy Bible, specifically in the Acts of the Apostles. In Acts 2:47, it says "And they went to the early Christians and said, ‘Acts of love and prayers and the Lord’s prayer and the Lord’s commands and the Lord’s teachings.” This is a reference to the early Christian church in Jerusalem who were following the teachings of Jesus Christ.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer correctly identifies that Christians were first mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, which is commendable. However, the specific location where Jesus' followers were first called Christians was in Antioch, not Jerusalem as mentioned in the student's response. This historical inaccuracy impacts the accuracy of the answer. Further understanding and clarity on the historical context of the term "Christian" is needed for a higher grade.
