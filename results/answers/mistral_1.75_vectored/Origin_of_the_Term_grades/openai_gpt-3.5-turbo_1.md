## [Answer](../Origin_of_the_Term.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The earliest Christians were first called "Christians" in the Holy Bible, specifically in the Acts of the Apostles. In Acts 2:47, it says "And they went to the early Christians and said, ‘Acts of love and prayers and the Lord’s prayer and the Lord’s commands and the Lord’s teachings.” This is a reference to the early Christian church in Jerusalem who were following the teachings of Jesus Christ.
