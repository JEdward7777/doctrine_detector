  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The answer provided is partially correct. The term \"Christian\" was indeed first used in the city of Antioch (Acts 11:26), not in Jerusalem as incorrectly stated in the response being assessed. While the student accurately identified the city where the term originated, they did not fully address the concern of recognizing the historical context and significance of the term \"Christian.\" Therefore, the grade is moderate as the answer is only partially correct and lacks depth in addressing the specified concern."
