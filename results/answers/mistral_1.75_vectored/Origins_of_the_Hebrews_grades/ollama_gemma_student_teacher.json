  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nWhile the student's answer is generally accurate and provides a concise explanation of the Hebrews' ancestry as descendants of the Israelites, it lacks specific reference to the biblical lineage traced through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as specified in the reference answer. Including this additional information would strengthen the student's understanding of the Biblical narrative and demonstrate a deeper engagement with the concern stated."
