Comment: The response correctly identifies the Hebrews as descendants of Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob, which is in line with biblical genealogy. However, the original response does not provide this specific information and instead offers a broader explanation. While the broader context provided is informative, understanding the direct lineage is essential for grasping Biblical narratives as it connects the Hebrew people to their biblical roots more clearly.
