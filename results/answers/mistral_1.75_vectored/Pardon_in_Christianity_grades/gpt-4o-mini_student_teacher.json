  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good explanation of how the concept of pardon relates to God's forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ. They correctly highlighted the idea of forgiveness and reconciliation through Jesus's sacrifice. However, there is room for improvement in directly addressing the concern of exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness. The student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of pardon in relation to divine forgiveness to earn a higher grade."
