  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 65. While the student correctly mentions the importance of Jesus' sacrifice and His role in fulfilling the promises of the Old Testament, there are some inaccuracies in the answer. \n\nFirstly, Passover is not a Christian holiday but rather a Jewish holiday that holds significance for Christians because of its connection to Jesus Christ. Secondly, the term \"Holy Week\" is traditionally used to refer to the week leading up to Easter, not specifically to Passover. \n\nOverall, the response shows some understanding of the connection between Passover and Jesus for Christians but lacks clarity and precision in its explanation."
