Comment: The student's answer correctly mentions the importance of Jesus' sacrifice in connection to Passover and acknowledges its significance for Christians. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the specific comparison between Jesus as the Passover Lamb in relation to the Old Testament practice of Passover. A more explicit explanation of how Jesus fulfills the Old Testament promises and parallels the Passover lamb would have strengthened the response.
