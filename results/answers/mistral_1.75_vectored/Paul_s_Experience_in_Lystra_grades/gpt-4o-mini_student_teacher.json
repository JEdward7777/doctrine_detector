  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer highlighting important lessons from Paul's stoning in Lystra related to faith and ministry perseverance. They effectively connected the story to themes of Jesus' presence, persecution, service, forgiveness, and prayer. The student's response exhibited a good understanding and application of Christian principles to encourage perseverance and faith in difficult circumstances. However, the response could be improved by focusing more on the central theme of perseverance and emphasizing the role of God's power in sustaining His servants through challenges."
