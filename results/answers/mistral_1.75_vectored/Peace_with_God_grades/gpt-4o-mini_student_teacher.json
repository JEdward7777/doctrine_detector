  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response contains a good amount of relevant Bible verses and explanations, showing a strong understanding of the significance of Jesus' sacrifice. However, there is a lack of focus on the importance of faith specifically in achieving peace with God, which is the main concern of the question. The student could improve by directly addressing the role of faith in accepting Jesus' forgiveness for sin and reconciling with God."
