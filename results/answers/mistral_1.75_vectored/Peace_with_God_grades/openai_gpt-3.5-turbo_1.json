However, the response mainly focuses on the aspect of forgiveness through faith without delving deeply into how faith impacts the Christian life beyond reconciliation. More incorporation of the transformative power of faith in shaping a Christian's daily walk and relationship with God would have enhanced the response further in addressing the concern."
