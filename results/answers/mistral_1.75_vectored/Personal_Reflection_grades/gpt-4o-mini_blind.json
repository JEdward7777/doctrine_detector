Firstly, the phrase \"Woe is me\" is not a biblical commandment but rather a common expression of distress or lament found in various contexts throughout literature, including the Bible. Additionally, the reference to Matthew 26:39 is incorrect as that verse actually depicts Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, expressing his distress before his impending crucifixion, rather than delivering a message about the importance of humility and repentance. The answer would benefit from a deeper understanding of the biblical context and interpretation of key verses."
