  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student correctly mentions humility, repentance, and seeking forgiveness through Jesus Christ, their answer does not directly address the specific concern of recognizing severe suffering or consequences of one's sins. Encouraging personal reflection on sin is not adequately emphasized in the student's response."
