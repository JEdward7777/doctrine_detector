The phrase "Woe is me" is a biblical commandment that is meant to be a reminder of the importance of humility and repentance. It is a call to recognize one's own sinfulness and to seek forgiveness through Jesus Christ. This verse is found in Matthew 26:39, where Jesus says, "And I will be with you, always." This verse is meant to be a comforting message for those who are struggling with their sins and seeking guidance from God.

**Grade:** 80

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies the biblical origin and meaning of the expression "Woe is me." However, it could benefit from further elaboration on the connection between the expression and personal reflection on spiritual state and awareness of sin. The response lacks a direct elaboration on how the expression expresses sorrow and recognition of severe suffering or the consequences of one's sins.
