  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does touch on the idea of recognizing one's own sinfulness, it seems to be more focused on the literal meaning of \"Woe is me\" rather than encouraging personal reflection on one's own spiritual state and awareness of sin. The response also includes an incorrect interpretation of Matthew 26:39, which actually says \"And he went away and prayed, saying 'Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.'\" (Matthew 26:39, NIV).\n\nTo better align with the concern of encouraging personal reflection on one's own spiritual state and awareness of sin, the response could have explored more deeply how \"Woe is me\" can serve as a reminder to examine our own hearts and seek forgiveness through Jesus Christ."
