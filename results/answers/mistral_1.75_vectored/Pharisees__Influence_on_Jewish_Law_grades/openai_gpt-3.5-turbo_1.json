The student effectively discusses the Pharisees' focus on the letter of the law rather than its spirit, which aligns well with the Christian worldview. The response could have delved deeper into specific examples of conflicts between Jesus and the Pharisees, as well as how these interactions shaped Jesus' ministry. This additional detail would have further enriched the analysis within a Christian worldview."
