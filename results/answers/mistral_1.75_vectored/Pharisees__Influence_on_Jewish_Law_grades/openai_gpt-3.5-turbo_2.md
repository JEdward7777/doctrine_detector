## [Answer](../Pharisees__Influence_on_Jewish_Law.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Pharisees were a Jewish Christian group who were deeply devoted to the teachings of the Old Testament. They believed that the Bible was the ultimate source of guidance for Christians, and they sought to live according to its teachings. However, their strict adherence to the Laws of Moses also made them very different from Jesus and his followers.

Jesus often taught about love and forgiveness, and he emphasized the importance of loving one's neighbor as well as loving God. He also taught about the importance of humility and serving others. These teachings were not consistent with the Pharisees' teachings, which emphasized following the law and fulfilling the commandments.

The Pharisees saw Jesus as a threat to their teachings and tried to persecute him. They accused him of being a false teacher and a sinner, and they even tried to arrest him. Jesus responded by teaching his followers to love and serve others, and to forgive those who wronged them.

Early Christians also saw the Pharisees as a threat to their faith. They saw the Pharisees as hypocrites who were more concerned with following the law than with loving God and serving others. They also saw the Pharisees as a reminder of the importance of following the teachings of Jesus and living according to the teachings of the Bible.

In summary, the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Laws of Moses had a significant impact on their relationship with Jesus and early Christians. While the Pharisees were deeply devoted to the teachings of the Old Testament, their teachings were not consistent with the teachings of Jesus. This led to conflict between the Pharisees and Jesus, and it also led to the early Christians seeing the Pharisees as a reminder of the importance of following the teachings of Jesus and loving God and serving others.
