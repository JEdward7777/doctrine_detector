The response effectively addresses the concern by explaining how the Pharisees' behavior presented challenges to Jesus in his ministry. The use of Christian teachings on love, forgiveness, humility, and serving others to contrast with the Pharisees' approach is appropriate and aligns well with a Christian worldview. The language is clear and the explanation is concise, contributing to a strong overall response."
