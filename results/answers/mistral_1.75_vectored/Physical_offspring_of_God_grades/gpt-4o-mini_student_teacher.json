  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a strong and accurate response in aligning the term \"Son of God\" with Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, rather than physical procreation. The student effectively emphasized the spiritual significance of the phrase and addressed the concern of preventing doctrinal errors through proper teaching. Great job!"
