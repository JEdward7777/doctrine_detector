  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern for doctrinal accuracy and retention of biblical terminology. It clearly explains that \"Son of God\" is a symbolic reference to Jesus Christ and emphasizes its spiritual significance rather than a literal physical offspring interpretation. The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian perspective on this theological concept."
