  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response accurately conveys that the phrase \"Son of God\" refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, rather than physical procreation. This aligns well with the correct answer, which also emphasizes Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God.\n\nRegarding the concern about proper teaching preventing doctrinal errors, this response demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical terminology and avoids potential misinterpretations. The emphasis on the spiritual significance of the phrase is particularly important in ensuring that readers understand its meaning within a Christian context.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more explicit examples or clarification on why it's important to distinguish between physical and spiritual relationships when considering Jesus' identity as the Son of God. However, overall, this response effectively communicates the correct understanding of the phrase and demonstrates a commitment to proper teaching."
