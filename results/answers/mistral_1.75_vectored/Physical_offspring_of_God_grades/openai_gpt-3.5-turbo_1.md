It is important to clarify that "Son of God" is a Christian symbolic reference to Jesus Christ, not a literal statement about Jesus being physically born of God. The phrase is meant to convey Jesus' divine nature and his role as a savior and son of God. It is important to emphasize that this phrase has spiritual significance and should be understood in that context.

Comment: The response does an excellent job in addressing the concern by emphasizing the importance of teaching the correct understanding of "Son of God" to prevent doctrinal errors and maintain biblical terminology. It effectively conveys the Christian perspective on the term, highlighting Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God rather than physical procreation. The only room for improvement would be to further accentuate the significance of correctly interpreting and teaching this concept in relation to Christian doctrine.
