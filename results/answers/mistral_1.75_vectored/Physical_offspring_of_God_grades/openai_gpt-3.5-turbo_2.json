  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively conveys the Christian belief that \"Son of God\" refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation. It addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of proper teaching to prevent doctrinal errors and retain biblical terminology. The only slight improvement could have been to further highlight the connection between this understanding and the foundational truths of the Christian faith. Overall, a strong and faithful response."
