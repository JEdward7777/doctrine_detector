It is important to clarify that "Son of God" is a Christian symbolic reference to Jesus Christ, not a literal statement about Jesus being physically born of God. The phrase is meant to convey Jesus' divine nature and his role as a savior and son of God. It is important to emphasize that this phrase has spiritual significance and should be understood in that context.
