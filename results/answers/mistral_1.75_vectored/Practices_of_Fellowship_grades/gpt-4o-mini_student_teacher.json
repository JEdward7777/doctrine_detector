  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing various ways early Christians expressed their fellowship, including prayer, worship, Bible study, acts of service, fellowship meals, prayer and intercession, encouragement and support, and sharing the Gospel. While the answer goes beyond the specified reference answer by incorporating additional practices, it aligns well with a Christian worldview emphasizing the importance of community, service, and sharing the love of Christ. The student effectively addressed the concern by illustrating how recognizing these practices can help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other."
