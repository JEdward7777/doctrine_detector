Early Christians expressed their fellowship in several ways. Here are some of the ways they did this:

1. Prayer and worship: Early Christians prayed and worshipped together to strengthen their faith and to encourage each other. They would gather for prayer and worship, and also to share the Holy Scriptures with one another.

2. Bible study: The early Christians were devoted to studying the Bible. They would gather to read and interpret the scriptures, and to apply them to their lives.

3. Acts of service: Early Christians were called to serve others. They would help those in need, care for the sick and the poor, and share the love of Christ with everyone they met.

4. Fellowship meals: The early Christians had special meals called "Agape Feasts" where they would come together to eat and pray. These feasts were a way to celebrate the love of Jesus and to strengthen their relationship with one another.

5. Prayer and intercession: Early Christians also prayed for one another. They would pray for each other's needs, for guidance, and for protection.

6. Encouragement and support: Early Christians encouraged and supported one another. They would pray for one another, offer words of encouragement, and help each other in times of need.
