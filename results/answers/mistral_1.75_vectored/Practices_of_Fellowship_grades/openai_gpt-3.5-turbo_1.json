The response demonstrates a good understanding of how fellowship was practiced in early Christian communities. However, the answer could be enhanced by directly addressing the concern raised about how recognizing these practices can help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other. Implementing a direct connection between the historical practices of fellowship and their relevance for contemporary Christian community building would have strengthened the response further."
