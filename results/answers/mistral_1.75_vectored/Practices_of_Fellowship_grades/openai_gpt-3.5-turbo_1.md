Early Christians expressed their fellowship in several ways. Here are some of the ways they did this:

1. Prayer and worship: Early Christians prayed and worshipped together to strengthen their faith and to encourage each other. They would gather for prayer and worship, and also to share the Holy Scriptures with one another.

2. Bible study: The early Christians were devoted to studying the Bible. They would gather to read and interpret the scriptures, and to apply them to their lives.

3. Acts of service: Early Christians were called to serve others. They would help those in need, care for the sick and the poor, and share the love of Christ with everyone they met.

4. Fellowship meals: The early Christians had special meals called "Agape Feasts" where they would come together to eat and pray. These feasts were a way to celebrate the love of Jesus and to strengthen their relationship with one another.

5. Prayer and intercession: Early Christians also prayed for one another. They would pray for each other's needs, for guidance, and for protection.

6. Encouragement and support: Early Christians encouraged and supported one another. They would pray for one another, offer words of encouragement, and help each other in times of need.

7. Sharing the Gospel: Early Christians shared the Gospel with others. They would invite people to come and hear about the love of Jesus, and to join them in their Christian walk.

These are just a few examples of how early Christians expressed their fellowship. They were committed to loving and serving one another, and to sharing the love of Jesus with everyone they met.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive list of ways early Christians expressed their fellowship, incorporating elements such as prayer, worship, Bible study, acts of service, fellowship meals, prayer and intercession, encouragement and support, and sharing the Gospel. The response demonstrates a good understanding of how fellowship was practiced in early Christian communities. However, the answer could be enhanced by directly addressing the concern raised about how recognizing these practices can help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other. Implementing a direct connection between the historical practices of fellowship and their relevance for contemporary Christian community building would have strengthened the response further.
