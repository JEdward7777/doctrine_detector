The biblical reference to Jesus always being with us adds depth to the explanation. However, the answer could be strengthened by further emphasizing the importance of faith, surrender, and submission in calling out to the Lord in prayer. Additionally, discussing the role of the Holy Spirit in intercession and prayer could have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
