  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response thoroughly explains the significance of calling out to the Lord as seeking God urgently for help, trusting in Him, and depending on Him. It also reflects the importance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life from a Christian perspective. The integration of relevant Bible verses and the emphasis on inviting Jesus into one's life enrich the explanation. Well done!"
