However, it lacks precision in explaining the theological nuances of predestination, such as the belief in God's sovereign election of some individuals to salvation according to His will, rather than a general plan for everyone. Additionally, it could have been clearer in emphasizing that salvation is ultimately a result of God's grace and not based on individual actions or choices. More doctrinal accuracy and specificity would have improved the answer."
