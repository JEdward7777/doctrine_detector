  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately defines the concept of \"predestine\" in a Christian context. They correctly explain that it refers to God having a specific plan and purpose for every individual. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific role of faith in God's plan of salvation. The reference answer is more concise and focuses solely on the aspect of eternal life, while the student's answer provides a broader perspective."
