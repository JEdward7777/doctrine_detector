## [Answer](../Predestination_Meaning.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In Christianity, "predestine" refers to the belief that God has a specific plan and purpose for everyone who is born into the world. This includes both Christians and non-Christians. The Bible teaches that God loves all people and wants to save them, but also that He will ultimately fulfill His plan according to His will. This includes the salvation of those who accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and the ultimate judgment and eternal life for those who do not.
