  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided some good insights on blessings and responsibilities of adopted children of God, but overlooked the key privilege mentioned in Romans 8:14-15 which is the ability to call God 'Abba, Father' symbolizing a deep, personal relationship with Him. Encouraging the student to focus more on the specific biblical passages in future responses."
