## [Answer](../Privileges_of_Sonship.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In Romans 8:14-15, we are told that all who have been baptized in the Holy Spirit will be filled with the Holy Spirit. This is a promise of spiritual renewal and sanctification.

In addition to this, we are also promised that we will be blessed and will inherit a blessing. This blessing is not just a spiritual blessing, but also a physical blessing. It is a promise of God's love and blessings for us, which includes forgiveness, peace, and salvation.

As followers of Jesus Christ, we are also called to be holy and to live according to the teachings of Jesus Christ. We are called to love one another, to serve one another, and to share the love of Jesus Christ with others.

In addition to these blessings, we are also promised that we will be protected by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit will guide and protect us, and will help us to overcome any trials or difficulties that may come our way.

Overall, being adopted into the family of God is a great privilege and blessing. We are called to follow Jesus Christ and to live a life of love, service, and obedience.
