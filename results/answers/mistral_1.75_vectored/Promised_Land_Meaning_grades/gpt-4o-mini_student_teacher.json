  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response captures the general idea of the Promised Land as a symbol of God's promise and faithfulness to Abraham and his descendants. However, the answer lacks specificity by not directly mentioning the land of Canaan as the location of the Promised Land in the context of God's covenant with Abraham. A stronger connection to the biblical narrative and details would have improved the answer."
