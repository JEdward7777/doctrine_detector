  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The answer provides some examples of verses using the term \"Daughter of Zion,\" but there are inaccuracies and lack of depth in the explanation. The references provided do not accurately reflect the content of the verses. Additionally, more scriptural references and a deeper theological explanation of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" and its significance in biblical prophecies would be beneficial. The connection to the Bride of Christ is mentioned but could be further elaborated upon. Overall, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness and depth in understanding the biblical concept of the Daughter of Zion."
