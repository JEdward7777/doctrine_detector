  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some correct information about the term \"Daughter of Zion\" being related to holiness and obedience to God, but the student fails to recognize the prophetic and historical context in which this term is used. The student's examples are not accurate biblical references, and the answer lacks depth and understanding of the term's significance in relation to Israel and God's prophecies. The student should focus on studying the biblical context and seeking a deeper understanding to improve their answer."
