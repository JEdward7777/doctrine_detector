While it mentions that the term is used to convey messages of hope or warning, it does not delve into the specific biblical passages provided as examples or explore the connection between the Daughter of Zion and the Bride of Jesus Christ. To better apply the scriptures today, a more nuanced understanding of the historical and prophetic context of this term is necessary.\n\nThe concern was recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context to better apply the scriptures today. The response does not fully address this concern as it only provides a general overview without exploring the specific biblical passages or their historical context."
