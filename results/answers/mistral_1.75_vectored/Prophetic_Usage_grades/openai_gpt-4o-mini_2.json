The examples given, while not entirely accurate, attempt to convey the concept of being holy and obedient to God. However, there is a lack of depth in connecting the prophetic nature of the term and its historical context to effectively apply the scriptures today. More specific references to the historical context and how understanding the term can impact modern Christian life would enhance the response."
