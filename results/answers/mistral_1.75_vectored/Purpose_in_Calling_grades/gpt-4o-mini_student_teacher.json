  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with detailed steps on how to discern one's calling or purpose as described in the Bible. The response includes important elements such as prayer, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, and seeking counsel from wise Christian leaders. However, the answer could have been more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher, focusing on prayer, studying Scripture, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, and understanding one's gifts and passions. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could benefit from more focus and alignment with the core principles outlined in the reference answer."
