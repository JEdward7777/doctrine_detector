  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of exhortation in the New Testament, focusing on encouraging believers in their faith journey and emphasizing key aspects such as holy living, forgiveness, and sharing the Gospel. However, the answer lacks a specific mention of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will, which is the primary purpose of exhortation according to the reference answer provided. To improve, the student could incorporate this key aspect into their explanation to align more closely with the Christian worldview perspective."
