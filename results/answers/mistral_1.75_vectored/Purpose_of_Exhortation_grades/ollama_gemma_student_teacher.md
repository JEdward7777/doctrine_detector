The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage and strengthen believers in their faith, love, and obedience to Christ. This includes encouraging believers to live a holy life, to be filled with the Holy Spirit, to pray for one another, to forgive one another, to love one another, and to serve one another. Exhortation also involves encouraging believers to share the Gospel message with others and to spread the love of Jesus to all people.

**Comment:** While the student's answer correctly identifies the overall purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, it lacks nuance and fails to capture the broader scope of this ministry. Exhortation goes beyond mere persuasion and includes uplifting and strengthening believers in their faith journey. The answer would benefit from referencing specific biblical examples of exhortation that emphasize encouragement, growth in Christ, and serving others.
