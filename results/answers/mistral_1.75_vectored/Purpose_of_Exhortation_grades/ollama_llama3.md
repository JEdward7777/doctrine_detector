## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage and strengthen believers in their faith, love, and obedience to Christ. This includes encouraging believers to live a holy life, to be filled with the Holy Spirit, to pray for one another, to forgive one another, to love one another, and to serve one another. Exhortation also involves encouraging believers to share the Gospel message with others and to spread the love of Jesus to all people.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 60.

The response partially addresses the concern of understanding the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey, but it falls short in several areas. While it mentions some general purposes of exhortation, such as encouraging believers to live a holy life and share the Gospel with others, these points are not specifically rooted in Scripture. Additionally, the response does not fully address the concern by failing to provide a clear biblical basis for the importance of exhortation.

The given answer is incorrect, which also affects the score. The correct understanding of exhortation's primary purpose is provided in the given response, emphasizing encouragement and strengthening believers in their faith, love, and obedience to Christ.

To improve this response, it would be helpful to provide specific biblical passages or verses that support the purposes of exhortation mentioned, as well as a more nuanced understanding of how these purposes relate to the larger Christian worldview.
