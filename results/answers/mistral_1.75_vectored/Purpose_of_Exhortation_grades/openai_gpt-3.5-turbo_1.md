Comment: While the response correctly emphasizes the importance of encouraging believers to avoid sin and follow God's will, it does not fully address the biblical basis for exhortation in terms of strengthening faith, love, and obedience to Christ. The response could benefit from integrating more Scriptural references and insights on how exhortation plays a key role in nurturing believers in their spiritual journey.
