  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response captures the essence of exhortation but lacks depth in explaining the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. It correctly emphasizes encouraging believers in their faith, love, and obedience to Christ, but could be further strengthened by referencing specific biblical passages or principles that support the importance of exhortation in guiding fellow believers."
