The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage and strengthen believers in their faith, love, and obedience to Christ. This includes encouraging believers to live a holy life, to be filled with the Holy Spirit, to pray for one another, to forgive one another, to love one another, and to serve one another. Exhortation also involves encouraging believers to share the Gospel message with others and to spread the love of Jesus to all people.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response captures the essence of exhortation but lacks depth in explaining the biblical basis for encouraging others in their faith journey. It correctly emphasizes encouraging believers in their faith, love, and obedience to Christ, but could be further strengthened by referencing specific biblical passages or principles that support the importance of exhortation in guiding fellow believers.
