The inclusion of these key elements aligns well with Christian teachings. However, a deeper exploration and explanation of how specific actions can manifest holiness in daily life could enhance the answer. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate example and source of holiness would further strengthen the response."
