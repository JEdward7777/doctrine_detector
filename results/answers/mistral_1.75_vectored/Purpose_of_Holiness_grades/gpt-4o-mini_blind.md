As Christians, we are called to live a life that is holy and set apart for God's purpose. This means living in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Holy Bible. Here are some ways we can do this:

1. Prayer: Praying regularly and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit is an important part of living a holy life. We should pray for strength, wisdom, and guidance in all things.

2. Love: Love is the foundation of our Christian faith. We are called to love one another as Jesus loves us. This means loving our neighbors, forgiving those who have wronged us, and serving others in love.

3. Obedience: We are called to obey Jesus Christ and His teachings. This includes loving the Lord with all our heart, soul, mind, and spirit, and loving our neighbor as ourselves.

4. Fruit of the Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit will guide us to produce fruit in our lives. These fruits include love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, humility, meekness, and love.

5. Holy Scripture: The Holy Bible is the Word of God and is our guide in living a holy life. We should read and study the Bible regularly, praying for guidance and wisdom.

6. Sacramental Gifts: We are also called to receive the sacramental gifts of baptism and the Holy Eucharist. These gifts are meant to strengthen and nourish us in our spiritual journey.

7. Servant Ministry: We are called to serve others in love and humility. This includes serving those in need, caring for the sick and the poor, and sharing the love of Jesus with others.

Living a life that is holy and set apart for God's purpose is not just about following rules or doing good deeds. It is about loving God deeply and loving others as He loves us.

Grade: 85

Comment: The answer provides a solid foundation on living a holy life as a Christian by emphasizing the importance of prayer, love, obedience, the fruit of the Holy Spirit, Holy Scripture, sacramental gifts, and servant ministry. The inclusion of these key elements aligns well with Christian teachings. However, a deeper exploration and explanation of how specific actions can manifest holiness in daily life could enhance the answer. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate example and source of holiness would further strengthen the response.
