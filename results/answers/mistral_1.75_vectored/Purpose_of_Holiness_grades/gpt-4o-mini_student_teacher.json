  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer on how Christians can live a life considered 'holy' and set apart for God's purpose. They emphasized the importance of prayer, love, obedience, the fruits of the Holy Spirit, Holy Scripture, sacramental gifts, and servant ministry. However, the student's answer lacked a direct reference to following God's commandments and the transformative work of the Holy Spirit, as highlighted in the reference answer. Emphasizing these aspects would have further solidified the student's response from a Christian worldview perspective."
