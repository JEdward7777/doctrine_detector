## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Parables.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings was to teach and guide his followers, as well as to fulfill the prophets' commandments. Parables were a way to convey important spiritual truths in a simple and memorable way. They also helped to fulfill the prophets' commandment to teach and pray for those who persecuted him.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
60.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60. While the student correctly identifies that Jesus used parables to teach important spiritual truths in a simple and memorable way, they miss the crucial aspect of Jesus using parables to reveal deeper spiritual truths to those who were open to receiving them while concealing these truths from those who were hardened in their hearts. Additionally, the mention of fulfilling the prophets' commandments in relation to using parables could be further explained or supported. Overall, the response lacks depth and clarity in fully understanding the purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings.
