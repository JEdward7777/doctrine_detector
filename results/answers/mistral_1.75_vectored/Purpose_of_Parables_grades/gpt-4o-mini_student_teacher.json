  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60.\n\nWhile the student acknowledges that Jesus used parables to teach important spiritual truths, they miss the key aspect of parables in revealing truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe. The student did mention fulfilling the prophets' commandments, which is an interesting point but not directly related to the primary purpose of using parables as explained in the reference answer. Overall, the student's response demonstrates some understanding but lacks the depth of insight into the specific purpose of Jesus using parables as per Christian beliefs."
