## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Parables.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings was to teach and guide his followers, as well as to fulfill the prophets' commandments. Parables were a way to convey important spiritual truths in a simple and memorable way. They also helped to fulfill the prophets' commandment to teach and pray for those who persecuted him.

60.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 60.

While the student acknowledges that Jesus used parables to teach important spiritual truths, they miss the key aspect of parables in revealing truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe. The student did mention fulfilling the prophets' commandments, which is an interesting point but not directly related to the primary purpose of using parables as explained in the reference answer. Overall, the student's response demonstrates some understanding but lacks the depth of insight into the specific purpose of Jesus using parables as per Christian beliefs.
