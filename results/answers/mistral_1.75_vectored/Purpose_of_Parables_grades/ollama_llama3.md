## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Parables.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings was to teach and guide his followers, as well as to fulfill the prophets' commandments. Parables were a way to convey important spiritual truths in a simple and memorable way. They also helped to fulfill the prophets' commandment to teach and pray for those who persecuted him.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
70.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response a 70.

The response does acknowledge that Jesus used parables to convey important spiritual truths, which aligns with the given answer. It also mentions that parables helped fulfill prophets' commandments, which shows an understanding of the broader context and purpose behind Jesus' teaching methods. However, the response does not fully capture the nuance of Jesus' intentions, as stated in the given answer, where he used parables to reveal truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe.

To improve this grade, the response could further elaborate on how Jesus' use of parables was a deliberate choice to conceal spiritual truths from those who did not have faith. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the implications for faith and the importance of discernment in interpreting Jesus' teachings.
