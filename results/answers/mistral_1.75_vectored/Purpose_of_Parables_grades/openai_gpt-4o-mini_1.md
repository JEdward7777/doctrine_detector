Comment: The response accurately identifies the purpose of Jesus using parables to explain and teach moral truths while distinguishing between those who believe and those who do not. It effectively addresses the concern about understanding Jesus' teaching methods and their implications for faith. However, a slightly higher grade could be achieved by expanding on how parables not only reveal truth to disciples but also serve as a call to action and transformation in one's faith journey.
