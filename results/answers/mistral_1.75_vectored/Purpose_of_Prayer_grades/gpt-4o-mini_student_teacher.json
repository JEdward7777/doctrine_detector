  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's answer does touch on some of the key purposes of prayer such as seeking guidance and protection, worshiping God, confessing sins, praying for others, and praying for peace, there is a lack of focus and depth in the explanation. The student could have elaborated more on each purpose and tied them back more directly to biblical references. Additionally, the student included some inaccuracies in the Bible verses cited, showing a need for greater attention to detail and accuracy. Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic but lacks precision and depth."
