  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good understanding of trials and tests as a means for growth in faith and love, as well as learning important lessons. However, the answer could have emphasized more on the aspect of how tests expose sin, help believers turn away from sin, and draw them closer to God, as per the reference answer from the teacher. Integrating this aspect more prominently would have enhanced the student's response with a Christian-specific worldview."
