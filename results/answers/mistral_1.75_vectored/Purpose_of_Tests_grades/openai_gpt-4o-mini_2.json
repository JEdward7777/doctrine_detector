However, there is some focus on God's love and blessings rather than specifically addressing how tests can expose sin and help believers turn away from sin. While the response provides valuable insights, it could have been strengthened by directly addressing how understanding the nature of tests impacts a believer's response to difficult circumstances and emphasizing the role of repentance and drawing closer to God in response to trials."
