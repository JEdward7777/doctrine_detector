  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer shows some effort in connecting the soul to a person's relationship with God using Bible verses, but there are numerous inaccuracies and inconsistencies present. The student needs to improve their understanding of Biblical concepts and ensure that their interpretations align with Christian doctrine. The response lacks depth and clarity in addressing the topic adequately. Further study and refinement of theological knowledge are recommended."
