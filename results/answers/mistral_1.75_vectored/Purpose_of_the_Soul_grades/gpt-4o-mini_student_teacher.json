  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided a lengthy response but veered off track by repeating and not fully connecting the content to the relationship between the soul and a person's connection to God as outlined in the scripture. The student should have focused on quality rather than quantity and made stronger connections to biblical teachings on the soul's role in one's relationship with God."
