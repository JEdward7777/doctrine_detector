  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThis response does not effectively address the concern about recognizing the soul's role in relation to God, nor does it provide a clear understanding of the soul's role in a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. The response is heavily focused on Jesus' quotes, but these quotes are not relevant to the discussion of the soul's role in relation to God.\n\nThe answer provided as the basis for grading is somewhat vague and doesn't accurately reflect the content of the response. A more accurate answer would be something like \"The soul is not explicitly defined or discussed in this response.\"\n\nTo improve, the writer could focus on providing a clear and concise explanation of the soul's role in relation to God, using biblical passages and examples to support their argument."
