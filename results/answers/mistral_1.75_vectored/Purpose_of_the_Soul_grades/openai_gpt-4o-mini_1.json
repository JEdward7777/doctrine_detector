  "grade_comment": "Grade: 35\n\nComment: The response starts off well by acknowledging the importance of the soul in relation to God, indicating a spiritual connection and accountability in actions and choices. However, the subsequent points seem to repeat and lose focus, drifting away from the concern of how recognizing the soul's role can influence a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. The response lacks depth and coherence, leading to a lower grade. The answer could have been more focused and developed to better address the concern provided."
