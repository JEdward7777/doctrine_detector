  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response starts off well by acknowledging the soul's role in relation to God as indicating a spiritual connection and accountability in actions and choices. However, the response quickly deviates into a list of Bible verses without expanding on how recognizing the soul's role influences a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. The response lacks depth and analysis, failing to effectively address the concern provided. There is a need for more explanation and application of the biblical teachings to the concern at hand in order to receive a higher grade."
