  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The answer provided lacks accuracy in describing the term \"Rabbi\" in the context of Christian teaching. In Christian theology, a Rabbi is a Jewish title meaning \"teacher\" or \"master,\" and it specifically refers to a Jewish religious leader or scholar. The response's focus on Jesus as a servant is commendable but misses the mark on addressing the term \"Rabbi\" within Christianity. Further explanation and clarity are needed to improve the grade."
