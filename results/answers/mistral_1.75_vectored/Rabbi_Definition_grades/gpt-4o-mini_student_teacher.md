## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The student's answer is vague and lacks specific understanding of the term 'Rabbi' in the context of Christian teaching. While it is commendable to emphasize love and service towards all people, the answer does not address the significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament as requested. The student needs to further study the theological significance of the term 'Rabbi' within Christian teachings.
