## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the context of Christian teaching, "Rabbi" is not a specific term. The Bible teaches us to love and serve all people, including those from the Jewish faith. It is important to remember that Jesus was also a servant of the Lord and a servant of the people.

## Grade: 70/100

**Comment:** While the student's answer is accurate in stating that the term "Rabbi" is not explicitly used in Christian teaching, it fails to address the concern regarding the significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. The answer could benefit from acknowledging the historical and cultural context in which the term "Rabbi" was used, and how it might be understood within the New Testament.
