  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response acknowledges that \"Rabbi\" is not a specific Christian term, which shows some understanding of the concern to consider the Jewish context. However, it fails to explicitly connect the concept of rabbinic teaching to the New Testament, which is the primary focus of the concern. Additionally, while the response mentions Jesus' servanthood, it does not explore how this relates to the significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. To achieve a higher grade, the response would need to demonstrate a clearer understanding of the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament and its connection to Christian teachings."
