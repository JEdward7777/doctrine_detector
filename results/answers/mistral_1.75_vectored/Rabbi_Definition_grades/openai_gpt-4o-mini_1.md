## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the context of Christian teaching, "Rabbi" is not a specific term. The Bible teaches us to love and serve all people, including those from the Jewish faith. It is important to remember that Jesus was also a servant of the Lord and a servant of the people.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response acknowledges the correct definition of "Rabbi" in the Jewish context, which is important for understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament. However, it lacks explicit connections to Christian teaching or the biblical perspective on the term. To improve, the response could have elaborated on how Jesus interacted with the Rabbis of his time or how rabbinic teaching influenced early Christianity.
