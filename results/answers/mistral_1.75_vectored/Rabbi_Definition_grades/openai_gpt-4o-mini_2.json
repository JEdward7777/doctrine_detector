While the response ties the term to Jewish religious teaching, it misses the opportunity to discuss the specific role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament from a Christian perspective. It would have been stronger if it had connected the term \"Rabbi\" to the interactions of Jesus with Jewish religious leaders and how their teachings were contrasted in the New Testament."
