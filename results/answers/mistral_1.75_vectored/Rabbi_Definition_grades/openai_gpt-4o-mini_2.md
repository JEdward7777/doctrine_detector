## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the context of Christian teaching, "Rabbi" is not a specific term. The Bible teaches us to love and serve all people, including those from the Jewish faith. It is important to remember that Jesus was also a servant of the Lord and a servant of the people.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response acknowledges the correct definition of the term "Rabbi" in Jewish context. While the response ties the term to Jewish religious teaching, it misses the opportunity to discuss the specific role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament from a Christian perspective. It would have been stronger if it had connected the term "Rabbi" to the interactions of Jesus with Jewish religious leaders and how their teachings were contrasted in the New Testament.
