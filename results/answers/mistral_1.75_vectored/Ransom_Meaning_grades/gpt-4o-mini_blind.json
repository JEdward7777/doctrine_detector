However, the answer lacks depth and does not fully delve into the theological significance of Jesus being the ransom. It would have been beneficial for the student to explain more about the atonement theory, the concept of substitutionary sacrifice, and how Jesus' death satisfies the justice of God. Expanding on these theological aspects would have enhanced the overall explanation."
