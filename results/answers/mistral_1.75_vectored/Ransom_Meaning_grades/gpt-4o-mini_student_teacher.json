  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of Jesus being referred to as a ransom in Christianity, touching on His sacrifice and redemption of sinners. However, there is a lack of clarity and organization in the explanation, and some points are repeated unnecessarily. The response could be improved with a deeper exploration of the theological implications of Jesus' role as a ransom in relation to redemption and salvation."
