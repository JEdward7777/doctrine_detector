The events leading to the destruction and subsequent rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem are deeply rooted in the Bible. Here is a brief summary:

1. Jesus' teachings and ministry in Jerusalem (Matthew 26-7).
2. Jesus' betrayal by Judas Iscariot, his trial, and crucifision (Matthew 26-27).
3. Jesus' resurrection and ascension (Matthew 28).
4. The Holy Spirit coming upon the early Christians (Acts 2).
5. The early Christian church spreading throughout Jerusalem and the Holy Land (Acts 2-4).
6. The persecution of the early Christians (Acts 5-7).
7. The Acts of the Apostles (Acts 9-10)
8. The vision of St. Paul (Acts 9).
9. The mission of St. Paul to spread the Gospel to the Gentiles (Acts 10).
10. The early Christian church continues to grow and spread throughout the world (Acts 13-Acts 28).

The specific events that led to the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem are not explicitly stated in the Bible. However, it is believed that the events mentioned above were part of the fulfillment of prophecy and the preparation for the coming of Jesus Christ.

The destruction of the temple was fulfilled in the book of Revelation (Revelation 22:1-7).

The rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem is also mentioned in the Bible. The New Testament book of Luke mentions that Jesus said, "I will come to you again to fulfill what is written in the Scripture (Luke 22:16)." This promise was fulfilled when Jesus came to Jerusalem to fulfill the prophets and to fulfill the promises made in the Old Testament.

The New Testament also teaches that Jesus will come again to fulfill the promises made in the Old Testament. This includes the promise to restore the temple in Jerusalem.

The restoration of the temple in Jerusalem is also mentioned in the book of Revelation (Revelation 22:1-7).
