  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response contains some relevant information about the significance of the Lord's Supper, including its origins and spiritual symbolism. However, there is a lack of focus on the specific reason why the apostle Paul established it as a regular practice for believers. The student should have directly addressed the importance of remembering and proclaiming the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ in alignment with the Christian worldview."
