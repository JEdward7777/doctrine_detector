It correctly acknowledges the role of the apostle Paul in establishing the practice of the Lord's Supper among believers. However, the response lacks depth in addressing the concern of recognizing the importance of the Lord's Supper in the life of the church and individual believers. More emphasis on the transformative power of the Lord's Supper in uniting believers with Christ and with one another would further enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
