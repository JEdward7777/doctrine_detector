However, it lacks depth and does not fully capture the theological significance of Jesus' rejection by the Jewish leaders. The explanation could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the theological reasons for their rejection and a clearer connection to the core Christian doctrines of salvation, sin, and the nature of Jesus as the Son of God. Consider elaborating on these aspects for a more comprehensive analysis."
