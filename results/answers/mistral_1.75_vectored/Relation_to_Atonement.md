## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Propitiation and Atonement are closely related terms in Christian theology. Both are related to the act of Jesus Christ's sacrifice for the salvification of humanity.

Propitiation refers to the act of making someone or something holy, and is done through the sacrificial offering of Jesus Christ. This act of propitiation was done to fulfill the commandment to love and serve God, and to make a way for people to be reconciled to God.

Atonement refers to the act of making things right or restoring a relationship that has been broken. In the context of Christianity, it refers to the act of Jesus Christ's sacrifice to restore the relationship between God and humanity, which had been broken by sin.

Both propitiation and atonement are central to the Christian message of salvation, and are fulfilled through the sacrificial love of Jesus Christ.
