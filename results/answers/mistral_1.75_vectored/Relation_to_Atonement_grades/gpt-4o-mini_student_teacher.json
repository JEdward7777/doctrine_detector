  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concepts of propitiation and atonement in Christian theology. They accurately describe both terms and acknowledge their significance in the context of salvation. However, the student could improve by highlighting the specific emphasis of propitiation in appeasing God's wrath, as noted in the reference answer provided by the teacher. This additional detail would enhance the clarity and depth of their explanation."
