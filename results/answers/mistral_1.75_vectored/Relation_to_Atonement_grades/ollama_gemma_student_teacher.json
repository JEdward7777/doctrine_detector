  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the relationship between propitiation and atonement within Christian theology. The explanation of propitiation as the act of making someone or something holy through sacrifice is accurate, and the connection to restoring the relationship between God and humanity through atonement is well-articulated. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific differences between the two terms as referenced in the teacher's answer."
