  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThis response does a good job of clarifying the differences and similarities between propitiation and atonement, as required by the concern. It correctly identifies that both terms are related to reconciliation between God and humanity, but also notes that propitiation specifically emphasizes appeasing God's wrath. The response is well-organized and easy to follow, and it provides a clear overview of the two concepts.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific biblical support for its claims, as well as exploring the implications of these concepts for the Christian life. Additionally, while the response is generally accurate, there are a few places where the language could be tightened up for greater clarity.\n\nOverall, this is a strong effort that demonstrates a good understanding of these important theological terms."
