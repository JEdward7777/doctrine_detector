It effectively clarifies that propitiation emphasizes appeasing God's wrath specifically, while atonement focuses on restoring the broken relationship between God and humanity. The language used is concise and accurate, demonstrating a solid understanding of the theological concepts involved. Overall, a well-executed response."
