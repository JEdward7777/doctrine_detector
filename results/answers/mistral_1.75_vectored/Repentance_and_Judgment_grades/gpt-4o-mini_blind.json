  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The answer provides a basic understanding of repentance and its importance in the Christian faith. However, it lacks depth and clarity in addressing the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God as per the question prompt. The response could benefit from including specific biblical references that directly connect repentance to God's wrath and the consequences of sin, rather than providing general teachings on repentance and forgiveness. Additionally, there are repetitive paragraphs in the answer which reduce the overall coherence and focus of the response. To improve, the student should delve deeper into the scriptural connection between repentance and God's wrath, offering a more comprehensive and focused explanation."
