  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good foundation on the importance of repentance but falls short in directly addressing the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God as outlined in the reference answer. The student should have focused more on how repentance plays a role in turning away from sin to avoid God's judgment. Additionally, there are repeated sections in the response, which could have been improved with more cohesive and concise explanations."
