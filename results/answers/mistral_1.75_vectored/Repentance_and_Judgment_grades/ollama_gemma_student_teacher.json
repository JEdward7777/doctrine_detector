  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern regarding the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God from a Christian perspective. The student provides a clear explanation of repentance as a necessary step for receiving forgiveness and salvation through Jesus Christ. However, the answer would be more comprehensive if it explicitly mentioned the connection between repentance and avoiding God's wrath as stated in the reference answer."
