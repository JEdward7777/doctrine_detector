  "grade_comment": "This response incorrectly states that Judas Iscariot was chosen to replace himself among the twelve apostles, which is not doctrinally accurate. Judas Iscariot was one of the original twelve apostles chosen by Jesus, but he later betrayed Jesus and took his own life. The replacement for Judas Iscariot was Matthias, who was chosen by the other apostles after Jesus' ascension. \n\nGrade: 50\n\nComment: The answer shows a basic understanding of Judas Iscariot being one of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus but fails to accurately identify Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas Iscariot. This answer would benefit from a more thorough understanding of this specific event in Christian history."
