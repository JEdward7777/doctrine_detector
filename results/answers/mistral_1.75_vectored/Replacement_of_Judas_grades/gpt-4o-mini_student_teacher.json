  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response accurately identifies Judas Iscariot as one of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus, but fails to correctly identify Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas Iscariot. Understanding this continuity in apostolic leadership is crucial in a Christian context. The student's answer lacks this key detail, leading to a lower grade."
