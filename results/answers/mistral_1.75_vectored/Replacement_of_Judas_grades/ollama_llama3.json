  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nThe response does mention Judas Iscariot, who was indeed one of Jesus' twelve apostles, but it fails to address the concern about recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The focus is solely on Judas' selection as an apostle without any mention of Matthias being chosen to replace him.\n\nTo better address the concern and receive a higher grade, the response could have explored how Matthias was selected by the remaining apostles (Acts 1:21-26) to take Judas' place, emphasizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension."
