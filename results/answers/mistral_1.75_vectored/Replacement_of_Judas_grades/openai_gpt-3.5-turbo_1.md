Comment: The response accurately addresses the concern by highlighting the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension through the selection of Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot. However, it could have been enhanced by also mentioning the importance of fulfilling the prophecy and divine plan in the selection of Matthias, connecting it to God's ultimate sovereignty and purpose in the narrative of apostolic succession.
