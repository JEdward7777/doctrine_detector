  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response correctly addresses the concern by pointing out the continuity of apostolic leadership after Judas' betrayal and death, highlighting Matthias as the one chosen to replace Judas. However, the initial statement about Jesus choosing Judas Iscariot is not directly relevant to the concern provided, which slightly reduces the grade."
