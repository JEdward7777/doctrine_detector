Grade: 80

Comment: The response correctly addresses the concern by mentioning the continuity of apostolic leadership through the selection of Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot. However, there is a slight deviation from the Christian worldview in the initial statement about Jesus choosing Judas Iscariot, as Judas was not ultimately part of the continuing apostolic leadership due to his betrayal and subsequent death.
