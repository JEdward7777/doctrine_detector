  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "The student's answer does mention faith in Jesus Christ as essential for salvation, aligning with the reference answer from the teacher. However, the student's response includes lengthy repetitions and does not directly address the requirement of repentance for salvation, as indicated in the reference answer. \n\nConsidering the student's answer does contain some relevant information but lacks clarity and focus, I would assign a grade of 65. The student's answer could benefit from being more concise and directly addressing the specific requirements for salvation outlined in the reference answer."
