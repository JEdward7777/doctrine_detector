  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly states that salvation is a gift from God's love and that it is received through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the student's response lacks clarity on the specific act of repentance that is required for salvation according to the Bible. Additionally, the student's inclusion of lengthy passages from the Bible without providing further context or explanation detracts from the overall clarity of the response."
