Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response does not accurately address how Peter addressed the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. The extensive repetition of "Jesus loves me, and I love you" while emphasizing love is commendable, it strays significantly from the context of Peter's specific message regarding the crucifixion. The student needs to focus on providing relevant and accurate information in their responses.
