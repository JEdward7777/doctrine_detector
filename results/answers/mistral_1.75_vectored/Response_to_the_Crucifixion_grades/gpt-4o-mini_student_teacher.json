  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10/100\n\nComment: The student's answer is completely off-topic and does not address the question at all. The student's response lacks understanding of the content regarding Peter's address to the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. The content of the response is not relevant to the concern of evaluating the early church's preaching and call to respond to the gospel. The student's answer is repetitive and does not demonstrate any knowledge or analysis of the specific events related to Peter's address."
