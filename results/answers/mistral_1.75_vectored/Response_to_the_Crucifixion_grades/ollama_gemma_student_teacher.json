  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 40/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer completely ignores the prompt and focuses solely on repeating a religious mantra. It fails to address the historical context or Peter's specific actions in response to the crowd regarding their role in Jesus' crucifixion. The answer lacks clarity and fails to demonstrate an understanding of the concern related to early church preaching and responding to the gospel."
