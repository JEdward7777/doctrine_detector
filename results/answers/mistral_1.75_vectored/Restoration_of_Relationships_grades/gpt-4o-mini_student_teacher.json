  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of restoration in Christian faith, emphasizing the renewal and transformation of the individual's heart and life through Jesus Christ. The answer beautifully captures the essence of God's desire to restore sinful people to Himself through forgiveness, grace, and a new life in Christ. The response aligns well with the reference answer, but could have further emphasized the significance of reconciliation in restoring the broken relationship with God caused by sin."
