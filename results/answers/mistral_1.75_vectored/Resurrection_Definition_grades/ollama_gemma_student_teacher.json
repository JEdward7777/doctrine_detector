  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately defines the term \"resurrection\" in a Christian context, emphasizing its spiritual and physical restoration of Jesus Christ. It also highlights its significance as the victory over sin and death, and the promise of eternal life.
