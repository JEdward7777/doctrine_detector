  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear definition of resurrection, explaining it as the spiritual and physical restoration of Jesus Christ, which aligns with the concern about understanding the fundamental concept of resurrection. The mention of Jesus' resurrection also reinforces the Christian perspective on life after death.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response could be more detailed and explicit in its explanation. For instance, it does not explicitly state that Jesus' resurrection is a singular event that has salvific implications for humanity. Additionally, while the response mentions eternal life, it does not fully explore the significance of Jesus' resurrection as a promise of new life to believers.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the concept of resurrection in Christianity, but could be more thorough and nuanced in its explanation."
