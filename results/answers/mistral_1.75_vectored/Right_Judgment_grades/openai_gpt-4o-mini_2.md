## [Answer](../Right_Judgment.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Luke 6:37 says, "For judgment is also a gift given to me. If you have any judgment that is important, let it be done in love and with a servant's heart." This verse teaches us that we should always approach judging others with love and humility. We are called to serve others and to judge them with love and compassion.

In addition to this, we must remember that we are also called to forgive and to pray for those who have wronged us. Jesus commands us to forgive anyone who has wronged us, even as He forgave us (Matthew 7:12). This means that we should always seek to forgive and to pray for those who have wronged us, even if they have not asked for forgiveness.

Furthermore, we must remember that we are also called to repent and to ask for forgiveness when we have wronged others. Jesus said, "If you have a servant who loves his Lord deeply, he will be happy to serve him and will be blessed and fulfilled. But whoever wants to become his servant must also serve him and love Him deeply. And I will give you a new commandment: that you love one another, just as I loved you. And anyone who loves whom I love is also a Christian.‚Äù (John 13:14-15).

This means that we must always strive to love and serve others, and to forgive and pray for those who have wronged us. We must also remember to repent and ask for forgiveness when we have wronged others. In this way, we can fulfill the command to love one another as Jesus loves us.
