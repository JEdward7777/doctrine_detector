  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The answer provides a decent explanation of how Christians reconcile the concept of God's wrath with His nature as loving and merciful. The student appropriately mentions the need for repentance and faith to receive God's love and mercy. However, there are some theological nuances that could be further elaborated on, such as the atonement work of Jesus Christ on the cross and the grace of God. Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific references to biblical passages that support the points made. Overall, while the answer is generally accurate, there is room for improvement in depth and clarity."
