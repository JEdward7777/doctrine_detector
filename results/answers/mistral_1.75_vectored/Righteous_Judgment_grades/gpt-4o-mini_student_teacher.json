The answer could be improved by emphasizing that God's wrath is a manifestation of His justice and holiness, in line with His loving and merciful nature, as demonstrated through the offer of salvation for those who repent and believe in Him. More focus on how these aspects work together harmoniously within God's character would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
