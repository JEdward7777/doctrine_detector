## [Answer](../Righteous_Judgment.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Christians believe that God is both loving and merciful, and also wants to fulfill His ultimate purpose of redeeming all people. However, this does not mean that God loves everyone unconditionally. The Bible teaches that God loves all people, but also that He loves us because He loves Jesus Christ, who came to save us from our sins.

In the Bible, we see examples of God's love and mercy in many ways, including His desire to forgive and heal those who are sick or broken. However, we also see God's wrath and judgment in the Bible, especially in the Old Testament.

The Bible teaches that God's love and mercy are always available to anyone who wants to receive them. But it also teaches that God's love and mercy are not meant to be received without repentance and faith.

In the Bible, Jesus teaches us to love one another as He loves us, and to forgive one another as He forgives us. This means that Christians should always strive to love and serve others, even if they have wronged us.

It is important for Christians to remember that God's love and mercy are always available to us, but that we must also repent and follow Jesus Christ to receive them.

Grade: 50

Comment: The student's answer generally touches on the coexistence of God's love, mercy, and wrath, but it lacks a clear and direct explanation of how these attributes coexist without contradiction in Biblical teaching. The answer could be improved by emphasizing that God's wrath is a manifestation of His justice and holiness, in line with His loving and merciful nature, as demonstrated through the offer of salvation for those who repent and believe in Him. More focus on how these aspects work together harmoniously within God's character would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
