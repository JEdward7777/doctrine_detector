It clearly explains that God's wrath is a part of His justice and holiness, and it serves to uphold His righteousness. Additionally, the answer correctly points out that God's love and mercy are demonstrated through the offer of salvation and forgiveness for those who repent and believe in Him. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific ways in which God's love and mercy are displayed in the Bible."
