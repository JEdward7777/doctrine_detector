## [Answer](../Righteous_Judgment.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Christians believe that God is both loving and merciful, and also wants to fulfill His ultimate purpose of redeeming all people. However, this does not mean that God loves everyone unconditionally. The Bible teaches that God loves all people, but also that He loves us because He loves Jesus Christ, who came to save us from our sins.

In the Bible, we see examples of God's love and mercy in many ways, including His desire to forgive and heal those who are sick or broken. However, we also see God's wrath and judgment in the Bible, especially in the Old Testament.

The Bible teaches that God's love and mercy are always available to anyone who wants to receive them. But it also teaches that God's love and mercy are not meant to be received without repentance and faith.

In the Bible, Jesus teaches us to love one another as He loves us, and to forgive one another as He forgives us. This means that Christians should always strive to love and serve others, even if they have wronged us.

It is important for Christians to remember that God's love and mercy are always available to us, but that we must also repent and follow Jesus Christ to receive them.
