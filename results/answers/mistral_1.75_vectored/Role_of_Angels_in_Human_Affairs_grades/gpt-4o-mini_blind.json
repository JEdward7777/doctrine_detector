  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45/100\n\nComments: While the student's response attempts to address the question of how angels serve God according to biblical references, there are significant inaccuracies and misinterpretations present. For example, the statement that Jesus sent seven angels to send peace and blessings to the persecuted (Matthew 26:47) is not found in the Bible. Additionally, the student's references to Psalm 90:16 do not accurately reflect the content of that verse. Furthermore, the response lacks depth and fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the roles of angels as depicted in the Bible. It would be beneficial for the student to study and accurately represent biblical references concerning angels' roles and activities in their service to God."
