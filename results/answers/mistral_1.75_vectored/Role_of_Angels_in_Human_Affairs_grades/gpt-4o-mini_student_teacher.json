  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 40.\n\nWhile the student provided several ways in which angels serve God according to biblical references, there are significant inaccuracies and misinterpretations in their explanation. For example, the student mentioned Jesus sending seven angels, which is not found in Matthew 26:47. Additionally, mixing up references from different biblical passages like Psalm 90:16, which does not relate to angels comforting and strengthening the faithful, is a concern.\n\nMoreover, the student's elaboration on angels serving as servants or intercessors does not align with the essential roles of angels as outlined in the Bible. The reference answer focuses on the core functions of angels in delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening believers, and communicating on behalf of God, which are more accurate and essential to understanding angelic roles in serving God.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated some knowledge of the topic but lacked precision and accuracy in their explanation. There is a need for improvement in aligning with biblical references and interpretations of the roles of angels."
