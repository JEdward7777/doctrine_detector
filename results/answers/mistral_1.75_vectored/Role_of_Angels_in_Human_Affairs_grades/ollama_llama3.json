  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student has provided a thorough and detailed answer that covers various ways in which angels serve God, including delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening His people, and communicating as if they are speaking for God. The examples from Scripture support their claims, and the student's description is clear and concise.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response could be even more effective. For example, while the student mentions that angels serve as intercessors (praying for people), this role is not explicitly mentioned in the given answer. Additionally, while the response touches on the idea of divine intervention, it does not fully explore how understanding the roles of angels can impact Christian perceptions of such intervention.\n\nOverall, I believe this response demonstrates a good understanding of angelic ministry and its relevance to Christian life, but could be more comprehensive and nuanced in its discussion."
