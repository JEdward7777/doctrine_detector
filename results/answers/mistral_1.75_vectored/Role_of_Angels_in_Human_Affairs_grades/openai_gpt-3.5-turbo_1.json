  "grade_comment": "Grade: 55\n\nComment: The response briefly mentions some ways angels serve God according to the Bible, but it lacks depth and specificity in explaining the roles of angels. It does not fully address the concern raised about the impact of understanding the roles of angels on how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives. Additionally, some of the scriptural references provided in the response are inaccurate or misattributed, which affects the overall accuracy of the information presented. Further elaboration and a more accurate representation of biblical teachings would strengthen the response."
