## [Answer](../Role_of_Angels_in_Human_Affairs.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Angels are mentioned many times in the Bible and serve God in various ways. Here are some of the ways they serve God:

1. Serving as messengers: Angels are sent by God to deliver messages to people. For example, the angel Gabriel came to Mary to announce that she would be blessed and become a virgin (Luke 2:10).

2. Protecting and guiding: Angels are also sent to protect and guide people. For example, Jesus sent seven angels to send peace and blessings to those who were persecuted (Matthew 26:47).

3. Encouraging and comforting: Angels are also sent to encourage and comfort people. For example, the angel of the Lord is sent to comfort and strengthen the faithful (Psalm 90:16).

4. Helping in prayer: Angels are also sent to help in prayer. For example, the Holy Spirit sends the Holy Angel to help us pray (Ephesians 3:12).

5. Serving as witnesses: Angels are also sent to witness to the love and faithfulness of God. For example, the angel of the Lord is sent to witness to the love and faithfulness of God (Psalm 90:16).

6. Serving as servants: Angels are also sent to serve as servants to people. For example, Jesus said, "I will always be with you, and I will come to fulfill this promise. I am going to send a servant to help you until I come to fulfill this promise" (John 17:17).

7. Serving as guardians: Angels are also sent to serve as guardians to protect and bless people. For example, Jesus said, "I will send a servant to help you until I come to fulfill this promise" (John 17:17).

8. Serving as intercessors: Angels are also sent to serve as intercessors to pray for people. For example, Jesus said, "And I will give you a new commandment, that whoever loves me will love me and serve me, and I will serve him. And I will be fulfilled in this commandment: 'Love me, and I will fulfill my commandment to love you.'‚Äù (John 13:14-15).

These are just a few examples of how angels serve God according to the Bible.
