## [Answer](../Role_of_Apostles_in_Early_Church.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The apostles were called to teach and foster community among believers. They did this by:

1. Praying for the Holy Spirit to guide them in their mission (Acts 2:46).

2. Teaching the Bible and sharing the love of Jesus Christ with people from all backgrounds (Acts 2:47).

3. Encouraging believers to come together for prayer, worship, and fellowship (Acts 2:42).

4. Serving one another in love and humility (Acts 2:25-46).

5. Sharing the love of Jesus with those who were persecuted and suffering (Acts 2:46).

These actions are a reminder that we are called to be a part of the Christian community and to serve one another in love and humility. We should also pray for the Holy Spirit to guide us in our mission to share the love of Jesus with others.
