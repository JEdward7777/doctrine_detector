  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed response on the actions of the apostles in teaching and fostering community among believers. They accurately referenced key verses from Acts to support their points. However, the answer could be improved by directly aligning with the teacher's reference answer, which focuses on the apostles emphasizing teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer as foundational elements for the growth and unity of the early church. The student's answer effectively highlights the importance of community, teaching, and service but could benefit from more alignment with the specific concern provided."
