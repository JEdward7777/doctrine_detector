  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response largely aligns with the concern of understanding community and teaching as integral aspects of church life as modeled by the apostles. The writer correctly identifies key actions taken by the apostles to foster community among believers, including teaching, prayer, worship, and fellowship. They also recognize the importance of serving one another in love and humility.\n\nHowever, while the response provides some biblical references (Acts 2:46, Acts 2:47, Acts 2:42), it could be strengthened by more explicit connections between the apostles' actions and Jesus Christ's teachings or His commission to the disciples. Additionally, the writer could have explored how these principles continue to apply today in terms of building and serving one another within the Christian community.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of teaching and community in the early church, but could be taken further by more explicitly highlighting Jesus Christ's role as the foundation for this life and mission."
