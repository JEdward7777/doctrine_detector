  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively expands on the given answer by providing specific examples of how the apostles practiced teaching, fellowship, sharing meals, and prayer in fostering community among believers. It aligns well with the concern regarding community and teaching as integral aspects of church life as modeled by the apostles within a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more direct references to Scripture to strengthen the biblical foundation of the points made. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
