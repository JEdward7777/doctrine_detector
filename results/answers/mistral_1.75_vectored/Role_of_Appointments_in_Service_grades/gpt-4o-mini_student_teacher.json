  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response outlining various ways Christians are called to fulfill their roles within the Church, including aspects of prayer, serving others, loving one another, growing in faith, sharing the Gospel, serving in the Church, and living a holy life. While the answer covers a broad range of responsibilities, it lacks specificity and direct alignment with the concern provided. The reference answer emphasizes serving others, using gifts for the edification of the Church, and advancing God's kingdom, which the student's response touches on but does not focus on exclusively. The student could improve by honing in on these key points with more clarity and depth."
