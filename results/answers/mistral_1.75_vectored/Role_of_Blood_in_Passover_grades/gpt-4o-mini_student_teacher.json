However, the response lacks a proper understanding of the specific Christian belief in sacrifice and atonement. The student does not directly address the concept of atonement or the importance of sacrifice in the Christian faith, which is a crucial aspect when discussing the significance of blood in both the Passover event and in Jesus' sacrifice. The biblical reference answer emphasizes the importance of God's protection and deliverance through the blood of the lamb on the doorposts, which is a key aspect related to sacrifice and atonement in Christian theology."
