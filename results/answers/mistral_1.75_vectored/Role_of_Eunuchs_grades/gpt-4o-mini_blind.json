However, it lacks depth and specific biblical references to support the claims made. The student could improve the response by including more direct references to the Bible that specifically address the role of eunuchs or individuals with unique roles in society as part of God's plan. Additionally, a clearer explanation of how eunuchs' service in royal courts aligns with Christian teachings on sacrificial love and service would strengthen the argument."
