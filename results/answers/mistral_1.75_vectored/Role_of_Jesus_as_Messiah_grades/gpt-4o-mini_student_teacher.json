They accurately explain that Jesus came to fulfill the promises of the Old Testament and establish the Kingdom of God. However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing Jesus' divine nature as the Son of God and how he fulfills the prophecy of ruling God's kingdom with righteousness forever. Additionally, the student could have elaborated more on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection in establishing the Kingdom of God."
