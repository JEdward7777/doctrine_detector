It effectively highlights Jesus' role in fulfilling the Old Testament prophecies and establishing the Kingdom of God. However, it could have further emphasized the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection in God's plan for humanity, which would have made the connection more explicit. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of Jesus' role in God's plan for humanity."
