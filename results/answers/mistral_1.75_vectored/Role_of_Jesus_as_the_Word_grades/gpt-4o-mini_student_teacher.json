  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how the title \"Word of God\" highlights Jesus' divine nature and role as a messenger of God in Christianity. The answer effectively discusses Jesus as the embodiment of God's love and salvation, the ultimate source of truth and guidance, and the sacrificial offering for the forgiveness of sins. However, the student's answer falls slightly short of the reference answer in clearly emphasizing that Jesus is God himself, fully revealing who God is and embodying God's message to humanity."
