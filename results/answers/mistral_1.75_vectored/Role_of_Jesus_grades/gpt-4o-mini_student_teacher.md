Comment: The student provided a solid understanding of Jesus' role in salvation as described in the Bible, emphasizing His role as Savior and highlighting His teachings and sacrificial death. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning the need for faith in Jesus for salvation, in line with the Christian belief that salvation is through faith alone in Christ.
