  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: The student's response shows a misunderstanding of the biblical account involving Nathan and King David. While they touched on the importance of repentance and forgiveness, the interpretation and connection to Jesus Christ are not accurate in this context. The parable Nathan used was specifically about a rich man who took a poor man's only beloved lamb, not related to Jesus Christ. The student should focus on a more accurate and contextual understanding of the biblical narrative."
