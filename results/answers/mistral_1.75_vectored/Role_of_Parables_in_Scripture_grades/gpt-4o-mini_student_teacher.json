  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some relevant information about the parable used by Nathan to confront King David, but there are significant inaccuracies and misinterpretations present. The student incorrectly connects the parable to Jesus Christ and misunderstands the core purpose of Nathan's use of the parable to expose David's sin. The focus on repentance and forgiveness is appropriate, but the response lacks the crucial element of addressing David's specific transgression. Further development and accuracy in understanding biblical narratives and their applications are needed for a higher grade."
