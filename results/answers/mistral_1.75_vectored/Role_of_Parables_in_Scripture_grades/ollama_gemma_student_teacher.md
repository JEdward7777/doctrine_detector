## [Answer](../Role_of_Parables_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The prophet Nathan utilized a parable to teach King David about the importance of repentance and forgiveness. He told a story about a person who was given a sheep and a lamb, and then went and took one of the lambs and used it to shepherd the sheep. This was a reference to the Bible's story of Jesus Christ, who came to fulfill the commandment to love and serve others.

Nathan then asked King David if he would do the same thing. He wanted to remind David of the importance of loving and serving others, and how important it is to repent and seek forgiveness when we have done wrong.

The parable was a powerful way for Nathan to teach King David about the importance of following God's commands and seeking forgiveness. It also showed that Jesus Christ is always willing to forgive us and help us to live a life of love and service.
