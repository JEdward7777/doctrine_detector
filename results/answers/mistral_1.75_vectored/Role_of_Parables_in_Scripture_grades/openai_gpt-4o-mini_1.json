  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a decent understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. The student accurately explains the purpose of Nathan's parable in revealing King David's sin and leading to repentance. However, the student veers off course by bringing in references to Jesus Christ and his teachings, which while relevant in a broader Christian context, are not directly related to the specific concern provided. Staying focused on Nathan's purpose in using the parable would have strengthened the response."
