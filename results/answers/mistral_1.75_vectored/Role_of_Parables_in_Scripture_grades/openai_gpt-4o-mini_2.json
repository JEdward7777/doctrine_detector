  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. They correctly identify the purpose of the parable told by the prophet Nathan to King David. However, their response somewhat conflates the story with references to Jesus Christ, which is not directly relevant to the specific concern provided. A clearer focus on the biblical narrative involving Nathan and David would have strengthened the answer."
