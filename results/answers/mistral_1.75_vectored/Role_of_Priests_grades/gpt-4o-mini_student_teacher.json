  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a comprehensive understanding of the responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, their answer deviated slightly from the specific biblical roles outlined in the reference answer. The student highlighted additional aspects such as serving as a symbol of Christ and protecting the people, which, while important, were not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer. To improve their grade, the student should focus on directly addressing the specific biblical roles outlined in the reference answer."
