  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a good job of explaining the biblical role of priests, highlighting their main responsibilities such as offering sacrifices, prayers, and teaching God's laws. It also correctly emphasizes the importance of priests serving as a symbol of Christ and protecting the people from harm. The only area for improvement is that it could have gone deeper in exploring the spiritual significance of these roles, such as how they reflect Jesus' own work on behalf of humanity.\n\nThe response does not fully align with the given answer, which specifically mentions performing religious rites, pronouncing blessings, but it does cover some of the main responsibilities mentioned. Overall, this is a strong and biblical response that effectively conveys the importance of priests in God's plan."
