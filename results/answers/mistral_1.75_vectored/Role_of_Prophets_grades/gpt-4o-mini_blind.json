However, it lacks specificity in discussing the prophetic role of speaking forth God's word, foretelling future events, and calling people to repentance and righteousness. Additionally, the mention of praying for the Holy Spirit is important but could have been further elaborated on in terms of the prophet's reliance on divine empowerment for their mission. Overall, while the answer captures some aspects of a prophet's role, it could benefit from more depth and clarity in alignment with biblical teachings on prophecy."
