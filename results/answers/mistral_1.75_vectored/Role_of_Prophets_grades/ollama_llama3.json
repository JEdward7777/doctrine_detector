However, it does not fully capture the comprehensive nature of a prophet's role as described in the Bible.\n\nThe primary focus on warning people to turn away from their sins is an important aspect of a prophet's message, but it does not account for the broader aspects of a prophet's ministry, such as teaching, guiding, and praying for the Holy Spirit. The response also lacks any explicit reference to Jesus Christ or the importance of sharing God's love and salvation with all people.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be beneficial to provide more context about the biblical role of prophets and their messages, including a broader understanding of their function beyond simply warning people about sin."
