However, it could be enhanced by mentioning additional aspects of a prophet's role such as sharing God's love and salvation, guiding people to follow Jesus Christ, and serving as a reminder of God's promises and unconditional love. This would provide a more comprehensive view in line with the Christian worldview of prophets."
