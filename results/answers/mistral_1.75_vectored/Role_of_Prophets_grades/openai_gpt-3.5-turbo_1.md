Comment: The response provides a solid understanding of the biblical role of prophets in delivering God's messages to the people, particularly in warning them to turn away from sin and obey God. However, it could be enhanced by mentioning additional aspects of a prophet's role such as sharing God's love and salvation, guiding people to follow Jesus Christ, and serving as a reminder of God's promises and unconditional love. This would provide a more comprehensive view in line with the Christian worldview of prophets.
