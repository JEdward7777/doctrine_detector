Comment: The response provides a good understanding of the primary role of a prophet in delivering messages from God to the people and emphasizing the importance of repentance and obedience. However, there is a lack of depth in addressing the broader scope of a prophet's role in sharing God's love, guiding people to follow Jesus, and serving as a messenger of God's promises. A more comprehensive explanation would enhance the overall response.
