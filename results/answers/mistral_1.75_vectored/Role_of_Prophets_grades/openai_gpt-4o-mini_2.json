However, the response lacks a nuanced understanding of the broader responsibilities of a prophet as outlined in the Bible, such as sharing God's love, teaching and guiding people to follow Jesus Christ, and praying for God's help. This demonstrates a partial understanding of the biblical role of prophets and their messages."
