Grade: 85

Comment: The response correctly identifies that the primary role of a prophet is to speak God's messages to the people and warn them to turn away from sin and obey God. However, the response lacks a nuanced understanding of the broader responsibilities of a prophet as outlined in the Bible, such as sharing God's love, teaching and guiding people to follow Jesus Christ, and praying for God's help. This demonstrates a partial understanding of the biblical role of prophets and their messages.
