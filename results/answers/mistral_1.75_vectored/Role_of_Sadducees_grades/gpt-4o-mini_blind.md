Grade: 10/100

Comment: The answer is incorrect as it inaccurately describes the Sadducees as a Christian group when in fact they were a Jewish sect. The responsibilities mentioned are also inaccurate as the Sadducees were primarily concerned with temple rituals and practices, such as overseeing sacrifices and maintaining the temple's operations, rather than Christian church administration. The answer lacks doctrinal accuracy and demonstrates a misunderstanding of historical context.
