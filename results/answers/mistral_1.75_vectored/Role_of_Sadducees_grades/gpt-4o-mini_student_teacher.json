  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: The student's answer shows a misunderstanding of the historical context of the Sadducees within the Jewish temple system. The response incorrectly describes the Sadducees as a Christian group with responsibilities related to the Christian church, rather than addressing their actual role in ancient Judaism. The student should focus on accurately portraying historical facts within the Christian worldview."
