Grade: 60

Comment: While the response correctly touches on the responsibilities of the Sadducees related to the temple complex and priestly tasks, it inaccurately conflates them with Christian beliefs and practices. The grade reflects the accurate content provided but is lowered due to the lack of connection to the historical context of religious leadership in Jesus' time from a Christian perspective.
