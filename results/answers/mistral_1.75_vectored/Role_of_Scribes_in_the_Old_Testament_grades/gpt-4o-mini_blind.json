  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "This response accurately describes some of the responsibilities of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures. However, it could benefit from a more specific and doctrinally precise explanation of the scribes' role. In a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the meticulous copying and transmission of the texts without error, as well as their role in keeping the integrity of God's Word intact. \n\nGiven these considerations, I would grade this response at 85. The student accurately touches on several key points but could enhance their explanation with more emphasis on the meticulous copying and transmission of the scriptures."
