  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer covers several responsibilities of scribes in preserving the Old Testament scriptures but lacks a specific focus on the crucial aspect of copying and preserving the text accurately. While they mention reciting, teaching, praying, interpreting, and applying the scriptures, the central role of meticulous copying and preservation is not explicitly highlighted. They demonstrate a good understanding of the general responsibilities of scribes but need to emphasize the critical role of accuracy in preserving the scriptures."
