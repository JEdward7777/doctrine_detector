  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of how the Bible teaches about prayer, love, serving others, and sharing the Gospel message, which are all important aspects of integrating Scripture into evangelism. However, the student could improve by providing specific examples like Philip and Paul from the Bible who used Scriptures to share the Gospel, as shown in the reference answer. This would enhance the depth and specificity of the response."
