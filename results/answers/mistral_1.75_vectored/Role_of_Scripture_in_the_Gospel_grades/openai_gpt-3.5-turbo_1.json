  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 70.\n\nWhile the student's response effectively highlights the importance of Scripture in evangelism and provides examples of how biblical figures like Philip and Paul utilized Scripture to share the Gospel message, the response lacks depth in explaining the integration of Scripture in communication of the Gospel. The student touches on the usage of Scripture in prayer, love, serving others, and sharing the Gospel message, but does not explicitly discuss how the Scriptures themselves play a direct role in communicating the Gospel effectively. To improve the grade, the student could have provided more specific and detailed examples of how Scripture is directly integrated into the communication of the Gospel message, showcasing its transformative power in reaching others with the good news of Jesus Christ."
