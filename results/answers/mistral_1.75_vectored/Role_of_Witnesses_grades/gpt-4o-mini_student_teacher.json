  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough list of witnesses and their role in the life and resurrection of Jesus, demonstrating a good understanding of the importance of witnesses in the New Testament. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the call for Christians to witness their faith and share personal experiences, as mentioned in the concern provided. Encouraging the student to connect the role of witnesses to their own faith and personal experiences within their response would enhance the Christian worldview perspective."
