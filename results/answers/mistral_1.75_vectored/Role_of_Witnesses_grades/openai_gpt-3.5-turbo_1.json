The inclusion of relevant Bible verses adds depth to the explanation. The response aligns well with the concern, highlighting the importance of Christians witnessing their faith and sharing personal experiences. A strong Christian worldview perspective is demonstrated in connecting the role of witnesses in the Bible to the call for believers to share their faith."
