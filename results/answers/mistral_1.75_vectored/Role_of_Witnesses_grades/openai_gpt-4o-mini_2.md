Witnesses play a significant role in the New Testament regarding the life and resurrection of Jesus. Here are some examples:

1. The witnesses who saw Jesus baptized by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1-4).
2. The witnesses who saw Jesus heal the sick, feed the hungry, and teach the Bible (Matthew 7:10; Matthew 9:1-12; Matthew 10:7-10).
3. The witnesses who saw Jesus pray for His followers (Matthew 6:39).
4. The witnesses who saw Jesus pray in the Garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26:39).
5. The witnesses who saw Jesus arrested and taken to the Roman authorities (Matthew 26:42).
6. The witnesses who saw Jesus before His trial (Matthew 26:46).
7. The witnesses who saw Jesus during His trial (Matthew 26:63).
8. The witnesses who saw Jesus being crucified (Matthew 27:39).
9. The witnesses who saw Jesus being buried (Matthew 27:66).
10. The witnesses who saw Jesus resurrected (Matthew 28:6).

These witnesses were important because they testified to the love, teachings, and sacrificial love of Jesus Christ. They also witnessed to His resurrection, which is a central message of Christianity.
