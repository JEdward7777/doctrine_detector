  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student provides a general overview of the responsibilities of the High Priest in Israel; however, there are theological inaccuracies in the response. It is important to clarify that the High Priest in Israel was not a spiritual leader in the Christian Church as Christianity as a distinct religion had not yet been established during the time of the High Priest in ancient Israel. Additionally, the mention of teachings of Jesus Christ is anachronistic in the context of the High Priest in Israel. The response could benefit from a clearer focus on the historical and religious context of the High Priest's role within ancient Israelite religious practices."
