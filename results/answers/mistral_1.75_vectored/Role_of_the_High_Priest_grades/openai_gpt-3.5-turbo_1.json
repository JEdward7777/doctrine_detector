However, the response could have delved further into the significance of the High Priest's role in the worship practices of Israel, particularly from a Christian worldview perspective. Expanding on the spiritual symbolism and foreshadowing of Christ's role as the ultimate High Priest offering the perfect sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins would have strengthened the explanation."
