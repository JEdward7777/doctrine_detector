However, the response could have delved deeper into the significance of the High Priest's role in the worship practices of Israel, specifically focusing on the importance of entering the most holy part of the tabernacle or temple to offer a special sacrifice once per year. An explicit connection to the Christian faith and the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest could have enhanced the explanation further."
