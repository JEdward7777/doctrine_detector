The Holy Spirit empowers a believer after they are born again by filling them with the Holy Spirit, which is a gift from God. This gift is given to all who believe in Jesus Christ and accept Him as their Lord and Savior.

The Holy Spirit comes into the heart of the believer and helps them to live a holy life. He guides and teaches the believer to love and serve others, to pray and worship God, and to share the good news of Jesus Christ with others.

The Holy Spirit also gives believers spiritual gifts that are meant to be used for the service of others. These gifts include love, joy, peace, faith, hope, and many other fruits of the Holy Spirit.

In addition to these blessings, the Holy Spirit also helps believers to overcome sin and temptation. He enables them to forgive and love others, even when they are being persecuted or treated poorly.

The Holy Spirit also helps believers to grow in their faith and to become more like Jesus Christ. He teaches them to love and serve others, to pray and worship God, and to share the good news of Jesus Christ with others.

Overall, the Holy Spirit empowers believers to live a holy life, to serve others, and to grow in their faith.

The response emphasizes key aspects such as filling believers with the Holy Spirit, guiding them in living a holy life, and enabling them to serve others with spiritual gifts.
