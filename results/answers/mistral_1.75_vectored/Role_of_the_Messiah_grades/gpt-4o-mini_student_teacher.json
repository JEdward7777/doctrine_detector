  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of roles that Jesus fulfilled according to the Bible, but it lacks focus on the key aspects of the Messiah as described in the reference answer. The reference answer highlights the Messiah as a prophet, a priest, and a king, and emphasizes the initiation of the New Covenant. This clarity is crucial for understanding Jesus's mission and authority in Christian belief. The student's response, although detailed, deviates from the central roles attributed to the Messiah in the Bible."
