However, there is a lack of clarity in connecting these roles to the specific description provided in the answer. While the response covers a broad range of roles, it could benefit from more direct reference to how these roles relate to being a prophet, priest, and king within the context of starting the New Covenant. Strengthening this connection would enhance believers' comprehension of Jesus's mission and authority."
