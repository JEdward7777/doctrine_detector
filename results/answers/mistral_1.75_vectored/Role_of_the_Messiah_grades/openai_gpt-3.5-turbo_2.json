It aligns with the statement provided in terms of Jesus being described as a prophet, a priest, and a king, and starting the New Covenant. However, there is room for improvement in explaining how these roles specifically relate to Jesus's mission and authority, which could enhance believers' understanding even more. Further clarification on the significance and impact of these roles in relation to Jesus's mission would strengthen the response."
