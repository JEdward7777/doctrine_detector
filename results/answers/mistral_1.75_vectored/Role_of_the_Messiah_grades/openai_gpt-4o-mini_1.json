However, the response could have further elaborated on how these roles tie into the concept of the Messiah as a prophet, priest, and king, and how these roles reflect Jesus's mission and authority. More explicit connections between the stated roles and the prophetic, priestly, and kingly aspects of the Messiah would have strengthened the response."
