  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response correctly states that the Israelites were instructed to gather manna for two days before the Sabbath, showing a basic understanding of the passage. However, there are some errors in spelling (\"Sabbum\" instead of Sabbath) and terminology (\"holy offering\" instead of portion for the Sabbath). Additionally, the explanation lacks depth and could benefit from elaborating on the significance of this instruction in the context of God's provision and the observance of the Sabbath. Further scriptural references or theological insights could enhance the response."
