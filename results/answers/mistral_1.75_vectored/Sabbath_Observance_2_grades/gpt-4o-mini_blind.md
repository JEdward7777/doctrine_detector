The Israelites were instructed to gather manna for two days before the Sabbum. They were also told to keep a portion of the manna as a holy offering to be used on the Sabbum. This was done so that they could remember and celebrate the Lord's love and protection during their time in the wilderness.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student's response correctly states that the Israelites were instructed to gather manna for two days before the Sabbath, showing a basic understanding of the passage. However, there are some errors in spelling ("Sabbum" instead of Sabbath) and terminology ("holy offering" instead of portion for the Sabbath). Additionally, the explanation lacks depth and could benefit from elaborating on the significance of this instruction in the context of God's provision and the observance of the Sabbath. Further scriptural references or theological insights could enhance the response.
