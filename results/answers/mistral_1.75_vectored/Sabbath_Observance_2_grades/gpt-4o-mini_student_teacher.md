## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Israelites were instructed to gather manna for two days before the Sabbum. They were also told to keep a portion of the manna as a holy offering to be used on the Sabbum. This was done so that they could remember and celebrate the Lord's love and protection during their time in the wilderness.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student's response shows a good understanding of the general concept of gathering manna before the Sabbath. However, there are some inaccuracies in the details provided, such as "Sabbum" instead of Sabbath and not specifying that the Sabbath is a day of rest according to God's command. The student did mention the importance of remembering the Lord's love and protection, which is relevant to observing the Sabbath. Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding but lacks precision and clarity in explaining the specific instructions given by God regarding the gathering of manna in relation to the Sabbath.
