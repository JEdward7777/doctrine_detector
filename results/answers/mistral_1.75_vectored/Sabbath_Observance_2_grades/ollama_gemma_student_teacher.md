## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Israelites were instructed to gather manna for two days before the Sabbum. They were also told to keep a portion of the manna as a holy offering to be used on the Sabbum. This was done so that they could remember and celebrate the Lord's love and protection during their time in the wilderness.

**Comment:** The student's answer accurately describes the instruction given to the Israelites regarding manna gathering in relation to the Sabbath. However, it lacks the specific detail mentioned in the reference answer about gathering twice the amount. Including this additional information would have strengthened the student's response.
