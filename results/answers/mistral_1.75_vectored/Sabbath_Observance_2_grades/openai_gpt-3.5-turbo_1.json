It acknowledges the practical aspect of ensuring they had enough to eat. However, the response could improve by emphasizing the spiritual significance of observing the Sabbath as a command from God to rest, remember His provision, and honor Him as a holy day. This deeper reflection on the importance of Sabbath observance according to God's commands would enhance the overall understanding of the biblical principle involved."
