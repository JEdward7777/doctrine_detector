## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Israelites were instructed to gather manna for two days before the Sabbum. They were also told to keep a portion of the manna as a holy offering to be used on the Sabbum. This was done so that they could remember and celebrate the Lord's love and protection during their time in the wilderness.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response accurately explains that God instructed the Israelites to gather double manna before the Sabbath for their day of rest. It acknowledges the practical aspect of ensuring they had enough to eat. However, the response could improve by emphasizing the spiritual significance of observing the Sabbath as a command from God to rest, remember His provision, and honor Him as a holy day. This deeper reflection on the importance of Sabbath observance according to God's commands would enhance the overall understanding of the biblical principle involved.
