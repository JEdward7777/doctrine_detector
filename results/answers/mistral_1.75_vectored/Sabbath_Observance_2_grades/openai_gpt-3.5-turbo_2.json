  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands. It correctly explains that God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna in preparation for the Sabbath. The mention of the Sabbath as a day of rest and the obedience to God's commands earns a high grade. The response could be further improved by explicitly referring to the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship as commanded by God in the Bible."
