## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Israelites were instructed to gather manna for two days before the Sabbum. They were also told to keep a portion of the manna as a holy offering to be used on the Sabbum. This was done so that they could remember and celebrate the Lord's love and protection during their time in the wilderness.

Comment: The response accurately addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands. It correctly explains that God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna in preparation for the Sabbath. The mention of the Sabbath as a day of rest and the obedience to God's commands earns a high grade. The response could be further improved by explicitly referring to the Sabbath as a day of rest and worship as commanded by God in the Bible.
