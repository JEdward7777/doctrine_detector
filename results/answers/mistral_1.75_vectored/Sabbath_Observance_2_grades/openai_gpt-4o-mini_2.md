Comment: The response accurately explains that God instructed the Israelites to gather twice the amount of manna before the Sabbath so they would have enough to eat on their day of rest. It demonstrates an understanding of the importance of observing the Sabbath according to God's commands. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning the aspect of keeping a portion of the manna as a holy offering, but overall it effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview.
