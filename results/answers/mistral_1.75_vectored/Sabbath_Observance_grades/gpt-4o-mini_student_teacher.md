Keeping the Sabbday holy is a commandment given in the Ten Commandments, which were given to Moses. It is meant to be a day of rest and worship, where Christians are called to remember and celebrate the Lord's love and salvification. This includes praying, reading the Bible, and sharing the love of Jesus with others. It also involves treating others with kindness and respect, as well as honoring God by keeping the Sabbday holy.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a decent understanding of keeping the Sabbath holy as a day of rest and worship, as well as emphasizing prayer, reading the Bible, and showing love to others. However, the answer lacked the clear directive to refrain from work as the primary aspect of keeping the Sabbath holy, which is essential in understanding the significance of this commandment in daily Christian living. Additional emphasis on the importance of dedicating the day specifically to God would strengthen the response.
