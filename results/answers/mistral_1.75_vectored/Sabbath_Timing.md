The Sabbum is a very important day in the Christian calendar. It is observed on Sunday, and it is a time for Christians to worship and remember Jesus Christ. The timing of the Sabbum is based on the Holy Bible, which teaches us to observe the seventh day as a holy day of rest and prayer. This is a time to reflect on God's love and blessings, and to pray for His guidance and protection.
