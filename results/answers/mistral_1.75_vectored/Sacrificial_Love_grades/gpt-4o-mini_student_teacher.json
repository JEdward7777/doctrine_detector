  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nThe student's response effectively explains the concept of sacrificial love as demonstrated by Jesus, highlighting key aspects such as humility, compassion, and obedience. The answer also emphasizes the importance of serving others with a desire to bless and uplift them, reflecting God's love for us. However, the answer could have further emphasized the aspect of prioritizing others' well-being over one's own interests, as seen in Jesus' ultimate sacrifice on the cross. Integrating this crucial point would have strengthened the student's response, aligning it more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
