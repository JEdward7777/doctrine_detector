To love others sacrifically as demonstrated by Jesus means to love and serve others with a heart of humility, compassion, and obedience. This includes loving and serving others in the same way that Jesus loved and served His followers, even unto death. It also means loving and serving others with a desire to bless and uplift them, regardless of their background or circumstances. This kind of love is not just about giving physical gifts or doing acts of kindness, but also involves praying for and seeking to help those who are in need.
