However, there are some inaccuracies in the response. The Sadducees actually denied the concept of bodily resurrection (Matthew 22:23) and believed in a more symbolic or spiritual continuation of existence after death. It is important to clarify that the Christian belief in resurrection includes both a spiritual transformation and the resurrection of the physical body (1 Corinthians 15:42-44). The response could be improved by providing more accurate information and scriptural support."
