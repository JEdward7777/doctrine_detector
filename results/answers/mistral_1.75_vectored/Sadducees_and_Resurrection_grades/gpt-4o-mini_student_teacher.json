  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer inaccurately states that the Sadducees believed in the resurrection of the body, when in fact they did not believe in resurrection at all. The explanation provided does highlight a difference in belief between the Sadducees and Christians, but the fundamental premise is incorrect. The student demonstrated some understanding of the contrasting beliefs but failed to accurately represent the actual beliefs of the Sadducees."
