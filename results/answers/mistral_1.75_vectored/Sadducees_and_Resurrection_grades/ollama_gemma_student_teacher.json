  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately describes the Sadducees' belief in a spiritual resurrection rather than a physical resurrection. It also highlights the fundamental difference between this belief and Christian teaching, which emphasizes the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the Sadducees' understanding of the afterlife and their rejection of the resurrection as a historical event."
