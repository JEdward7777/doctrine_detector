  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of acknowledging the Sadducees' view on resurrection, specifically their belief in a spiritual resurrection. It also correctly highlights Jesus' teaching on the topic and notes the fundamental difference between the two views. However, to fully address the concern about understanding differences in beliefs and their implications for faith, the response could have explored more deeply why this difference matters for Christian theology.\n\nFor example, the response could have explained how Jesus' teaching on resurrection as a spiritual transformation is related to his teachings on salvation, justification, and sanctification. It could also have discussed how the Sadducees' view might be seen as lacking in its understanding of human nature and the purpose of creation.\n\nOverall, while the response does a good job of presenting the facts, it could benefit from more analysis and application to the concern about understanding differences in beliefs and their implications for faith."
