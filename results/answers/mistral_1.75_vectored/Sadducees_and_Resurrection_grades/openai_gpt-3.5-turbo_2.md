## [Answer](../Sadducees_and_Resurrection.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Sadducees believed in the resurrection of the body, but they also believed that it would be a spiritual resurrection. They believed that the physical body would be restored to its heavenly form, but not in the way that Jesus taught. Jesus taught that the resurrection is a spiritual transformation, where believers will receive a new life in Christ. This is a fundamental difference between the teachings of the Sadducees and Christians.
