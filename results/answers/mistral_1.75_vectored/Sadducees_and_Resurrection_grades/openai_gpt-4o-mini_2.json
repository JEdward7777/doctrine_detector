However, there is a slight oversimplification in stating that the Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection at all, when in fact, they believed in a different form of resurrection. The concern of understanding these differences in beliefs and their implications for faith is addressed somewhat effectively, but could be improved with a more nuanced understanding of the Sadducees' beliefs.
