  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some relevant points about Samson's story and the importance of keeping the Nazirite vow. However, the response focuses more on the general concept of commitment and promises rather than specifically addressing the implications of the Nazirite vow in the biblical narrative. The student could further strengthen their answer by delving deeper into the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment as it pertains to the Nazirite vow in Samson's story."
