However, while it mentions the importance of keeping promises and commitments in a general sense, it could further deepen the analysis by explicitly connecting the concept of personal commitment to fulfilling divine purposes as highlighted in biblical narratives. This would enhance the Christian worldview perspective on the relationship between divine purpose and personal commitment."
