## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The New Testament describes the sanctification process for believers in Jesus as a spiritual transformation that involves becoming more like Jesus Christ. This process begins with the Holy Spirit coming upon a person and filling them with the love of God (Acts 2:38).

The Bible teaches that believers are called to be holy and to live a life that is pleasing to God (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). This includes loving one another, forgiving others, and serving others (Matthew 22:39-40).

In addition to these teachings, the New Testament also provides specific instructions for believers on how to grow in their faith and become more like Jesus Christ. These include praying for guidance and protection, reading the Bible regularly, and seeking to serve others in love and humility (Ephesians 6:7-18).

The New Testament also emphasizes the importance of prayer and intercession for believers who are struggling with sin and temptation. Jesus taught his followers to pray for forgiveness and strength to overcome sin (Luke 12:17), and the Bible teaches that believers can pray for one another to receive strength and encouragement (James 5:16).

Overall, the New Testament teaches that the sanctification process for believers in Jesus is a lifelerning process that involves growing in love, obedience, and holiness through prayer, Bible study, and serving others.
