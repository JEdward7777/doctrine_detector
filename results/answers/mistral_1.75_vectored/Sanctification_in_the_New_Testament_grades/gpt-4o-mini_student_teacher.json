  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive overview of the sanctification process for believers in Jesus based on New Testament teachings, they focused more on the actions believers should take to grow in sanctification rather than the role of faith in the process. The answer emphasized practices such as prayer, Bible study, and serving others, but did not explicitly tie these practices back to the foundational role of faith in sanctification. \n\nTo improve the answer, the student could have highlighted the importance of faith as the foundation of sanctification, emphasizing how it is through faith that believers receive God's sanctifying work in their lives. They could have also referenced specific New Testament passages that emphasize the centrality of faith in the sanctification process.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have strengthened the connection between faith and sanctification in their response."
