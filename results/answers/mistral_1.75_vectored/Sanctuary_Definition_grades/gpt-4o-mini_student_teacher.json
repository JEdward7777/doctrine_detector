The mention of the Holy Scriptures and Jesus Christ as components of sanctuaries adds depth to the explanation; however, there is a lack of specificity in referencing the physical places like the tabernacle or temple. Strengthening the connection to these tangible structures would enhance the response's accuracy and depth."
