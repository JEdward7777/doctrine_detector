## [Answer](../Sanctuary_Definition.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, a sanctuary refers to a place of worship and protection. It is a symbol of God’s love and protection, and is meant to be a place of peace and blessing. The most important sanctuary in the Bible is the Holy Bible itself, which is referred to as the "Holy Scriptures" and the "Word of God." In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is referred to as the ultimate sanctifier and protector, who offers salvation and eternal life to all who believe in Him.
