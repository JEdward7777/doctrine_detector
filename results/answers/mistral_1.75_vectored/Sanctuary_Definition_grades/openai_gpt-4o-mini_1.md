In the Bible, a sanctuary refers to a place of worship and protection. It is a symbol of Godâ€™s love and protection, and is meant to be a place of peace and blessing. The most important sanctuary in the Bible is the Holy Bible itself, which is referred to as the "Holy Scriptures" and the "Word of God."
