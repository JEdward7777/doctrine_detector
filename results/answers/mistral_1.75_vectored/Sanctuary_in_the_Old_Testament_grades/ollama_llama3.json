  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response does a good job of recognizing the importance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God, using phrases such as \"God describes\" and \"a symbol of God's love and protection\". It also correctly identifies Jesus Christ as the ultimate sanctification and the Holy Spirit as sent to guide and protect believers. However, it could be more specific in its description of the sanctuary as a safe place for the Israelites to find protection, which is hinted at but not fully developed. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical significance of the sanctuary, but could benefit from further elaboration on its role as a source of safety and protection.\n\nNote: I compared the response to the given answer, and while it doesn't exactly mirror the language used in the answer, it does capture the essence of the idea that the sanctuary was a place where God lived among His people and provided protection. This is reflected in the 85 grade."
