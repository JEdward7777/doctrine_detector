  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response correctly addresses the concern by acknowledging that Satan and his followers will be punished in hell for eternity, consistent with Christian theology. However, it lacks depth and does not expand on the implications of Satan's fate on the struggle between good and evil in Christian theology. More elaboration and insight would strengthen the response."
