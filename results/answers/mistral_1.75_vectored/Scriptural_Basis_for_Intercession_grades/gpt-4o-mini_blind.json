  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a list of Bible verses related to praying and interceding for others, but there are several inaccuracies and inconsistencies in their references and interpretations. Some verses are misquoted or not directly related to intercession. Additionally, the student should aim for clarity and coherence in their explanations to strengthen their understanding of the practice of intercession in a biblical context. Further study and refinement are needed to improve the accuracy and relevance of their response."
