  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good selection of verses emphasizing prayer and intercession for others. However, it lacks the depth of explanation and application found in the original answer with the specified concern. Encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession could have been highlighted more effectively through a more thorough discussion of the verses provided."
