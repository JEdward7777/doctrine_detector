  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The student's response includes some relevant Bible verses, but the overall explanation lacks clarity and coherence. The student needs to focus on providing a more precise definition and explanation of propitiation within a Christian context. Additionally, some verses cited do not directly address the concept of propitiation. The student should work on improving the accuracy and depth of their biblical references and theological understanding."
