  "grade_comment": "Grade: 25/100\n\nComment: The student's answer does not directly address the concept of propitiation as requested in the question. While they mention love, sacrifice, and serving others, the focus should have been on Jesus being the propitiation for our sins. The verses provided do not relate specifically to propitiation. The student should have explicitly connected the theological concept of propitiation with the biblical references, as per the concern given."
