  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant Bible verses that connect to the theological concept of propitiation, but it could be improved in several ways to address the concern.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* The response provides multiple Bible verses that support the idea of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins.\n* The verses are mostly accurate and directly related to the topic.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* The majority of the response is repetitive and focuses on a single verse (John 13:14) repeatedly. This dilutes the impact of the other Bible verses provided.\n* There is no clear connection made between the Bible verses and the theological concept of propitiation. The respondent could have done a better job explaining how each verse contributes to our understanding of this concept.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n* Provide more concise and accurate references that directly support the concept of propitiation.\n* Make connections between the Bible verses and the theological concept, explaining how they contribute to our understanding of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins.\n* Consider using a variety of biblical genres (e.g., narrative, prophecy, letters) to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the concept."
