  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides various Bible verses discussing love, service, and sacrifice, but it lacks a direct connection to the concept of propitiation as mentioned in the initial answer. While the verses touch on related themes, they do not specifically address Jesus as the propitiation for our sins. To improve the grade, the response should include verses like 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26 to directly address the concern of connecting the theological concept of propitiation with biblical references for a deeper understanding."
