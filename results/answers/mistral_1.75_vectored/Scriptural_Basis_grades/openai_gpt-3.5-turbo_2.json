  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response does include some relevant Bible verses, it lacks depth in connecting the theological concept of propitiation with these verses. There is repetition in the verses provided, and the explanation could be more focused on how Jesus fulfills the concept of propitiation through His sacrifice for our sins. The answer could be improved by providing a more in-depth analysis and explanation of how these verses specifically relate to Jesus as the propitiation for our sins."
