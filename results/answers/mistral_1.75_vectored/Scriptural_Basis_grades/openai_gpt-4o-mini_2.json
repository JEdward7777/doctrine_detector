  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins and includes relevant Bible verses. However, there is a significant amount of repetition in the listed verses, which detracts from the overall coherence of the answer. The response could benefit from a more focused and concise selection of verses to support the theological concept of propitiation."
