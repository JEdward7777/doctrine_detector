## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible has many passages that talk about the "world" and its relationship to believers. Here are some examples:

1. John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world that He gave His most precious gift to us, that anyone who loves is a Christian."
2. John 17:14 - "I pray that you will be filled with love and joy, and that I will help you to love and serve others.
3. Ephesians 6:10 - "And pray that the Lord Jesus will give you strength and peace, that you may be filled with the Holy Spirit, and that you may love and pray for everyone, and that you may have the Holy Spirit to help you.
4. Colossians 3:10 - "And do whatever you want, as Jesus Christ our Lord wants you to do.
5. Galatians 6:10 - "Let us love one another, as Christ loves us.
6. 1 Corinthians 2:16 - "I am praying that you will always be filled with the Holy Spirit, and that you will be filled with love.
7. 1 Corinthians 13:13 - "And above all these virtues, let love be fulfilled.
8. 1 Corinthians 15:27 - "He will make everything new! He will make this new commandment: “Love the Lord your Savior.”
9. Revelation 22:1-7 - "Then I will make the water of the Holy Spirit and have the Holy Spirit come upon me. I will bless you and make you holy and give you love and make you holy. I will make you holy and make you holy. I will make you holy.

These verses show that the Bible teaches us to love and serve others, to be filled with the Holy Spirit, and to love and pray for everyone. It also teaches us to be filled with love and to make love a priority in our lives.
