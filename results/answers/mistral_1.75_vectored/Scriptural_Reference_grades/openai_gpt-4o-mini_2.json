  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides several Bible verses that emphasize the importance of love, serving others, and being filled with the Holy Spirit. However, the connection between these verses and navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values is not explicitly addressed. While the verses presented are relevant, additional explanation or application to the specific concern would strengthen the response."
