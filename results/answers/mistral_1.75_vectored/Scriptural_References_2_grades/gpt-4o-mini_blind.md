## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 30

Comment: The student provided a verse reference, which is a good start. However, the explanation provided is repetitive and unclear, making it difficult to understand the relevance to the concept of the Day of Judgment. Additionally, the content seems to be incomplete and lacks cohesiveness. More clarity, accuracy, and conciseness in linking the passage to the concept of the Day of Judgment would greatly improve the answer.
