## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer, although attempting to provide biblical references for the Day of Judgment, is severely lacking in accuracy and coherence. The student needs to refine their understanding of the biblical passages related to judgment and ensure that their responses are clear, concise, and accurately reflect the scripture.
