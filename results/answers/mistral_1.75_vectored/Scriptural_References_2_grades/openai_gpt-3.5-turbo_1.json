  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided lacks depth and coherence in addressing the concern of deepening understanding of the scriptural basis for judgment. While the student attempted to list biblical passages related to the Day of Judgment, the copied text lacks accuracy and coherence, ultimately failing to effectively reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs. The student should strive for clearer and more focused responses that directly engage with the concern presented."
