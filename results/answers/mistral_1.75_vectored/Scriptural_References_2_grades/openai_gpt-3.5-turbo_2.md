## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_2.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response did not effectively address the concern by providing a long, repetitive passage that is not relevant to the specific biblical references related to the Day of Judgment. The response lacks coherence and fails to reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs in a clear and concise manner. It is important to focus on relevant passages and provide insightful commentary to deepen understanding, which was not achieved in this response.
