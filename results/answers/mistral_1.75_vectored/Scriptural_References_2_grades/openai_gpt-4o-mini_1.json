  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided includes relevant biblical passages that reference the Day of Judgment, but the content is not entirely accurate as it seems to have been copied and pasted incorrectly. The student did not demonstrate a deepened understanding of the scripture related to judgment, and the excessive repetition in the response detracts from the coherence and clarity needed for a thorough examination of the topic. Further elaboration and explanation of the chosen passages would have been beneficial for reinforcing the scriptural basis for beliefs."
