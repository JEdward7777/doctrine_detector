## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 50

Comment: The response provided references several biblical passages related to the Day of Judgment, but unfortunately, a significant portion of the response appears to be a repetition of text from the passage in Matthew 24:37-42. This repetition does not deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment or reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs. The response would have been more effective with a concise explanation or interpretation of the referenced passages to demonstrate a clear understanding of the biblical teachings on judgment.
