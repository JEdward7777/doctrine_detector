The passage actually says, \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\" The student's response misses the mark by misquoting the passage and failing to address the specific nature of iniquity highlighted in these verses. Additionally, the interpretation provided lacks depth and theological accuracy. Further study and understanding of the passage and its implications are needed."
