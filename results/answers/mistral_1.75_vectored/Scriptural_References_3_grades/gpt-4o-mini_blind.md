## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Matthew 23:27-28 says, "I will fulfill the Lord's commandment that I am fulfilling for you. I will make you holy and help you to be holy, just as Jesus Christ is holy. I will make you holy, just as the Holy Spirit is holy." This passage teaches us that Jesus wants to make us holy and help us to be holy, just as He is holy. In order to do this, He will fulfill the Lord's commandment and make us holy through the Holy Spirit. Iniquity is sinful behavior that goes against God's commands and can lead to separation from Him. By following Jesus and being filled with the Holy Spirit, we can overcome iniquity and become more like Jesus.

Grade: 35

Comment: The student's answer does not accurately reflect the content of Matthew 23:27-28. The passage actually says, "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness." The student's response misses the mark by misquoting the passage and failing to address the specific nature of iniquity highlighted in these verses. Additionally, the interpretation provided lacks depth and theological accuracy. Further study and understanding of the passage and its implications are needed.
