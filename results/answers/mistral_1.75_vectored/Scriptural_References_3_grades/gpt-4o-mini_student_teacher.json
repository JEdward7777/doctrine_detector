  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer shows an understanding of the importance of holiness and the role of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in helping believers overcome iniquity. However, the student missed the key point of Matthew 23:27-28, which focuses on the discrepancy between outward appearances and inner righteousness. The student's answer did not directly address the concern provided, which was about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance. Overall, there is some theological insight in the student's response, but it could be improved by directly addressing the specific concern given."
