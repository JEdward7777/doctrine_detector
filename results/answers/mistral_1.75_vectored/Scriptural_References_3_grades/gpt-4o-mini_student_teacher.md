## Question [Scriptural References 3](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_3.md)
What do passages like Matthew 23:27-28 teach us about the nature of iniquity?

## Correct Answer
Matthew 23:27-28 highlights that iniquity can manifest in outward appearances versus inner righteousness, emphasizing the importance of integrity in one's faith.

## Stated Concern
This serves as a reminder for Christians to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Matthew 23:27-28 says, "I will fulfill the Lord's commandment that I am fulfilling for you. I will make you holy and help you to be holy, just as Jesus Christ is holy. I will make you holy, just as the Holy Spirit is holy." This passage teaches us that Jesus wants to make us holy and help us to be holy, just as He is holy. In order to do this, He will fulfill the Lord's commandment and make us holy through the Holy Spirit. Iniquity is sinful behavior that goes against God's commands and can lead to separation from Him. By following Jesus and being filled with the Holy Spirit, we can overcome iniquity and become more like Jesus.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student's answer shows an understanding of the importance of holiness and the role of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in helping believers overcome iniquity. However, the student missed the key point of Matthew 23:27-28, which focuses on the discrepancy between outward appearances and inner righteousness. The student's answer did not directly address the concern provided, which was about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance. Overall, there is some theological insight in the student's response, but it could be improved by directly addressing the specific concern given.
