  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately summarizes the passage and clearly defines iniquity as sinful behavior that violates God's commands. It also acknowledges the importance of following Jesus and the Holy Spirit in overcoming iniquity. However, the response would benefit from further elaboration on the connection between outward appearances and inner righteousness, as highlighted in the reference answer."
