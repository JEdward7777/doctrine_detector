## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Matthew 23:27-28 says, "I will fulfill the Lord's commandment that I am fulfilling for you. I will make you holy and help you to be holy, just as Jesus Christ is holy. I will make you holy, just as the Holy Spirit is holy." This passage teaches us that Jesus wants to make us holy and help us to be holy, just as He is holy. In order to do this, He will fulfill the Lord's commandment and make us holy through the Holy Spirit. Iniquity is sinful behavior that goes against God's commands and can lead to separation from Him. By following Jesus and being filled with the Holy Spirit, we can overcome iniquity and become more like Jesus.

**Comment:** The student's answer accurately summarizes the passage and clearly defines iniquity as sinful behavior that violates God's commands. It also acknowledges the importance of following Jesus and the Holy Spirit in overcoming iniquity. However, the response would benefit from further elaboration on the connection between outward appearances and inner righteousness, as highlighted in the reference answer.
