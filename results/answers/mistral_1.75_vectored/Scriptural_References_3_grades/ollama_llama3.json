  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern, but it falls short in fully capturing the essence of Matthew 23:27-28. While it mentions the importance of integrity, it doesn't explicitly connect this to pursuing genuine holiness. The original response focuses more on Jesus' desire to make us holy and fulfill God's commandment, which is an important aspect of the passage. However, it could have delved deeper into the contrast between outward appearances and inner righteousness, as highlighted in the given answer. To better align with the concern and the given answer, the response could have emphasized that true holiness requires a transformation from the inside out, rather than just conforming to external standards."
