## Question [Scriptural References 3](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_3.md)
What do passages like Matthew 23:27-28 teach us about the nature of iniquity?

## Correct Answer
Matthew 23:27-28 highlights that iniquity can manifest in outward appearances versus inner righteousness, emphasizing the importance of integrity in one's faith.

## Stated Concern
This serves as a reminder for Christians to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Matthew 23:27-28 says, "I will fulfill the Lord's commandment that I am fulfilling for you. I will make you holy and help you to be holy, just as Jesus Christ is holy. I will make you holy, just as the Holy Spirit is holy." This passage teaches us that Jesus wants to make us holy and help us to be holy, just as He is holy. In order to do this, He will fulfill the Lord's commandment and make us holy through the Holy Spirit. Iniquity is sinful behavior that goes against God's commands and can lead to separation from Him. By following Jesus and being filled with the Holy Spirit, we can overcome iniquity and become more like Jesus.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response partially addresses the concern, but it falls short in fully capturing the essence of Matthew 23:27-28. While it mentions the importance of integrity, it doesn't explicitly connect this to pursuing genuine holiness. The original response focuses more on Jesus' desire to make us holy and fulfill God's commandment, which is an important aspect of the passage. However, it could have delved deeper into the contrast between outward appearances and inner righteousness, as highlighted in the given answer. To better align with the concern and the given answer, the response could have emphasized that true holiness requires a transformation from the inside out, rather than just conforming to external standards.
