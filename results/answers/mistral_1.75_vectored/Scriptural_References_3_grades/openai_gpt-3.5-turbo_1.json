The mention of following Jesus and being filled with the Holy Spirit to overcome iniquity aligns well with the concern of pursuing genuine holiness. The perspective is consistent with a Christian worldview, although some further elaboration on the role of Jesus's sacrifice in overcoming iniquity could have strengthened the response."
