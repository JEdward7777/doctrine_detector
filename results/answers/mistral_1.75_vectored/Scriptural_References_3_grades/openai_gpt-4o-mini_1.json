However, the submission could have included a stronger emphasis on the transformational work of Jesus through the Holy Spirit in enabling believers to pursue genuine holiness, rather than just focusing on external compliance. Incorporating more discussion on the role of Christ in sanctification would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
