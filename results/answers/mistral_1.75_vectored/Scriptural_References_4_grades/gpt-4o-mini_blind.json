It correctly emphasizes the spiritual aspect of the birthright as a blessing from God rather than just a physical inheritance. To improve, the response could delve deeper into the theological implications of the birthright concept in each verse, relating it to broader Christian doctrines such as salvation, sonship in Christ, and the importance of spiritual inheritance. Additionally, providing more specific scriptural analysis and connections would enhance the depth of understanding."
