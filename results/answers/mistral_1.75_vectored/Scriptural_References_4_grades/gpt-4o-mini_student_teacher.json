  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good understanding of the significance of birthright in Biblical teachings, emphasizing blessings from God. The student effectively connects the passages to Jesus as the true fulfillment of the birthright promise and highlights the spiritual aspect of the birthright. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the themes of holiness and consequences as outlined in the reference answer. Overall, a solid response that demonstrates a good grasp of the topic."
