10.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 10

Comment: The student provided the correct reference (Matthew 25:46) but the content of their answer is incomplete and unclear due to repeated text. There is a lack of explanation or analysis connecting the verse to the concept of Hades transitioning from a neutral place to a location associated with the unrighteous. Additionally, there are formatting issues that hinder the coherence of the response. Further elaboration and clarity are needed for a higher grade.
