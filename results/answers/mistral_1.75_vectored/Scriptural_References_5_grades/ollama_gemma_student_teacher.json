  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 70/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* The student correctly identifies several New Testament verses that indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades.\n* The student provides detailed annotations for each verse, explaining how it contributes to the shift in understanding.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The student's answer lacks broader theological context, focusing primarily on individual verses rather than exploring the overall development of eschatology in the New Testament.\n* The student's answer does not engage with the provided concern about expanding knowledge of scriptural evidence and its implications for Christian eschatology.\n\n\n**Areas for improvement:**\n\n* The student could benefit from including more analysis of the broader context of the verses they cited, including the political and cultural environment of the time.\n* The student could also explore the development of eschatology in different Christian traditions and how their understanding of Hades has evolved over time."
