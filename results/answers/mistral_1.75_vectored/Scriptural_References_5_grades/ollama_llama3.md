20.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 20.

The primary issue with this response is that it appears to be intentionally sabotaging its own attempt at providing relevant scripture by copying and pasting an excessive amount of repetitive text from Matthew 25:46-47, which does not address the shift in understanding of Hades. The passage provided as the answer (Luke 16:23 and Luke 23:43) is correct, but it seems to be ignored in favor of a lengthy and irrelevant section.

In terms of expanding knowledge of scriptural evidence regarding the nature of Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology, this response falls short. The provided information does not contribute meaningfully to our understanding of these topics.

To improve this response, the author should focus on providing relevant and accurate scriptural evidence that supports their claims, rather than including unnecessary or misleading content.
