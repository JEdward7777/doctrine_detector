## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1.md)

Comment: The response provided a relevant example from Luke but failed to address the concern effectively by including a lengthy passage from Matthew that did not add value to the discussion of expanding knowledge on Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology. The response lacked depth and coherence in connecting additional New Testament verses to support the shift in understanding of Hades.
