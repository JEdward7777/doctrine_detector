  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided contains extensive repetition of a passage from the New Testament, which is not directly relevant to the concern at hand. The student failed to address the concern effectively by not demonstrating a deeper understanding of the scriptural evidence concerning the changing perception of Hades and its significance in Christian eschatology. The excessive repetition detracts from the overall coherence and relevance of the response."
