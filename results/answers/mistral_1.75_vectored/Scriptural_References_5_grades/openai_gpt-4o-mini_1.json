  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response includes relevant Biblical verses that support the understanding of a shift in the concept of Hades, specifically focusing on the fate of the righteous and unrighteous. However, the excessive repetition of a single verse from Matthew detracts significantly from the overall coherence and quality of the response. This repetition dilutes the effectiveness of the argument and detracts from the clarity of the explanation. Focusing on expanding the analysis with a variety of verses and providing a more concise and focused discussion would greatly enhance the response."
