  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response provided is not directly related to the concern raised. The student failed to provide a relevant analysis of the scriptural evidence regarding the nature of Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology. The excessive repetition in the New Testament verses provided also detracts from the quality of the response. In future, the student should focus on addressing the specific concern given to ensure a more accurate and comprehensive answer."
