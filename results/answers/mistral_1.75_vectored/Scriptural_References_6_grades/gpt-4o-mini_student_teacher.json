  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 30. \n\nThe student's answer does not address the specific biblical passages that provide insight into the characteristics of fools and foolish behavior as requested in the question. The verses provided by the student are unrelated to the topic of fools and foolish behavior, focusing instead on themes of love, prayer, and guidance. The student's response lacks depth and relevance to the assigned topic, earning a low grade. The student should focus on directly addressing the question with appropriate biblical references in the future."
