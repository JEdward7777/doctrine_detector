While the passage examples do provide some insights into wise and righteous living, they are not directly connected to the concern. Additionally, the majority of the response focuses on explaining individual verses rather than drawing connections between them or applying them to real-life situations.\n\nTo improve, the response could have provided more specific examples of how the passages address foolishness in one's own life, such as offering practical advice for avoiding foolish decisions or providing encouragement for seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit."
