  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student has a good understanding of the concept of humility and service in relation to exaltation in the Christian faith as presented in the verses from 1 Peter and Philippians. However, the answer could be more in-depth and provide deeper theological insights into the exaltation of Christ as demonstrated in these passages. Additionally, incorporating more specific references to the verses and directly tying them to the concept of exaltation would enhance the overall discussion."
