  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response effectively discusses the importance of humility and serving others in Christian faith, but there is a lack of depth in connecting the verses specifically to the concept of exaltation as requested. The answer would have been stronger if it directly addressed how the verses demonstrate exaltation, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
