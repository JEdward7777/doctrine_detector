The writer correctly identifies that 1 Peter 5:5-7 encourages humility and states that God exalts the humble, and that Philippians 2:9-11 highlights that God exalted Jesus above all names. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more detail about how these principles apply to believers' lives."
