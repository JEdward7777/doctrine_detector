  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the biblical principles of humility and exaltation in the life of believers through the interpretation of 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11. It accurately captures the essence of serving others and putting humility into practice as key components of exaltation in the Christian faith. The only improvement would be to provide more specific examples or practical applications of how believers can live out these principles in their daily lives."
