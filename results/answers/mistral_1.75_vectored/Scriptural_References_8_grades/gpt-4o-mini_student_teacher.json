  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good effort in providing scriptural references supporting the concept of being blameless, but their chosen verses do not directly address the concept of blamelessness. The verses provided by the student focus more on obedience, love, and being filled with the Holy Spirit, which are important aspects but do not directly align with the concept of being blameless. Encouragement to further explore and select verses that specifically talk about being blameless would have improved the response."
