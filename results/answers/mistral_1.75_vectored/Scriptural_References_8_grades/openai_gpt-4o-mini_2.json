However, the response could have been improved by directly incorporating the key references provided in the given answer (1 Thessalonians 2:10, 2 Peter 3:14, and Philippians 2:15) to further strengthen the argument. Additionally, more explanation and analysis on how these verses guide Christians towards living a blameless life would have been beneficial."
