Comment: The student correctly identified the book of Genesis as containing the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham. However, the student provided an incorrect verse reference by stating Genesis 17:7 instead of Genesis 17:1. Overall, the answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical reference but lacks precision.
