## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 80/100**

**Comment:**

The student's answer is largely correct, but it contains some inaccuracies. While it is true that the book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham (Genesis 17:1), the reference to Jesus Christ as "Almighty" in Genesis 17:7 is not supported by the text. Additionally, the student's answer includes an irrelevant statement about other verses in the Bible containing the term "Almighty." While some other verses may indeed use this title for God, it is not relevant to the specific question.
