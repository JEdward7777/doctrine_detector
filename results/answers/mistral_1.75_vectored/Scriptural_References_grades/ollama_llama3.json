Specifically, Genesis 17:1 refers to God as the \"Almighty\" (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05d3\u05b7\u05d9 El Shaddai), not Jesus Christ. The concern about knowing biblical references is also somewhat missed, as the response only provides a single reference without much reflection on its significance or relevance to one's connection with Scripture and God's promises.\n\nTo improve, the response could have provided more context and insight into why this title is significant in Genesis 17:1 and how it relates to our connection with God."
