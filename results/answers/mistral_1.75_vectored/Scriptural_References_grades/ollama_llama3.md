## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The response gets some points for mentioning the correct book (Genesis) and chapter (17), but it falls short in its understanding of God's title as "Almighty". Specifically, Genesis 17:1 refers to God as the "Almighty" (Hebrew: שַׁדַי El Shaddai), not Jesus Christ. The concern about knowing biblical references is also somewhat missed, as the response only provides a single reference without much reflection on its significance or relevance to one's connection with Scripture and God's promises.

To improve, the response could have provided more context and insight into why this title is significant in Genesis 17:1 and how it relates to our connection with God.
