  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided an accurate biblical reference to God being called 'Almighty' in Genesis 17:1. However, the original response inaccurately referenced Jesus Christ as 'Almighty' in Genesis 17:7, which is incorrect. Knowing and accurately citing biblical references is important for a deeper understanding of Scripture and God's promises, hence the importance of providing correct references. Improving the accuracy of references will lead to a better grade in the future."
