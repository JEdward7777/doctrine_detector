Grade: 60

Comment: The original response is partially correct in identifying the reference to God as 'Almighty' in Genesis, but the student's response incorrectly states the verse number. While the student's response shows some understanding of the biblical concept, more accuracy is needed in citing specific verses for a higher grade. It is important to pay attention to details when referencing biblical texts to accurately convey God's Word.
