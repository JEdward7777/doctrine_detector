  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: While the student attempted to provide Bible verses emphasizing the theme of restoration, their answers appear to be a blend of inaccurate paraphrasing and misinterpreted scripture. It is crucial to accurately quote and interpret verses when discussing biblical themes. Additionally, some statements do not align with Christian doctrine or Biblical teachings. The student could benefit from a deeper understanding of the verses and seeking to convey the true message of restoration found in the Bible."
