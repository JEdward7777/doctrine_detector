The Bible has many verses that emphasize the theme of restoration. Here are some examples:

1. Isaiah 63:9-10 (NIV): "I will always be with you, and I will restore you and make you holy. I will overpower all who permeate me with love and prayers and have a desire to be like Jesus. I will give you a new heart in response to my commandments, and I will enable you to love me more deeply.

2. Jeremiah 3:17 (NIV): "I will restore you to your holy name, and I will be loving and merciful. I will be humble and meek, and I will be obedient to the Lord. I will be a servant to the Lord, and I will be a servant to others.

3. Matthew 16:19 (NVI): "And I will give you a new commandment, that whoever loves me will also love me, and I will love you. And I will come to you to fulfill this commandment.

4. Acts 3:16 (NIV): "Jesus is the Holy Spirit, sent to help you and make you holy. He is the Lord.

5. Galatians 6:10 (NIV): "Let us pray for one another, and love one another, and do this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

These verses emphasize the importance of restoration and show how it can bring peace and joy to those who receive it. They also remind us to love and serve others as Jesus did.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student showed effort in providing Bible verses that touch on the concept of restoration, but the verses they cited do not accurately address the concern of finding scriptural support for restoration in one's faith journey. They should focus on selecting verses that specifically emphasize God's promise of restoration and renewal in a believer's life, like Acts 3:21 and Isaiah 49:5-6.
