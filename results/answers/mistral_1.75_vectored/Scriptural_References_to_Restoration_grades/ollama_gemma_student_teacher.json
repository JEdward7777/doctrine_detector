  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is well-organized and provides relevant biblical references to support the theme of restoration. However, it would benefit from a deeper analysis of the verses selected, particularly in relation to the concern of finding scriptural support for the concept of restoration in one's faith journey. The student's conclusion could also be strengthened by connecting the verses to the broader context of Christian theology and practice."
