The Bible has many verses that emphasize the theme of restoration. Here are some examples:

1. Isaiah 63:9-10 (NIV): "I will always be with you, and I will restore you and make you holy. I will overpower all who permeate me with love and prayers and have a desire to be like Jesus. I will give you a new heart in response to my commandments, and I will enable you to love me more deeply.

2. Jeremiah 3:17 (NIV): "I will restore you to your holy name, and I will be loving and merciful. I will be humble and meek, and I will be obedient to the Lord. I will be a servant to the Lord, and I will be a servant to others.

3. Matthew 16:19 (NVI): "And I will give you a new commandment, that whoever loves me will also love me, and I will love you. And I will come to you to fulfill this commandment.

4. Acts 3:16 (NIV): "Jesus is the Holy Spirit, sent to help you and make you holy. He is the Lord.

5. Galatians 6:10 (NIV): "Let us pray for one another, and love one another, and do this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
