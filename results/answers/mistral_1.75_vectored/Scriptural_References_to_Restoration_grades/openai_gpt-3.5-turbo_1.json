However, there are inconsistencies in accurately citing and interpreting the verses, such as misquoting or adding to the content of the verses. These inaccuracies diminish the overall reliability and credibility of the response. It's important to ensure accurate representation of Scripture to maintain the integrity of the message being conveyed."
