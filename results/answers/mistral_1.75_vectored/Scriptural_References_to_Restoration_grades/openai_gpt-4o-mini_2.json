  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided does quote specific verses that emphasize restoration, showing a good understanding of the concept within a Christian worldview. However, the response also includes some misinterpreted and incorrectly paraphrased verses that deviate from the original biblical texts. Overall, while the response demonstrates familiarity with the theme of restoration in the Bible, there are inaccuracies in the quoted verses that lower the grade."
