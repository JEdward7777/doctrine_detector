The student correctly identifies the symbolic representation of the Son of Man as Jesus Christ and emphasizes the themes of salvation, service, love, and faith. However, the response could be strengthened by further explaining the doctrinal implications of Jesus' second coming, such as judgment, resurrection of the dead, and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom. Additionally, a more in-depth exploration of the need for repentance and readiness for Christ's return, as emphasized in the New Testament, would enhance the theological depth of the answer."
