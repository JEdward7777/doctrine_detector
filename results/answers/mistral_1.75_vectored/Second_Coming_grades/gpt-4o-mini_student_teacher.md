Grade: 70

Comment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of Jesus' statement about the Son of Man coming back on the clouds, emphasizing hope, love, and the call to live in faith and obedience. However, the student's answer slightly misses the specific Christian worldview perspective by not directly connecting Jesus' return as the Messiah to His ultimate authority and the fulfillment of God's promises as the reference answer does. Integrating this theological aspect would strengthen the student's response in alignment with the Christian worldview.
