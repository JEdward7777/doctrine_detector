It emphasizes the promise of Jesus' return as the Messiah, affirming hope in His ultimate authority and the fulfillment of God's promises. The response also elaborates on the symbolic significance of the Son of Man in representing Jesus Christ's mission and teachings. However, to enhance the depth of analysis, more specific references to Christian eschatological beliefs and scriptural foundations could be included. Overall, a solid and well-rounded response."
