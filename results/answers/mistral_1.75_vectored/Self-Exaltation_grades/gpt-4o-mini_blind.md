## [Answer](../Self-Exaltation.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that we should humble ourselves and love one another, and that we should not exalt ourselves. Here are some specific verses that emphasize this:

1 Corinthians 2:7-8 says, "Let us pray that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit, that we may have a spirit of love and obedience, and that we may be fruitful and always make good deeds, so that we may fulfill the commandment of our Lord Jesus Christ.

2 Corinthians 6:3 says, "I am humbly entrusted to you a command that is very important. If anyone has a new hope in Christ Jesus, let him or she also serve others.

Ephesians 4:10 says, "And I will always pray that you will be filled with the Holy Spirit and will be able to help me to fulfill my mission to share the love of Jesus Christ to everyone who is a Christian.

Galatians 6:9 says, "Let us not become wise in the eyes of our Lord Jesus Christ. Let us always remember that we have received a great blessing if we have a new hope in Jesus Christ.

James 4:10 says, "Humble yourselves, my beloved brothers and sisters, and let us pray that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit.

These verses remind us that we are called to serve others and to love one another, and that we should never exalt ourselves above others. We are called to be humble and to serve others, and to always remember that we have been blessed by God.
