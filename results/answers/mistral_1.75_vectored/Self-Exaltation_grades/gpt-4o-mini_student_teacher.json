  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer provides relevant Bible verses emphasizing humility and serving others, which is commendable. However, there is a lack of direct addressing of the concern about recognizing and avoiding the sin of pride. The student should have incorporated more discussion on how exalting oneself leads to pride, arrogance, and separation from God, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the response shows a good understanding of biblical teachings on humility, but falls short in directly addressing the concern raised."
