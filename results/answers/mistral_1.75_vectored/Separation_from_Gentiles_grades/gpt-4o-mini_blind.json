The Pharisees were not a Christian group following the teachings of Jesus Christ as Christianity had not yet been established during their time. The Pharisees were a Jewish sect focusing on strict adherence to Mosaic law and tradition. Their concern about separating Jewish people from Gentiles stemmed from their interpretation of purity laws and fear of ritual contamination rather than a desire to follow Jesus' teachings. The response fails to reflect an accurate understanding of the Pharisees' motives and religious context."
