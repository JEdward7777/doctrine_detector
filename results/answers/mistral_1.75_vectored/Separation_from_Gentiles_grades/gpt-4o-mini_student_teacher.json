It is important to recognize that the Pharisees were a Jewish sect who followed Jewish laws and traditions, not Christian teachings. The answer also misses the key point that the Pharisees were primarily concerned with maintaining religious purity and adherence to Jewish laws, rather than protecting their faith as Christians."
