It highlights the Pharisees' commitment to upholding their faith in a diverse cultural context, which aligns well with a Christian-specific worldview that values religious fidelity and adherence to divine commandments. The response could be strengthened by explicitly tying this concern back to the broader Christian context and emphasizing the Pharisees' role within Judaism rather than as a Christian group."
