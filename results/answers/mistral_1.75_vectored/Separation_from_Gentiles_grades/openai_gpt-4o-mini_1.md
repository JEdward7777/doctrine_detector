The Pharisees were a Christian group who wanted to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. They believed that it was important to separate themselves from the Gentiles, who were not part of the Christian community.

Comment: The response accurately addresses the concern provided by highlighting the Pharisees' motivation to maintain religious purity and uphold Jewish laws and traditions in the face of cultural diversity. However, the term "Christian group" is inaccurate as the Pharisees were actually a Jewish sect, not a Christian group. The answer would benefit from a more precise understanding of the historical context.
