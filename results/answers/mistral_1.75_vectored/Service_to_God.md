The text provides several ways that Christians can serve God in their ministry. Here are some of them:

1. Praying and praying again: Jesus teaches us to pray and pray again, to pray for those who persecute you, to pray for those who love you, and to pray for those who have a special need.

2. Serving others: Jesus tells us to serve others as He served Him, to love one another as He loves us, and to do unto others as He would do unto you.

3. Sharing the Gospel: Jesus commands us to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Holy Spirit, and of Jesus Christ.

4. Loving and caring for the sick and the poor: Jesus tells us to love and care for those who are sick and those who are poor, and to remember that we are also commanded to love and care for those who are persecuted and those who are persecuted because of His commandments.

5. Speaking the truth and speaking in love: Jesus tells us to speak the truth and to speak in love, to forgive anyone who has wronged you, and to forgive anyone who has wronged you in the same way that Jesus forgives you.

6. Finding joy in serving others: Jesus tells us to rejoice and be glad, and to rejoice and be glad, even if you are persecuted for doing so.

7. Following Jesus' example: Jesus is our ultimate example of how we should serve God in our ministry. He came to serve and to love, and He wants us to do the same.
