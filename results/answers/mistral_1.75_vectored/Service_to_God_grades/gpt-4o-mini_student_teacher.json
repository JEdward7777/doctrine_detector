  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response covers various ways Christians can serve God in their ministry, such as praying, serving others, sharing the Gospel, caring for the sick and poor, speaking the truth in love, finding joy in serving, and following Jesus' example. However, the response lacks specificity and actionable steps that align closely with the concern of clarifying actionable ways to engage in ministry. The teacher's reference answer, on the other hand, specifically mentions teaching about God, caring for the sick, providing for the poor, and fulfilling ministry roles. Encouraging the student to provide more concrete and practical examples of serving God in ministry would enhance their response."
