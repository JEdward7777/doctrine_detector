  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nWhile the student's answer is insightful and demonstrates an understanding of the biblical context, it lacks precision in its reference to Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. The focus of the Genesis covenant is God's promise not to destroy the earth, which is adequately conveyed in the reference answer."
