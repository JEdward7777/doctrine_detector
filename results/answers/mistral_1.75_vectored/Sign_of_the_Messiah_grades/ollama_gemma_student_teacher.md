## [Answer](../Sign_of_the_Messiah.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The sign given to the shepherds in Luke 2:10-12 is a fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecy in Isaiah 68:23-24. It says, "And a light will be upon me, and I will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and will be obedient to God. And I will be blessed and will be a blessing. And I will be sent to you to be a blessing and will be a blessing to you. And I will be sent to you to be a blessing and will be a blessing to you." This sign was meant to bring peace and joy to all who would receive it, and it is a reminder that Jesus came to bring salvation and blessings to all people.
