Anointing was a significant act in the Old Testament that had various meanings and applications. It was used to symbolize and fulfill specific roles and responsibilities for those who were chosen by God to serve Him. Here are some of the ways anointing was used in the Old Testament:

1. Priests: The Bible says, "And he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, and will be sent to you to be a servant and a blessing to you to be a servant to the Lord. (Acts 2:46). In the Old Testament, anointing was used to consecrate and sanctify the priests to serve as a holy servant to the Lord. This was done through the use of oil, which was applied to the head and hands of the priest.

2. Kings: The Bible says, "And I will anoint him and fill him with the Holy Spirit, and he will be sent to be a servant and a blessing to you to be a servant to the Lord. (Acts 2:46). In the Old Testament, anointing was also used to consecrate and sanctify the kings to serve as a servant to the Lord. This was done through the use of oil, which was applied to the head and hands of the king.

3. Prophets: The Bible says, "And I will send a servant before me to prepare his way, and he will be persecuted and will be blessed and will be persecuted, and will be sent to be a servant and a blessing to you to be a servant to the Lord. (Acts 2:46). In the Old Testament, anointing was also used to consecrate and sanctify the prophets to serve as a servant to the Lord. This was done through the use of oil, which was applied to the head and hands of the prophet.

In all these cases, anointing was a symbol of God's love and protection, and it was a reminder of the special calling and purpose that God had for each person who was anointed. It was also a way to bless and blessings to others, to be a servant to the Lord, and to be a blessing to His people.
