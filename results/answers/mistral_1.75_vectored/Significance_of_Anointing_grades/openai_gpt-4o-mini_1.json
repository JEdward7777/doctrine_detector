  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of how anointing was used in the Old Testament to set apart priests, kings, and prophets for special service to God. The submission effectively explains how anointing symbolized empowerment and consecration for their roles. However, the inclusion of relevant Bible verses and further elaboration on the significance of anointing in biblical leadership roles would have enhanced the depth and clarity of the response."
