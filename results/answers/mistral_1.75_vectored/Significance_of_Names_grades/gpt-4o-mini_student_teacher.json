  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's response contains some elements of truth regarding the significance of \"Shaddai\" as a title, particularly in relation to Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament promises. However, the student missed the core emphasis of the question in deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. The student could have further elaborated on how translating \"Shaddai\" as a title emphasizes God's attributes of omnipotence and strength, as highlighted in the reference answer by the teacher."
