## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
"Shaddai" is a Hebrew name that is often used to refer to God in the Bible. It is significant that it is often translated as a title rather than a name because it emphasizes the importance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the promises made in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the Messiah and the Son of God, who came to fulfill the promises made in the Old Testament. By using "Shaddai" as a title, the Bible emphasizes the importance of Jesus as the fulfillment of those promises.
