  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title rather than a name in Bible translations. The student correctly points out that this emphasis highlights the importance of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of the promises made in the Old Testament. However, the answer could be strengthened by further elaborating on the attributes of God that are emphasized by using \"Shaddai\" as a title."
