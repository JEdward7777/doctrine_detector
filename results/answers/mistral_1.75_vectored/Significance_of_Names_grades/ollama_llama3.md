## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

## Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

"Shaddai" is a Hebrew name that is often used to refer to God in the Bible. It is significant that it is often translated as a title rather than a name because it emphasizes the importance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the promises made in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the Messiah and the Son of God, who came to fulfill the promises made in the Old Testament. By using "Shaddai" as a title, the Bible emphasizes the importance of Jesus as the fulfillment of those promises.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a score of 60.

While the response does mention God's character and attributes, it doesn't quite align with the concern of deepening our understanding of God's relational aspect in the Christian faith. The concern specifically asks for a deeper understanding of God's character and relational aspect, but the response focuses more on God's attributes (omnipotence and strength) rather than His relational nature.

The response also fails to address how using "Shaddai" as a title or name affects our understanding of God's relationship with humanity. It only mentions that it emphasizes Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament promises, which is not directly related to the concern.

To improve this response, I would suggest exploring how God's character and relational aspect are revealed through His names and titles, including "Shaddai". The writer could also delve deeper into how this relates to our personal relationship with God and how it shapes our understanding of God's nature as a relational being.
