However, it could have further deepened the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith by incorporating more references to scripture or theological teachings that highlight the personal relationship believers can have with God through Jesus Christ. More integration of Christian teachings on God's relational aspect would have greatly enhanced the response."
