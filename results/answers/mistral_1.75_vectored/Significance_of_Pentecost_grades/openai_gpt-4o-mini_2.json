It addresses the concern by highlighting the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering believers for ministry and fulfilling Jesus' promise. Additionally, it captures the essence of the event as described in Acts 2 and how it marked the beginning of the Christian Church's mission. Overall, a strong response from a Christian worldview perspective."
