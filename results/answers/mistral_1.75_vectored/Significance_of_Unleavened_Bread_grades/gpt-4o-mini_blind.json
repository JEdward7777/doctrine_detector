The student correctly connects unleavened bread to Jesus as the \"Bread of Life\" and its significance in the Holy Communion. However, there are some theological inaccuracies, such as referring to Jesus as the \"Lamb of Christ\" instead of the \"Lamb of God.\" The connection between unleavened bread and seeking forgiveness could be further emphasized, and the mention of humility and service is a good addition. Overall, a strong understanding but some minor doctrinal errors to address."
