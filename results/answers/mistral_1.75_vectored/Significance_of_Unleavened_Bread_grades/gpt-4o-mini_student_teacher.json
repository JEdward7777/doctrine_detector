  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 60. \n\nWhile the student correctly identifies the symbolism of Jesus as the \"Bread of Life\" and the association of unleavened bread with the Passover and Holy Communion, their response lacks depth in explaining the direct correlation between unleavened bread and the removal of sin from a person's life. The student's answer focuses more on general teachings of Jesus and the significance of unleavened bread in Christian practices, but it does not effectively address the specific concern of understanding the spiritual significance of unleavened bread in relation to sin and living a life that honors God. \n\nThe student's answer would benefit from a more detailed theological explanation of how unleavened bread symbolizes the removal of sin and the importance of living a life that is pleasing to God, based on Christian teachings and scripture."
