However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness as it inaccurately suggests that Jesus was sent to fulfill his mission under their protection and guidance. In a Christian worldview, Jesus' mission and ministry were ultimately ordained by God the Father, and Jesus did not rely on worldly rulers for protection or guidance in fulfilling his divine purpose. Additionally, the answer could have provided more historical context about the specific role and limitations of a Tetrarch in governance during that time."
