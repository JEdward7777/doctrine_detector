  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the role of signs and miracles in the ministry of Jesus and the apostles, emphasizing their demonstration of love, compassion, and power. The response effectively links these miracles to the teachings of Jesus and the encouragement for followers to act in love and service. However, the student could strengthen their answer by explicitly connecting these signs and miracles to the validation of God's power and authority, as outlined in the reference answer."
