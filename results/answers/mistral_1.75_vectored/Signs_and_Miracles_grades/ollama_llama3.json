  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of highlighting the significance of signs and miracles in the ministry of Jesus and his apostles, emphasizing their role in demonstrating God's love, compassion, and power. The text also effectively illustrates how these events helped to spread the message of salvation and encouraged people to follow Jesus.\n\nHowever, there is some room for improvement. While the response does touch on the theme of faith, it would benefit from a more explicit exploration of the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. The answer provided as the correct solution does ask us to examine this very relationship, but the response could go further in developing this idea.\n\nFor example, one might explore how Jesus' miracles and teachings required faith on the part of his listeners, or how the apostles' performances of miracles were a demonstration of their own faithfulness. A more detailed discussion of these topics would strengthen the response and bring it closer to the ideal score.\n\nOverall, though, this is a strong response that effectively engages with the concern and provides insightful commentary on the role of signs and miracles in Christian ministry."
