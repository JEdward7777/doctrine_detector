  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern of examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation within a Christian worldview. It thoroughly discusses how signs and miracles validate God's power and authority, demonstrating the truth of Jesus and the apostles delivering God's message. The explanation provided is coherent and supported by relevant examples from the Bible. However, to enhance the response further, it could incorporate more explicit references to specific biblical passages that illustrate the interconnectedness of faith, signs, and God's revelation in a more focused manner."
