It addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of faith in relation to signs and God's revelation. The explanation is clear and aligns well with a Christian worldview, highlighting the significance of miracles in affirming the truth of God's message. However, a deeper exploration of the specific dynamics between faith, signs, and revelation could further enhance the response."
