  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: This answer provides a basic understanding of the term \"Son of God\" in relation to Jesus. The student mentions Jesus' divine identity and mission to save humanity, which is good. However, there are some doctrinal inaccuracies and unclear statements in the response. The explanation could have been more thorough and grounded in biblical theology. Additionally, the phrase \"he is Jesus Christ, the Son of Jesus Christ, and the Son of God\" is unclear and may lead to confusion. More clarity and depth in connecting Jesus as the Son of God within the Trinity would strengthen the answer."
