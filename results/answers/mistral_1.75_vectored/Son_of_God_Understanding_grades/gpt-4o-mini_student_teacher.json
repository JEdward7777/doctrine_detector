  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides some understanding of the term \"Son of God\" but lacks a clear explanation of Jesus' divinity and eternal relationship with God the Father. The answer touches on Jesus' divine identity but does not clearly articulate that Jesus is fully God and shares the same nature as God the Father. The student should further develop their explanation to align more closely with the Christian belief in the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God."
