  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a clear explanation of the distinction between the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus and the term 'sons of God' used for believers. They correctly point out that the title 'Son of God' is specifically attributed to Jesus Christ as God's unique Son, while 'sons of God' encompasses all believers in Christ. The student's response effectively addresses the concern of clarity in theological discussions. However, the teacher's reference answer is more concise and to the point, hence the slight deduction in the grade. Overall, a solid understanding and explanation of the distinction were demonstrated."
