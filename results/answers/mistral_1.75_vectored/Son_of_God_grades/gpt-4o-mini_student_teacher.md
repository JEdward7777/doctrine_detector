## [Answer](../Son_of_God.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The title 'Son of God' is a specific reference to Jesus Christ, who is considered the Son of God and the Son of the Holy Spirit. This title is used in the Bible to affirm Jesus' divine nature and his relationship with God. It is also used to emphasize Jesus' unique role in salvation and his mission to save humanity.

It is also used to encourage believers to pray for one another and to support each other in their Christian walk.
