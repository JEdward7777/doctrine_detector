  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer clearly distinguishes between the title 'Son of God' and the term 'sons of God' from a Christian perspective. It accurately explains that the former refers specifically to Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Son of the Holy Spirit, while the latter refers to all believers in Christ. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of theological concepts and demonstrates excellent clarity in presenting the distinction."
