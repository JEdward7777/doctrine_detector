  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the response a score of 90.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" specifically referring to Jesus Christ, and the phrase \"sons of God\" referring broadly to all believers in Christ. This aligns well with the given answer, and the concern that clarity on this distinction helps avoid confusion in theological discussions is well-addressed.\n\nOne area for improvement could be a more detailed explanation of why this distinction is important, beyond simply stating that it helps avoid confusion. However, overall the response provides a clear and accurate summary of the distinction between these two phrases, making it a strong 90."
