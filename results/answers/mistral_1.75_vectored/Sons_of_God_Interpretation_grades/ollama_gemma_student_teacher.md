## [Answer](../Sons_of_God_Interpretation.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The term "sons of God" is used several times in the Bible, but its meaning can vary depending on the context. In the book of Genesis, there are two instances where this phrase is used:

1. In Genesis 6:7, Jesus Christ is referred to as a Son of God. This verse says, "And I will make you holy and will be with you always." This passage emphasizes the importance of being a son of God and how Jesus Christ is an example of what it means to be a son of God.

2. In Genesis 6:4-8, the Bible talks about the story of Noah and his family. In this passage, the Bible refers to Noah and his family as "sons of God." This passage emphasizes that they were chosen by God to be saved from the judgment that was coming upon the earth.

In both cases, the term "sons of God" is used to refer to those who are loved and cherished by God. It is also used to emphasize the importance of following Jesus Christ and living a life that is pleasing to God.
