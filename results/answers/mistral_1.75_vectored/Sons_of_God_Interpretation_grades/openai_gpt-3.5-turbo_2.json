However, the answer lacks a strong grounding in a specific Christian worldview perspective and does not directly engage with how biblical interpretation aids in understanding the meaning of scripture passages. Additionally, the response could benefit from providing more clarity and depth in explaining the significance of this term within a Christian understanding."
