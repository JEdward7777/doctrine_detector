  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-written and informative response that demonstrates a good understanding of the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. However, the student's answer lacks a direct reference to a specific Biblical verse, such as Ephesians 6:12, which the teacher provided as a reference. Connecting the explanation to a specific verse would strengthen the argument and align the response more closely with a Christian worldview perspective."
