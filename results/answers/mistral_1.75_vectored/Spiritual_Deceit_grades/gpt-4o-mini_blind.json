  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student correctly highlights the biblical teachings about idolatry and the importance of putting God above all else. However, the response lacks clarity and depth in explaining the specific role demons play in the deception of idolatry according to Christian doctrine. To improve the grade, the student could provide more explicit references to scriptural passages that discuss the influence of demons in leading people to worship idols. Additionally, a more detailed explanation of how demons exploit idolatry to draw individuals away from true worship could strengthen the response."
