According to the content provided, demons are said to be involved in the deception of idolatry. The Bible teaches that Jesus came to fulfill the commandments and to help us overcome sin and its consequences. However, the Bible also warns us about the dangers of idolatry, which is a form of worship that involves honoring someone or something other than God.

The Bible teaches that idolatry is a serious sin that can lead to eternal salvation. It says that we should love the Lord our Savior Jesus Christ above all else and that we should always put Him first in our lives.

In addition to this, the Bible also teaches that demons are involved in the deception of idolatry. Demons are described as being evil and full of sin, and they are said to be sent to help us do what is wrong. They are also said to be sent to tempt and deceive us, to make us do things that are not pleasing to God.

So, according to the Bible, demons play an important role in the deception of idolatry. They are said to be sent to help us do what is wrong and to deceive us into loving and honoring someone or something other than God. This is why it is so important for us to always remember to love the Lord our Savior Jesus Christ above all else and to always put Him first in our lives.
