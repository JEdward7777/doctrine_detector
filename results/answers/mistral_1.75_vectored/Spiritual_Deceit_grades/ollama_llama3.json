  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of remaining vigilant against spiritual deceit that can lead people away from the truth of God's sovereignty. It also correctly identifies demons as being involved in the deception of idolatry, which aligns with the provided answer.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples and Scriptural support for its claims. Additionally, some of the language used is somewhat general and could be more nuanced (e.g., the phrase \"help us do what is wrong\" is a bit vague). Nevertheless, the overall message and emphasis on spiritual vigilance are well-conveyed.\n\nComment: While this response effectively addresses the concern and provides relevant biblical information, it would benefit from more specific examples and scriptural support to strengthen its argument."
