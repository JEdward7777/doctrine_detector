  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does a great job of highlighting the importance of spiritual gifts and their purpose in building up the church and serving others. The student provides specific examples from Scripture to support their understanding, which adds credibility to their answer.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. For example, while the student mentions the importance of love as a foundation for everything we do, they do not elaborate further on how this gift specifically relates to the use of spiritual gifts in building up the church and serving others.\n\nAdditionally, the response could benefit from more depth and nuance in its discussion of the spiritual gifts. While the student provides some good examples from Scripture, they could have explored these gifts further and discussed how they can be used in various contexts to serve others.\n\nOverall, I would give this response a grade of 85 because it demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of spiritual gifts and their purpose, but could benefit from more development and elaboration."
