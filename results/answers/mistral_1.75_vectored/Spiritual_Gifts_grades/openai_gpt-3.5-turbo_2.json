The inclusion of specific Bible verses and examples further supports the understanding of spiritual gifts as tools for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. However, a minor deduction is made for the lack of direct mention of utilizing these gifts for the growth of the church specifically, which is an important aspect of serving a Christian community."
