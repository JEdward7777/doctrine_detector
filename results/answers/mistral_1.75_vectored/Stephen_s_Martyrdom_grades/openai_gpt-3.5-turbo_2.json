  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights the significance of Stephen's stoning as the first martyrdom in the early Christian church and how it exemplifies the commitment of early Christians to stand firm in their faith despite persecution. The mention of the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution aligns well with a Christian worldview. The response could have provided more specific references to biblical passages or theological teachings to further strengthen the Christian perspective, hence a slight deduction in the grade."
