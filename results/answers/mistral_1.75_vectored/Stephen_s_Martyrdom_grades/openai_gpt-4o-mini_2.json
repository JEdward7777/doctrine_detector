  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively highlights the significance of Stephen's stoning as the first martyrdom in the early Christian church, emphasizing the persecution faced by believers for their faith and testimony about Jesus. It successfully reflects on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution. The student could further strengthen the response by incorporating more scriptural references and deeper theological reflection on the meaning and implications of Stephen's martyrdom within the Christian worldview."
