## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The answer provided is not coherent and fails to address the question adequately. The student's response lacks proper explanation and biblical references regarding stoning as a punishment for adultery. The repetitive and unrelated content detracts from the clarity and substance of the answer. There is also a lack of depth in discussing God's justice and mercy in relation to the practice of stoning. Improvement in providing clear, relevant, and concise information with biblical support is necessary for a higher grade.
