  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response lacks depth and coherence. The excessive repetition of the same phrases indicates a lack of understanding or effort in addressing the question. Additionally, the student did not effectively address the concern of balancing God's justice and mercy in relation to the practice of stoning for adultery. More analysis and connection to the reference answer and Christian worldview are needed for a higher grade."
