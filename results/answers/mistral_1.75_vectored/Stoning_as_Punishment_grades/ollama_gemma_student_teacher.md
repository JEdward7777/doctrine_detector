## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately summarizes the biblical passages regarding stoning as punishment for adultery. However, it lacks nuance and fails to address the teacher's concern about balancing God's justice and mercy. The student's response simply presents the traditional interpretation of the law without considering the broader theological context or the New Testament emphasis on grace and forgiveness.
