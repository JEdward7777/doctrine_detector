## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 20.

The main issue with this response is that it completely disregards the concern about understanding the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. The response only focuses on the fact that stoning is a punishment for adultery, without providing any insight into how Jesus's interaction with the woman caught in adultery illustrates the importance of balance between justice and mercy.

Additionally, the repeated quotes from Leviticus 20:7-10 seem irrelevant to the topic of stoning as a method of execution, and instead appear to be an attempt to pad out the response rather than providing any meaningful insight or analysis.

Overall, while this response does acknowledge that the Bible refers to stoning as a method of execution for certain sins, including adultery, it fails to engage with the concern about balance between justice and mercy in God's commandments. As such, I would give it a low grade.
