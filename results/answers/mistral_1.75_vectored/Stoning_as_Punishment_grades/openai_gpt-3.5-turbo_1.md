## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1.md)
Grade: 95

Comment: The response clearly articulates the Biblical perspective on stoning as a punishment for adultery in the Old Testament and the emphasis on God's mercy and forgiveness highlighted by Jesus in the New Testament. It effectively addresses the concern by acknowledging the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. The only deduction is due to the lengthy repetition in the provided response that does not add substantial value to the answer.
