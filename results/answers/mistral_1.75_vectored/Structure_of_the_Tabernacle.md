The Tabernacle was a portable Christian church that was used during the early Christian period. It had two main sections: the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies.

The Holy Place was where Jesus would have prayed and taught. It was also where the Bible says Jesus went to pray before He went to the Holy of Holies to pray for His followers. In the Holy Place, there was a lampstand, a table with bread and wine, and a prayer table.

The Holy of Holies was the most sacred part of the Tabernacle. It was where Jesus went to pray for His followers. In the Holy of Holies, there was a lampstand, a table with bread and wine, and a prayer table.

In addition to these, the Tabernacle also contained other items such as a veil, a table of the Ten Commandments, and a Ark of the Covenant which contained the Ten Commandments.
