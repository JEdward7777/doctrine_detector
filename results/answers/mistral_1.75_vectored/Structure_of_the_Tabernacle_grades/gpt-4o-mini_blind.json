However, there are significant inaccuracies and misunderstandings present. Firstly, the Tabernacle was a place of worship for the Israelites in the Old Testament, not a portable Christian church used in the early Christian period. The details provided about Jesus' activities in the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies are not accurate. Additionally, the description of the contents of the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies is inaccurate. The Ark of the Covenant was not in the Holy of Holies but rather in the Most Holy Place. The student would benefit from a better understanding of the Old Testament and Christian theology."
