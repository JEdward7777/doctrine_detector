The description of the Tabernacle as a portable Christian church is inaccurate, and the association of Jesus with the Tabernacle is not supported by traditional Christian beliefs. Additionally, the inclusion of unrelated items like the veil, table of the Ten Commandments, and Ark of the Covenant does not align with the actual components of the tabernacle as described in the Bible."
