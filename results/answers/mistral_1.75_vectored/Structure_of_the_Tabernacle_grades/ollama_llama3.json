The correct terms used in Scripture are \"Holy Place\" and \"Holy of Holies\".\n\nThe response also misses some important details about the significance of certain components, such as the lampstand, table with bread and wine, and prayer table. It only mentions these items briefly without explaining their purpose or significance.\n\nFinally, the response incorrectly states that Jesus went to pray for His followers in the Holy Place, when in fact it was the Holy of Holies where He would have prayed (Hebrews 9:12-14).\n\nTo improve this response, the writer should strive for greater accuracy and attention to detail, as well as provide more insight into the significance of each component's role in worship."
