  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response contains some inaccuracies and misinterpretations of the components of the Tabernacle and their significance in worship. The description of the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies in the initial response is incorrect in terms of Christian theology. The student did not demonstrate a strong understanding of the significance of the components in worship as suggested by the concern provided. There is room for improvement in accurately representing Christian beliefs and practices related to the Tabernacle."
