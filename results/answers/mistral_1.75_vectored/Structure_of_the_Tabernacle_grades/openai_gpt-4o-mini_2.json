  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided some correct information about the Tabernacle, mentioning the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. However, the student inaccurately described the functions and contents of these sections, mixing Christian and Old Testament concepts. The response did not accurately address the concern of understanding the significance of the Tabernacle components in worship. There was confusion in attributing actions to Jesus within the Tabernacle. There is room for improvement in accurately portraying the Christian significance of the Tabernacle components."
