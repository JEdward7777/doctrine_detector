  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a strong answer that effectively conveys the symbolic significance of manna as God's provision and love for His people. They correctly highlight the story of God providing food for the Israelites in the wilderness and draw a connection to how God continues to provide for believers today. Additionally, the student effectively links the concept of manna to Jesus Christ as the true bread of life. However, a minor deduction is made due to slight deviation from the reference answer and unnecessary elaboration in certain parts."
