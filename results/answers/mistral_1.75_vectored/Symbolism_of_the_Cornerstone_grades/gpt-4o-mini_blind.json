The student correctly identifies Jesus as the foundation of the Christian faith and emphasizes His sacrificial love and role in salvation. However, to improve the response, the student could delve deeper into the biblical significance of Jesus as the cornerstone, perhaps by referencing specific verses like Ephesians 2:20 or 1 Peter 2:6-8. Additionally, incorporating more scriptural support would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
