  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively explains the metaphor of the cornerstone and how it relates to Jesus' role in the Christian faith. It covers three key aspects of the metaphor: Jesus as the foundation, Jesus as the rejected cornerstone, and Jesus as the precious stone that brings salvation. The response also provides some insightful connections between the metaphor and real-life applications for believers.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are:\n\n* While it touches on the idea that Jesus is the reference point for believers' lives and faith, it could delve deeper into this aspect of the metaphor.\n* It could also provide more specific examples of how understanding this relationship can help believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example.\n\nOverall, however, the response is well-organized, easy to follow, and effectively communicates the significance of the cornerstone metaphor in relation to Jesus."
