## [Answer](../Symbolism_of_the_Cornerstone.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The metaphor of the cornerstone illustrates the relationship between Jesus and His followers in several ways. First, Jesus is referred to as the "cornerstone" because He is the foundation upon which the Christian faith is built. He is the central figure around whom the entire Christian community is centered.

Second, Jesus is also referred to as the "cornerstone that was rejected." This refers to the fact that Jesus was rejected by many people, including some of his own followers, who wanted to see Him fulfill a specific role or mission. However, Jesus' ultimate mission was to love and serve others, and He fulfilled this mission through His sacrificial love for all people.

Third, Jesus is also referred to as the "cornerstone that became a precious stone." This refers to the fact that Jesus' sacrifice and love have brought salvation and forgiveness to all who believe in Him. He has become a precious stone that has been used to build up the Christian community and bring hope and peace to all who follow Him.

Overall, the metaphor of the cornerstone teaches us that Jesus is the foundation upon which we can build our lives, and that He is the one who has brought salvation and forgiveness to all who believe in Him.
