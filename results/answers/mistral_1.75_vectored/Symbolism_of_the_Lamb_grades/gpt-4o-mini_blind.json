  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComments:\nThe student demonstrates a basic understanding of the significance of using a lamb for sacrifices in the Bible and its relation to the concept of atonement. They correctly identify the Lamb as a symbol of Jesus Christ who was sacrificed for the sins of all people. However, the response lacks depth and coherence in its explanation. The student repeats similar points and does not provide specific scriptural references to support their points. Additionally, there are some repetitive and unclear statements that could be improved for clarity. Encourage the student to provide more precise and structured explanations supported by biblical references to strengthen their answer."
