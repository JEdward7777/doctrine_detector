  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the symbolism of the Lamb in the Bible and its connection to Jesus Christ as the sacrificial Lamb of God. The student effectively references biblical verses and themes to support their points. However, while the information is accurate and well-presented, there could have been more explicit integration of the provided answer regarding the atonement and symbolism of innocence and purity in the sacrifice of the Lamb. A slightly more direct connection to the central concern of atonement and redemption through Christ would have strengthened the response further."
