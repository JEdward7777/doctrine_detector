However, the statement that a synagogue is a symbol of the Christian Church is not accurate doctrinally. It is important to maintain the distinctiveness between Judaism and Christianity in discussing religious terminology. Additionally, while the concept of a \"synagogue of love or a synagogue of prayer\" is creative, it is not a commonly accepted usage of the term within a Christian context. Further clarification and explanation would have improved the answer."
