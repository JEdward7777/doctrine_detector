Comment: While the response acknowledges that "synagogue" can refer to a group of people meeting for worship, it lacks depth in discussing the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship as indicated by the term 'synagogue'. The response could have provided more insight into the importance of community, fellowship, and worship in a Christian context.
