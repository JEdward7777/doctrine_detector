However, it goes beyond the reference answer by suggesting that synagogues were places for prayer and worship, including the celebration of Christian sacraments. This is not historically accurate from a Christian perspective. While synagogues were indeed important religious centers for Jews, they were primarily used for prayer, scripture reading, and teaching about the Jewish scriptures, not Christian practices."
