Synagogues played a central role in the worship practices of Jews during ancient times. They were considered sacred places where Christians and Jews could come together to pray, study the Bible, and celebrate important events such as the Holy Days. The synagogue was also a place for teaching and learning, where people would gather to learn about the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Bible. In addition, synagogues were used for prayer and worship, including the celebration of the Lord's Supremum.

**Comments:**

The student's answer is accurate in stating that synagogues played a central role in the worship practices of Jews during ancient times. However, it goes beyond the reference answer by suggesting that synagogues were places for prayer and worship, including the celebration of Christian sacraments. This is not historically accurate from a Christian perspective. While synagogues were indeed important religious centers for Jews, they were primarily used for prayer, scripture reading, and teaching about the Jewish scriptures, not Christian practices.
