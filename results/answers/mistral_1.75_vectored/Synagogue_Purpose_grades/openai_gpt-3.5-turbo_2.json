However, there is some confusion with the mention of Christians and Jesus Christ in the original response, which is not accurately aligned with the concern of understanding the historical and religious importance of synagogues in Jewish worship. The response could be improved by focusing solely on the Jewish perspective and the significance of synagogues in their worship practices."
