Synagogues played a central role in the worship practices of Jews during ancient times. They were considered sacred places where Christians and Jews could come together to pray, study the Bible, and celebrate important events such as the Holy Days. The synagogue was also a place for teaching and learning, where people would gather to learn about the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Bible. In addition, synagogues were used for prayer and worship, including the celebration of the Lord's Supremum.

Comment: The response provides a general understanding of synagogues as places for prayer, scripture reading, and teaching for Jews living far from Jerusalem. However, there is some confusion with the mention of Christians and Jesus Christ in the original response, which is not accurately aligned with the concern of understanding the historical and religious importance of synagogues in Jewish worship. The response could be improved by focusing solely on the Jewish perspective and the significance of synagogues in their worship practices.
