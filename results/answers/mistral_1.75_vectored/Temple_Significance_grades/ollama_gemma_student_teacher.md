## Grade: 80/100

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern by acknowledging the primary purpose of the temple as a place of worship and prayer for the Israelites. It also highlights its symbolic significance as a representation of God's love and protection. 

However, the answer could benefit from greater clarity in explaining the role of the temple within the context of Old Testament worship practices, specifically mentioning the significance of sacrifices and prayers. Additionally, while it briefly mentions the temple's importance in Christian worship, it would be beneficial to elaborate on its significance in early Christian theology and practices.
