However, it doesn't directly address the concern of the geographical and theological significance of the temple in relation to Zion, which is the specific focus of the question. A more direct connection between \"Zion\" and the temple's location on the prominent hills of Jerusalem, particularly the Temple Mount, would strengthen the response and better address the given concern."
