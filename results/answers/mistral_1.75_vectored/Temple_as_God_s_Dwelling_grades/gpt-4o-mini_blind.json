  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides a basic overview of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments. However, there are several doctrinal inaccuracies and misconceptions in the answer. The New Testament references and teachings attributed to Jesus are taken out of context or misquoted. The response lacks depth and fails to articulate the significance of Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the temple. Additionally, the repetition of phrases towards the end detracts from the overall coherence of the answer. Further elaboration and correction in line with biblical teachings would significantly improve the grade."
