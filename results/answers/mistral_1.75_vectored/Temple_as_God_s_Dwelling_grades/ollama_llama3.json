  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the temple's significance in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting its role as a physical representation of God's presence and love for His people. However, it does not directly address the concern of exploring the theological implications of God dwelling among His people. While it mentions Jesus becoming the ultimate fulfillment of the temple, it does not delve deeper into what this means for believers today.\n\nThe response also repeats Jesus' promises to be with His followers multiple times, which while emphasizing His presence, does not explicitly explore the theological implications of this idea. To improve the grade, the response could have provided more specific examples or scriptural support for how God dwelling among His people affects our daily lives and our understanding of ourselves as temples of the Holy Spirit."
