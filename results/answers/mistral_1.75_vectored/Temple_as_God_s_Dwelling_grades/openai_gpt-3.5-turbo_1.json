  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people by highlighting the transition from the physical temple in the Old Testament to believers being considered the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. The connection between the physical representation of God's presence in the temple and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers is effectively explored. However, the repetition towards the end of the response detracts from the overall coherence and focus on the theological implications."
