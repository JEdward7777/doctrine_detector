  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a good exploration of the theological implications of God dwelling among His people, highlighting the transition from the physical temple in the Old Testament to believers becoming the temple of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament. The explanation of Jesus fulfilling various aspects related to the temple and emphasizing the personal relationship with Him was insightful. However, some parts of the response repeated passages excessively, affecting the overall coherence and clarity."
