  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response lacks accuracy and coherence with the Christian worldview. It seems to mix up the interactions between Jesus and Satan, leading to a confusing and incorrect depiction of Jesus' response to temptations. The answer does not align with the reference answer provided, which emphasizes Jesus' resistance and obedience to God. The student needs to study the biblical account more thoroughly to accurately understand Jesus' response to temptations and how it serves as a model for Christians."
