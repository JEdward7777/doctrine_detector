However, it lacks analysis or deeper understanding of the theological significance of Jesus' resistance to temptation. The student's repetition of Jesters' statements without providing any insight or connection to the Christian worldview does not fully address the concern related to following Jesus' example in spiritual battles. The response would benefit from further elaboration on the connection between Jesus' triumph over temptation and its relevance to Christians facing their own temptations."
