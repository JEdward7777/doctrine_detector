  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response contains a jumbled repetition of phrases that do not effectively address the concern regarding Jesus' resistance to temptation serving as a model for Christians. The answer provided lacks depth and coherence in connecting Jesus' example to the model for spiritual battles against evil. More focus and clarity are needed to address the concern from a Christian worldview."
