## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided does not directly address the concern of understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation as a model for Christians to follow in their spiritual battles against evil. The majority of the response consists of repeated text that does not contribute to addressing the concern effectively. Additionally, the response lacks depth and coherence in discussing the significance of Jesus overcoming temptation to guide and inspire Christians in their own struggles against evil. Further explanation and analysis are needed to fully address the given concern from a Christian worldview.
