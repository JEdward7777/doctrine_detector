  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: This response shows some understanding of the concept of tempting God but lacks coherence and clear biblical references to support the points made. The student's explanation of consequences of tempting God is a mix of different teachings without clear connections to the concept being discussed. Additionally, the response could benefit from more precise scripture references and a more focused explanation of how tempting God goes against biblical teachings."
