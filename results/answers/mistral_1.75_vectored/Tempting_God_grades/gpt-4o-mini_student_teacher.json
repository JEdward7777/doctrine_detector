  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: While the student attempts to explain the concept of \"tempting God,\" there are several key theological inaccuracies and discrepancies in their answer. The student incorrectly intertwines various teachings and verses without a clear understanding of their context and meaning. Additionally, the answer lacks depth and coherence pertaining to the Biblical teaching on consequences of tempting God. The student should strive for more clarity, precision, and accuracy in relating Biblical concepts to the question."
