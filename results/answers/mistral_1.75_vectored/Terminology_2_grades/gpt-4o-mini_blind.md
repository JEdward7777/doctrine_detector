Comment: The answer correctly identifies common terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in Christian communities. However, it could have been improved by mentioning terms such as "Mass" in reference to the Catholic tradition or "Divine Liturgy" in reference to the Eastern Orthodox tradition. Overall, a solid response but could have included a slightly broader range of terminology.
