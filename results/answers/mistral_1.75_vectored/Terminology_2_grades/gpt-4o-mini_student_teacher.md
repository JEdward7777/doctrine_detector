Comment: The student correctly identified some of the terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper in Christian communities, such as Holy Communion and Eucharist. However, there are additional terms like 'Sacrament of Love' and 'Bread and Wine' that are not commonly used to refer to the Lord's Supper. It would have been beneficial for the student to provide a more comprehensive list of terms commonly used within Christianity for this sacred practice.
