  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the student does mention that the Lord's Supper has different names, their answer only includes two terms (\"communion\" and \"Last Supper\"), whereas the correct response lists four terms (including three additional ones: Holy Communion, Eucharist, Sacrament of Love). The concern is to understand various terms used within Christianity to refer to this sacred practice, and while the student shows some understanding, their answer does not fully address this concern.\n\nComment: To improve, the student could have included more terms commonly used in Christian tradition to refer to the Lord's Supper, such as \"Eucharist\" or \"Sacrament of Love\". This would demonstrate a broader understanding of the various names and labels used within Christianity."
