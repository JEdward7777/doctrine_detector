However, the response provided in the original answer was more comprehensive in listing various terms associated with the Lord's Supper, including 'Holy Communion,' 'Eucharist,' 'Sacrament of Love,' and 'the Bread and Wine.' To improve, the response could have included a few more terms beyond just 'communion' and 'Last Supper.'"
