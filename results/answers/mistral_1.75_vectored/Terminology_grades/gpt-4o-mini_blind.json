  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a good list of alternative terms that can be used to describe a deacon, highlighting their role as a servant in the Christian context. The terms listed align well with the biblical understanding of the deacon's role and capture various aspects of their service within the church. Good effort overall, but slight improvement could be made by including more traditional or commonly used terms in addition to the suggestions given."
