  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern of recognizing various ways to identify service roles within the church by providing some alternative terms for describing a deacon. However, it does not fully capture the breadth of possible descriptions and only provides a limited list of options. Additionally, while the listed terms may be relevant to Christian service, they do not explicitly connect the concept of a deacon to Christ or the Church in the same way that the provided answer does.\n\nThe comment for this grade would be: \"While the response attempts to provide some alternative terms for describing a deacon, it falls short of fully capturing the range of possible descriptions and does not explicitly connect the concept of a deacon to Christ or the Church. The concern is partially addressed but could be improved with more creative and biblically-grounded examples.\""
