Comment: The response provided a good list of alternative terms to describe a deacon that align with Christian understanding of service roles within the church. The inclusion of terms like "minister," "servant," and "disciple" reflect the different aspects of a deacon's role in serving God and the church community. However, there could have been more emphasis on the spiritual aspect of the role, such as terms like "spiritual leader" or "Christ's servant." Overall, the answer demonstrates a solid understanding of recognizing service roles within a Christian context.
