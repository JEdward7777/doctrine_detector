However, there is a doctrinal inaccuracy in equating Christians and the Church as interchangeable terms with Israel in this context. While Christians are considered part of the Church, the term \"God's chosen people\" in the biblical context typically refers to the nation of Israel in the Old Testament and the spiritual Israel, comprised of believers in Jesus Christ, in the New Testament. It is important to differentiate between these terms to maintain doctrinal accuracy."
