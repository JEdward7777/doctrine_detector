However, they mentioned \"Christians\" and \"Church\" as interchangeably used terms, which is not the case in the context of the Bible. The reference answer highlights the terms 'Hebrews,' 'Israelites,' and 'Jews,' which are more accurate in representing God's chosen people throughout the Bible. The explanation provided shows a basic understanding, but there is a need for clarity and alignment with the specific terms mentioned in the reference answer."
