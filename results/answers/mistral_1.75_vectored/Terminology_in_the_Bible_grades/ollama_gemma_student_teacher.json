However, the student's answer could benefit from greater precision in defining the terms. For example, the student does not explain the historical context of the term \"Israel\" or the theological significance of the term \"Church.\" Additionally, the student's answer does not include the term \"Hebrews,\" which is often used interchangeably with \"Israelites\" and \"Jews\" in the Bible."
