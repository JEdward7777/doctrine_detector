However, there is a slight deviation in the explanation regarding the terms used to refer to God's chosen people, where Israel, Christians, and the Church are described. While the response is accurate in mentioning Israel as a chosen people in the Bible, Christians and the Church are more specifically related to the New Testament and the followers of Jesus Christ. Incorporating this distinction would have strengthened the response from a Christian-specific worldview."
