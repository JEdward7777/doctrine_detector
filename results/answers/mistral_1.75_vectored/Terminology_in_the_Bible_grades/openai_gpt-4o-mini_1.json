However, it does not directly address the initial answer provided, which focused on the terms related to God's chosen people in a broader sense. Connecting the terms 'Hebrews,' 'Israelites,' and 'Jews' to the concept of God's chosen people in the Bible would have strengthened the response and made it more cohesive from a Christian worldview perspective."
