## [Answer](../Terminology_in_the_Bible.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The three terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible are:

1. Israel
2. Christians
3. Church

Israel is a specific group of people who were chosen by God to be his people, and they are referred to throughout the Old and New Testament. Christians are also referred to as the Church, which refers to the body of believers who have been saved through Jesus Christ. Both Israel and Christians are considered God's chosen people, and they are called to serve and love God.

Comment: The response provides some accurate information about the terms used to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible, but it lacks a specific focus on the terms 'Hebrews,' 'Israelites,' and 'Jews' as mentioned in the given answer. The connection between these terms and their significance in understanding the context and audience of Biblical texts is not fully addressed. More emphasis on the importance of recognizing these specific terms would have improved the response.
