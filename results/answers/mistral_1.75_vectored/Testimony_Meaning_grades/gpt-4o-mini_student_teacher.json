  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a generally good explanation of testimony in the context of the Bible, highlighting the importance of conveying God's commands and teachings. However, the student's answer lacks a specific reference to the significance of the tablets of stone as a form of testimony in the Bible, which is a key aspect according to the reference answer provided by the teacher. To improve the grade, the student should include this aspect and further emphasize the connection between testimony and God's commandments as highlighted in the concern."
