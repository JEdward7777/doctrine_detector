  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of why it is wrong to put God to the test by highlighting how it can be seen as trying to make Him perform miracles for our own benefit and taking advantage of His mercy, which undermines His sovereignty and holiness. The student effectively ties this concept back to maintaining a proper relationship with God, demonstrating an understanding of the importance of this principle in a Christian worldview. The response could be improved by further emphasizing the aspect of trust and faith in God's goodness and faithfulness in addition to acknowledging His power and holiness."
