## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, testing is often seen as a way to strengthen and grow in faith. It is a time of spiritual growth and preparation for greater blessings. Jesus said, "For this is what I am commanding you: that whoever loves me will also love me and fulfill my commandments." (John 13:26).

Temptation, on the other hand, is a time of temptment to do something wrong or sinful. It is a time of temptation to turn away from God's commands and to follow the desires of the flesh. Jesus said, "For it is written, 'Love the Lord your Christian name, and I will give you a blessing.' (Matthew 7:47).

In both cases, the ultimate goal is to grow closer to God and to be more like Jesus Christ. However, testing is a positive and uplifting experience while temptation is a negative and sinful one.
