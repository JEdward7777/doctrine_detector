  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: \nThe answer provides a basic understanding of the concepts of testing and temptation in a biblical context. The student correctly identifies testing as a means of spiritual growth and preparation, and temptation as a lure towards sin. However, there are a few doctrinal inaccuracies in the answer, such as misquoting scripture (John 13:26 and Matthew 7:47) and some confusion in distinguishing between the two concepts. The student could improve by providing more precise explanations supported by accurate biblical references."
