  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the concepts of testing and temptation from a biblical perspective. It accurately highlights the distinction between testing as experiences that reveal strengths and weaknesses, and temptation as an invitation to sin. The explanation aligns well with the biblical context and the importance of spiritual discernment. A slight deduction is made for some minor discrepancies in the scriptural references and the wording used, but overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
