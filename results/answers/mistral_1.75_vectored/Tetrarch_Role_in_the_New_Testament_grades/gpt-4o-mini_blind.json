  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComments: The student showed a misunderstanding of the question by providing generic information about the roles of Herod Antipas in the New Testament. The response primarily focused on the Holy Spirit's gifts instead of addressing Herod Antipas' specific roles in the biblical narrative. It is important for the student to review and accurately understand the context of the question to provide relevant and doctrinally correct answers."
