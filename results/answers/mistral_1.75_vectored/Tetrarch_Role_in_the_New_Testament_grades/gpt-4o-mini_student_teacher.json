  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response is severely off-track and not relevant to the roles of Herod Antipas in the New Testament. They have provided incorrect information and heavily focused on the Holy Spirit's work instead of addressing Herod Antipas's actual actions as outlined in the reference answer. It is crucial for students to accurately understand and interpret historical and biblical contexts to provide informed responses."
