However, it lacks depth in terms of linking the phrase specifically to key Christian doctrines such as the importance of faith in Jesus for salvation, the centrality of Christ's death and resurrection, and the necessity of ongoing faithfulness. A stronger integration of these doctrinal elements would improve the overall response in terms of doctrinal correctness."
