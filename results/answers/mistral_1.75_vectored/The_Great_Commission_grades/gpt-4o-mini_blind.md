Grade: 60

Comment: The answer is partially correct. While it correctly mentions the command to make new followers of Jesus and fulfill the Great Commission, it fails to mention the specific command Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven, which is to wait for the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem (Acts 1:4-5). Additionally, the statement about baptizing in the name of Jesus could be clarified to align with the Trinitarian formula of baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as instructed by Jesus in Matthew 28:19.
