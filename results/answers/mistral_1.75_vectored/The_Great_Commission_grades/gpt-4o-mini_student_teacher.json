  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer shows a good understanding of the command Jesus gave to His disciples before ascending to heaven, mentioning elements of serving others and making new followers of Jesus. However, there is a slight deviation from the specific command of making disciples of all nations and teaching them to obey everything Jesus commanded. The student's answer could have been improved by focusing more directly on the Great Commission as the central command given by Jesus to His disciples."
