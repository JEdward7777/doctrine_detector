## Grade: 85/100

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies two key commands given by Jesus to His disciples: loving and serving others and making disciples. It also accurately references the Great Commission. However, the sentence about making the Holy Spirit available lacks specific biblical support from the provided reference.
