  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response lacks accuracy and understanding of the specific verse referenced in James 2:13. The student's interpretation is fairly general and does not directly address how the principle of mercy affects God's judgment of us as asked in the question. Additionally, there is some confusion in referencing different passages such as the misquoting of James 2:13 and Matthew 7:12. The answer would benefit from a clearer focus on the concept of mercy in relation to God's judgment according to the verse provided."
