  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response discussing the importance of mercy in Christian teachings and living it out in daily life. However, the answer did not directly address the specific verse in James 2:13 and its implications for God's judgment. While the student touched on forgiveness and mercy, they could have tied it back to how God's judgment is influenced by our demonstration of mercy. A more focused and direct connection to the biblical verse would have strengthened the response."
