However, the explanation lacks specificity regarding the aspect of God writing His law on the hearts of people. The student could have delved deeper into the transformative nature of this act, emphasizing how it signifies a personal and direct relationship with God that leads to internal conviction and alignment with His will. More scriptural references and theological depth would have enhanced the response."
