## [Answer](../The_New_Covenant.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the New Covenant, Jesus Christ offers a new and deeper way to follow God. One of the ways He did this is by offering a new way to receive the Holy Spirit, which would help us to love and obey God more deeply.

One of the ways that Jesus fulfilled this promise is through the Holy Spirit's guidance and empowerment. The Holy Spirit would help us to remember and apply the teachings of Jesus, and to live out the commands of Jesus in our daily lives.

In addition to this, Jesus also promised that He would write His law on the heart of those who follow Him. This means that He would give us a deep desire to love and obey God, and would enable us to do so through the power of the Holy Spirit.

This promise is fulfilled in the Holy Spirit's guidance and empowerment, as well as in the Holy Spirit's gift of love and joy. Through the Holy Spirit, we are enabled to love and serve God with all of our heart, mind, and soul.
