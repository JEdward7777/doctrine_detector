The mention of persecution and suffering for one's faith is also important.\n\nHowever, the response could have explored this topic more deeply by discussing the various aspects of being glorified with Christ, such as the role of sanctification, the connection between glory and worship, or the implications for daily life and discipleship.\n\nAdditionally, while the response does mention that believers will be transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection, it could have further emphasized this idea by highlighting the hope and future promise of glory for believers."
