## [Answer](../The_Role_of_Believers_in_Glory.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the New Testament, being glorified with Christ means that believers are made holy and perfect through Jesus Christ. This is a spiritual transformation that involves becoming more like Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate example of love, humility, and sacrifice.

Being glorified with Christ also means that believers will receive eternal life and inherit a new heaven and a new Jerusalem. This is a promise of eternal salvation and eternal blessings that will be fulfilled in the future.

In addition to this, being glorified with Christ also means that believers will be persecuted and suffer for their faith. The Bible teaches that Christians will be persecuted for their faith, but they will also be blessed and glorified in the end.

The ultimate goal of being glorified with Christ is to bring glory and honor to God. Believers are called to live a life of love, forgiveness, and obedience to Jesus Christ, so that they can be glorified with Him and bring glory to God.
