They correctly highlight the centrality of cleansing in the New Testament and the role of Jesus in cleansing us from sin through His sacrificial love. However, the response could be strengthened by providing more scriptural references to support the points made and by delving deeper into the theological significance of cleansing in the context of sin and redemption. Additionally, emphasizing the necessity of repentance and faith in Jesus for cleansing would enhance the overall explanation."
