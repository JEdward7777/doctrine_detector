They effectively highlight the importance of being cleansed and transformed by Jesus. However, the student's response could have been more concise and focused on emphasizing Jesus' sacrifice as the ultimate cleansing from sin, akin to the reference answer provided by the teacher. Ensuring a more direct connection to Christ's redemptive work would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
