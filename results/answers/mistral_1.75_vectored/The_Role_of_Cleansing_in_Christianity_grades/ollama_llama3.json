It also effectively connects Old Testament practices with New Testament teachings, recognizing that Jesus' sacrifice provides ultimate cleansing from sin.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could further emphasize the connection between Old Testament practices (such as Leviticus 16:16-20) and New Testament teachings on cleansing, as well as provide more specific examples of how this concept applies to daily life."
