However, the response could have been improved by incorporating a deeper exploration of how Old Testament practices, such as sacrificial offerings for cleansing from sin, foreshadow and point to Christ's ultimate redemptive work in the New Testament. A more thorough analysis of this relationship would have enhanced the understanding and appreciation of Christ's redemptive work."
