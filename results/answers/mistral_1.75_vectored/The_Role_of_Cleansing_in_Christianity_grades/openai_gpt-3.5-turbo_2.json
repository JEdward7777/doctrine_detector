The student effectively conveys the importance of being made clean in God's eyes through Christ. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection between Old Testament practices (such as sacrificial rituals) and how they foreshadowed Christ's redemptive work in the New Testament. Expanding on this connection would further deepen the explanation and understanding of the significance of Christ's redemptive work."
