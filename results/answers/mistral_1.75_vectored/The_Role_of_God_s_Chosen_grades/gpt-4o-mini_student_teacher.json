  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student correctly identifies Moses and King David as chosen ones by God for specific roles, the answer lacks depth in recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders. The student could have delved deeper into the significance of God's divine purpose and plans in appointing leaders and how this reflects His ultimate authority over His people. Overall, the answer shows a basic understanding of the concept but could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of God's sovereignty and its implications for the Christian community."
