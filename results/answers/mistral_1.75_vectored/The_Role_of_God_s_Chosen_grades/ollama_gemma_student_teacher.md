## [Answer](../The_Role_of_God_s_Chosen.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, Moses and King David are considered "chosen ones" because they were chosen by God to fulfill specific roles in His plan.

Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and to receive the Ten Commandments from God. He was also chosen to be a servant and leader to the people of Israel. This implies that God has a specific purpose for each person and that He chooses who will fulfill those purposes.

King David was also chosen by God to be a servant and leader to the people of Israel. He was chosen to be a shepherd and to fulfill the prophecy of Jesus Christ. This implies that God has a specific plan for salvation and that He chose David to be part of that plan.

This also implies that God's selection process is not based on human qualities or abilities but on His love and desire to fulfill His plan. It also shows that God has a special purpose for each person and that He wants to use them to fulfill that purpose.
