  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response effectively answers the given question by highlighting Moses and King David as examples of God's chosen leaders in the Bible. It accurately explains their roles and the implications of being \"chosen\" by God. The writer also makes a clear connection between God's selection process and His sovereignty, which is relevant to the concern about recognizing God's sovereignty in appointing leaders.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more specific biblical examples or quotes to support the claims made. Additionally, exploring the implications of God's sovereignty for the Christian community would strengthen the connection to the concern.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of being \"chosen\" and its significance in the context of leadership. While it could be more detailed and explicit in its exploration of the concern, it provides a solid foundation for further discussion."
