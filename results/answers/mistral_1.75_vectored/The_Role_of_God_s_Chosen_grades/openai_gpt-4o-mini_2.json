The explanation aligns well with a Christian worldview by emphasizing God's role in choosing and using individuals to fulfill His greater plan. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more specific references to biblical passages that highlight God's sovereignty in appointing leaders, which would further strengthen the response."
