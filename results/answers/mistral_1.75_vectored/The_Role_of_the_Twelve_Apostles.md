The twelve apostles are significant because they were the twelve followers of Jesus Christ whom He sent to spread His teachings and mission to the whole world. They were also called the "Twelve Apostles" because they were also called to be apostles, which means to be sent to serve and love others.

The twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus to represent the twelve tribes of Israel, and they were also meant to be a symbol of the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit. Each of the apostles had a special gift and was given a specific mission to fulfill.

In addition to spreading the Gospel message, the apostles were also meant to be a witness to the life, teachings, and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. They were also meant to be a source of comfort and encouragement to those who were persecuted for their faith in Jesus.

The twelve apostles are considered to be the foundation of the Christian Church, and their teachings and example continue to guide Christians today.
