  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. It provides some additional information beyond what was provided in the original answer, such as the significance of the twelve tribes of Israel and the symbol of the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit. The response also acknowledges the apostles' role in spreading the Gospel message and serving as a witness to Jesus' life, teachings, and sacrifice.\n\nHowever, the response does not specifically address how the apostles were tasked with continuing Jesus' teachings after His ascension, which was mentioned in the original answer. Additionally, some of the information provided is not directly related to the concern at hand (e.g., the symbolism of the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit).\n\nOverall, while the response provides some valuable insights into the importance of the apostles, it could be improved by more clearly addressing the specific point made in the original answer and staying focused on the main concern."
