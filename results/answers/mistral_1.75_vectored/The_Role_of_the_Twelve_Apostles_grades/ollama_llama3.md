## [Answer](../The_Role_of_the_Twelve_Apostles.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The twelve apostles are significant because they were the twelve followers of Jesus Christ whom He sent to spread His teachings and mission to the whole world. They were also called the "Twelve Apostles" because they were also called to be apostles, which means to be sent to serve and love others.

The twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus to represent the twelve tribes of Israel, and they were also meant to be a symbol of the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit. Each of the apostles had a special gift and was given a specific mission to fulfill.

In addition to spreading the Gospel message, the apostles were also meant to be a witness to the life, teachings, and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. They were also meant to be a source of comfort and encouragement to those who were persecuted for their faith in Jesus.

The twelve apostles are considered to be the foundation of the Christian Church, and their teachings and example continue to guide Christians today.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. It provides some additional information beyond what was provided in the original answer, such as the significance of the twelve tribes of Israel and the symbol of the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit. The response also acknowledges the apostles' role in spreading the Gospel message and serving as a witness to Jesus' life, teachings, and sacrifice.

However, the response does not specifically address how the apostles were tasked with continuing Jesus' teachings after His ascension, which was mentioned in the original answer. Additionally, some of the information provided is not directly related to the concern at hand (e.g., the symbolism of the twelve fruits of the Holy Spirit).

Overall, while the response provides some valuable insights into the importance of the apostles, it could be improved by more clearly addressing the specific point made in the original answer and staying focused on the main concern.
