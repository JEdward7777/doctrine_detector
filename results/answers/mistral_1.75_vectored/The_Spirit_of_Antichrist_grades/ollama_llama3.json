The excessive repetition of Jesus' words about being with us always distracts from the main point and makes it difficult to grasp the key message. Furthermore, the concern of recognizing the spirit of antichrist as crucial for staying vigilant against deception is not adequately addressed in this response. A more focused and concise answer that directly addresses the concern would be expected at a higher grade level."
