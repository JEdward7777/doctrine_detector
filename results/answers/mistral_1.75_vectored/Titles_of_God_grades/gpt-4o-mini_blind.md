## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
This response seems to have misunderstood the question as it is asking for titles that specifically refer to God as 'Almighty.' While the student has listed various titles used in the Bible, not all of them directly refer to God as Almighty. 

Grade: 40

The response is partially correct in listing some titles used in the Bible, but the focus should have been on titles that explicitly refer to God as 'Almighty.' The student should have included titles such as 'God Almighty,' 'Almighty God,' or 'Lord Almighty.' Encouraging deeper understanding and accuracy would enhance the response.
