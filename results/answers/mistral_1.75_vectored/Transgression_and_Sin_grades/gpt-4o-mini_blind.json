The reference to Jesus Christ as the means of forgiveness and salvation is appropriate from a Christian worldview. However, the response could be strengthened by further emphasizing the consequences of sin and the need for repentance and turning away from sinful behaviors. Additionally, tying in the concept of redemption through Christ's sacrifice would enhance the doctrinal depth of the answer."
