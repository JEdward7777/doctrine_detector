## [Answer](../Transgression_and_Sin.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Transgression is a term that refers to any act or behavior that goes beyond what is considered acceptable or right. This can include acts of sin, such as lying, stealing, or murder, but it can also include acts of disobedience, such as following the wrong command or going against the teachings of a religion. In both cases, transgression involves doing something that is not in line with God's will or the teachings of the Bible. It is important to remember that transgression is always forgiven through Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and offers us eternal salvation.
