  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The answer provided contains several inaccuracies and misunderstandings of biblical concepts. The Holy Bible is not a physical dwelling place like the Tabernacle was, but rather a collection of sacred texts that serve as a guide for Christians. Jesus Christ is not the builder of the Holy Bible, but rather its central figure as revealed in the New Testament. The explanation lacks doctrinal correctness and misrepresents key elements of the Bible and the role of the Tabernacle in Israelite worship. More theological accuracy and clarity are needed to improve the grade."
