## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle and started using the Holy Bible as their guide. The Tabernacle was a temporary dwelling place for the Israelites, built according to God's instructions in the Old Testament. It was used during the time of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, until they were led into the Promised Land.

The Tabernacle was a symbol of God's love and protection for His people. It was also a reminder of the importance of following God's commands and living according to His teachings.

However, after the Israelites entered the Promised Land, they were instructed to build a permanent dwelling place for God, called the Holy Bible. This new dwelling place would be a more permanent and holy place where God could dwell with His people.

So, the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle and began using the Holy Bible as their guide. The Holy Bible is a sacred text that contains the teachings of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. It is a source of guidance and inspiration for Christians around the world.

40.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The answer provided contains several inaccuracies and misunderstandings of biblical concepts. The Holy Bible is not a physical dwelling place like the Tabernacle was, but rather a collection of sacred texts that serve as a guide for Christians. Jesus Christ is not the builder of the Holy Bible, but rather its central figure as revealed in the New Testament. The explanation lacks doctrinal correctness and misrepresents key elements of the Bible and the role of the Tabernacle in Israelite worship. More theological accuracy and clarity are needed to improve the grade.
