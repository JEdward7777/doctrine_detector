  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks accuracy and understanding of the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple. While the student mentions the Holy Bible, it is not accurate to say that the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle and began using the Holy Bible as their guide. The primary reason for the Israelites to stop using the Tabernacle was the construction of the temple in Jerusalem by Solomon, not the adoption of the Holy Bible as a guide for worship. The student's response does not address the specific concern about the transition in worship practices effectively."
