## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle and started using the Holy Bible as their guide. The Tabernacle was a temporary dwelling place for the Israelites, built according to God's instructions in the Old Testament. It was used during the time of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, until they were led into the Promised Land.

The Tabernacle was a symbol of God's love and protection for His people. It was also a reminder of the importance of following God's commands and living according to His teachings.

However, after the Israelites entered the Promised Land, they were instructed to build a permanent dwelling place for God, called the Holy Bible. This new dwelling place would be a more permanent and holy place where God could dwell with His people.

So, the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle and began using the Holy Bible as their guide. The Holy Bible is a sacred text that contains the teachings of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. It is a source of guidance and inspiration for Christians around the world.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer lacks accuracy and understanding of the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple. While the student mentions the Holy Bible, it is not accurate to say that the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle and began using the Holy Bible as their guide. The primary reason for the Israelites to stop using the Tabernacle was the construction of the temple in Jerusalem by Solomon, not the adoption of the Holy Bible as a guide for worship. The student's response does not address the specific concern about the transition in worship practices effectively.
