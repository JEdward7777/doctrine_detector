## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle and started using the Holy Bible as their guide. The Tabernacle was a temporary dwelling place for the Israelites, built according to God's instructions in the Old Testament. It was used during the time of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, until they were led into the Promised Land.

The Tabernacle was a symbol of God's love and protection for His people. It was also a reminder of the importance of following God's commands and living according to His teachings.

However, after the Israelites entered the Promised Land, they were instructed to build a permanent dwelling place for God, called the Holy Bible. This new dwelling place would be a more permanent and holy place where God could dwell with His people.

So, the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle and began using the Holy Bible as their guide. The Holy Bible is a sacred text that contains the teachings of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God and the Savior of the world. It is a source of guidance and inspiration for Christians around the world.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response does acknowledge that the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle, which is correct. However, it is unclear from the text whether they stopped using the Tabernacle because they built the Temple in Jerusalem or if they built the Temple as a permanent dwelling place for God. The concern was to understand the transition in worship practices from the tabernacle to the temple, but this response does not explicitly address that transition.

The response also fails to mention the significance of Jesus Christ and His teachings in relation to the Holy Bible.
