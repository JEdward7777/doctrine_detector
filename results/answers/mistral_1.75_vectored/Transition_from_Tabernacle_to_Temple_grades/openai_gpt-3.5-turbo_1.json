However, the response also includes some inaccuracies by equating the Holy Bible to a physical dwelling place like the Tabernacle and Temple, which is not a correct representation of the role of the Bible in Christian worship practices. So while the response addresses the concern to some extent, it could benefit from a clearer distinction between physical structures and the role of Scripture in Christian worship."
