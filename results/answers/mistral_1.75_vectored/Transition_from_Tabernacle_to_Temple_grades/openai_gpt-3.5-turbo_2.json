However, there are inaccuracies in referring to the Holy Bible as a physical dwelling place for God, which is not a correct interpretation in a Christian worldview. Additionally, it does not delve deeply into the significance of this transition in worship practices, which is important for a comprehensive understanding within a Christian perspective."
