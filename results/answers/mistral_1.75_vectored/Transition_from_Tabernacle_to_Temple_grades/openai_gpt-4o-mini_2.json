  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provided a satisfactory explanation of the transition from the Tabernacle to the Temple in Jerusalem, mentioning the role of Solomon in building the temple as a permanent place of worship for the Israelites. However, there is some confusion between the Tabernacle and the Holy Bible in the explanation provided. The Holy Bible is a collection of sacred texts, while the Temple in Jerusalem was the physical structure where worship took place. Clarification on this distinction would improve the overall response."
