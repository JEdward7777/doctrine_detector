The translations given do not align with the original meaning of the Hebrew term. The incorrect translations provided and the lack of understanding of the significance of the term demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of biblical languages and concepts. It is important for the student to study and research more on biblical terms and translations to provide accurate and doctrinally sound information."
