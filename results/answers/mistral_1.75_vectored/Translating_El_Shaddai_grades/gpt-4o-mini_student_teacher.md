Comment: The student's answer is inaccurate and confusing. They incorrectly translated "El Shaddai" into different languages, which resulted in a major distortion of the original meaning. Additionally, their translations into various languages as "Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior" are entirely incorrect and show a lack of understanding of the linguistic and cultural considerations necessary for accurate translation. The focus should have been on accurately representing the meaning of "El Shaddai" in different languages, not substituting it with a different phrase.
