  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response accurately addresses the concern about ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages by highlighting the translation of \"El Shaddai\" as 'God Almighty' or 'Shaddai'. However, the provided answer is incomplete as it does not address the inaccuracies in the translations provided in the original response. The original response contains incorrect translations of \"El Shaddai\" into other languages such as Spanish, French, German, Greek, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, and Arabic. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of accurate translations to uphold the integrity and reverence of God's name in different cultural contexts."
