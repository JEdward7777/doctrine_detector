  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the different ways in which fear of God can be translated in the Bible, highlighting the importance of reverence and obedience to God. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the translations 'deep respect,' 'reverence,' and 'awe' as provided in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have aligned more closely with the reference answer to enhance the clarity and depth of their response."
