The integration of biblical verses further strengthens the explanation. However, the concern raised about the misinterpretation of 'fear' leading to a distorted view of God is not directly addressed in the response. It would have been beneficial to touch upon how a proper understanding of fear of God is crucial in maintaining a healthy faith and spiritual life."
