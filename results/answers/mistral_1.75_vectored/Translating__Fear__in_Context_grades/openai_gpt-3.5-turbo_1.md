1. "Fear of the Lord" - This phrase is used in the Old Testament and emphasizes the importance of reverence and obedience to God. It also reminds us that God is holy and should be treated with respect.

2. "Love and fear of the Lord" - In the New Testament, Jesus teaches us to love God and have fear for Him. This means loving God deeply and having a deep reverence for Him.
