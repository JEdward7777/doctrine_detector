However, the focus of the question was on suggested translations specifically for humans and Jesus, and the answer could have delved deeper into the theological implications of these translations in relation to humans and Jesus as bearers of the image of God. Additionally, while the emphasis on love and service is commendable, more doctrinal precision could have been incorporated to align the translations more closely with Christian teachings on the nature and purpose of humanity and the person of Jesus Christ."
