  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided translations for the phrase \"image of God\" that emphasize the importance of loving and serving others as we love and serve Jesus, which aligns with Christian teachings. However, the translations the student offered did not directly address the distinct nature of humanity's relation to God and Christ's divine nature as the reference answer indicated. The student could enhance their answer by incorporating translations that specifically highlight these key aspects within a Christian worldview."
