While the response mentions that the translations are significant and should guide our actions and attitudes towards others, it does not delve deeper into how different translations can affect our understanding of the biblical teaching.\n\nThe provided answer is somewhat relevant to the concern, as it mentions different translations for \"image of God\" in the context of humanity and Jesus. However, the response could have more thoroughly explored the implications of these translations on our understanding of the biblical teaching and its application to daily life."
