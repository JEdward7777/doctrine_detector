  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates some understanding of the significance of the term \"Lord\" in the Bible, particularly in referencing Jesus and God. However, the student's explanation lacks clarity in addressing why many Bible translations use 'LORD' instead of 'Yahweh.' The answer mostly focuses on the symbolic aspect of the term \"Lord\" rather than the historical tradition and reverence for God's name. The connection between the New Testament usage of \"Lord\" and the translation choice in the Old Testament is not clearly made in the student's response."
