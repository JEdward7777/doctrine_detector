  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided some good alternative translations for the phrase \"to be zealous\" that reflect its biblical meaning, the focus was primarily on the actions and attitudes related to faith and service rather than directly capturing the intensity and determination implied by the term. The translations given by the student are more focused on the outcomes of zeal rather than the zeal itself, which could have been strengthened by including translations that directly emphasize the fervor and intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith."
