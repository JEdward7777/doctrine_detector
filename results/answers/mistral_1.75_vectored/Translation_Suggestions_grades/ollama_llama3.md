60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the response does provide alternative translations for "to be zealous", they are not directly related to the biblical meaning of the phrase. The original answer provides translations that reflect the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith, which aligns with the concern. In contrast, the provided translations focus more on actions and efforts rather than the depth of devotion and commitment.

The response could be improved by providing translations that better capture the spiritual intensity and commitment expected in the biblical sense. For example, instead of "be strongly diligent", they could have mentioned "be fervent in spirit" or "have a burning passion for God".
