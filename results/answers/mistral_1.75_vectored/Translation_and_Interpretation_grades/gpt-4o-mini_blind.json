However, there is room for improvement in providing more specific and detailed information on the significance and implications of using \"Lord\" in reference to God versus ordinary people from a Christian perspective. Additionally, they could delve deeper into the theological implications of using \"Lord\" for Jesus Christ as the Son of God."
