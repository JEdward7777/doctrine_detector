The proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms, such as \"Lord,\" are crucial for accurately understanding the nature of God and His relationship with humanity. The student should have included the key point that the term \"Lord\" is capitalized when referring to God as a title, setting it apart from its usage in reference to other authorities or individuals."
