  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the difference in translation of \"Lord\" depending on the context. \nThey correctly explain that in Christian contexts, \"Lord\" is primarily used for Jesus Christ, while in other contexts, it can refer to authority figures. \nThe student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer and provides a clear explanation of the capitalization convention for referring to God."
