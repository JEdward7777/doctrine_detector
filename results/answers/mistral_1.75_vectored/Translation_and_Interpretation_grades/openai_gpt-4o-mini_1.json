  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately explains the translation and usage of the term \"Lord\" in different contexts, touching on its significance in Christian belief. It correctly acknowledges the importance of understanding the context for proper usage. However, the response could have delved deeper into the significance of \"Lord\" as a title for Jesus Christ in the Christian worldview, emphasizing its theological importance. More explicit connections to the impact of correct translation on the understanding of scripture and the nature of God would have strengthened the response."
