  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer does touch on the concept of something being considered very wrong or sinful, which is partially correct in terms of the meaning of \"abomination\" in a biblical context. However, the student's response lacks accuracy in addressing the severity and specific nature of actions that are considered abominable according to God's laws. The reference answer provides clearer and more precise translations that better convey the gravity of the term 'abomination' in a biblical context. The student's answer also includes some unrelated information about the Holy Spirit, which does not directly address the question at hand. Therefore, a lower grade is warranted due to the lack of precision and focus in the student's response."
