  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer correctly identifies that the term \"abomination\" is used in the Bible to refer to something that is considered very wrong or sinful. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples of how the term \"abomination\" is used in the Bible. Additionally, the student's answer does not fully address the concern about accurate translation, as it does not provide any information about how to translate the term \"abomination\" in different contexts."
