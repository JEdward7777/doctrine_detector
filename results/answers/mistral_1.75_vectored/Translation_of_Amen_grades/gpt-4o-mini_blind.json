  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The answer provided does not accurately address the potential translations of 'truly' as used by Jesus. The translations provided are not directly related to the term 'truly' and do not align with the original Greek word for 'truly' (Amen). Additionally, some of the translations given are not reflective of biblical passages that contain the term 'truly'. The response lacks doctrinal accuracy in explaining the significance of 'truly' as a term of affirmation and certainty used by Jesus in his teachings. Further study and understanding of biblical hermeneutics and context is recommended."
