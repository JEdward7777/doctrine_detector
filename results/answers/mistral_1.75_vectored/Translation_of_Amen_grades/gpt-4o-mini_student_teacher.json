  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response is incorrect as they provided translations that do not accurately capture the meaning of \"truly\" as used by Jesus in the Bible. It is essential to focus on accuracy in biblical translation and interpretation, and in this case, the student's answer does not align with the Christian understanding of the term. The translations provided by the student are not reflective of the true meaning of \"truly\" as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher. It is crucial for the student to deepen their understanding of biblical interpretations and strive for precision in their responses."
