The majority of the response consists of repetitive examples of Jesus' statements with varying translations, which lacks depth and analysis. Furthermore, there is no direct connection made between these translations and the original concern about understanding the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. A better response would have explored the significance of \"truly\" in biblical contexts, including its role in emphasizing the importance of Jesus' teachings, while also highlighting the importance of accurate translation and interpretation in conveying the intended meaning."
