Comment: While the response attempted to provide translations of "truly" in the Bible, it did not accurately align with the given answer or show a clear understanding of the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. The translations provided were not consistent with the original answer and lacked depth in terms of Christian worldview interpretation. There is room for improvement in linking the translations to the significance of accurate interpretation in conveying the message of the Bible.
