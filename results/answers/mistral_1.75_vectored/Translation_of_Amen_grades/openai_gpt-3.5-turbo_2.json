  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response attempts to explore the translation of \"truly\" in the Bible, it strays from the given answer of \"'Yes, I tell you sincerely' or 'What I am telling you is true.\" The concern about accurate biblical translation and interpretation is not fully addressed as the examples provided do not align closely with the original answer given. However, the response does demonstrate an engagement with biblical passages and the importance of context in interpretation."
