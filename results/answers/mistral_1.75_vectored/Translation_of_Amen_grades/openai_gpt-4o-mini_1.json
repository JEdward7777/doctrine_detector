  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provided alternate translations of \"truly\" in the Bible, but it did not directly address the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation as the concern specified. While the examples given were insightful, the focus should have been more on how accurate translation and interpretation are crucial for understanding the true meaning of biblical passages. Additional explanation linking the translations to the concern would have improved the grade."
