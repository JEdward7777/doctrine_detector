However, the translations given do not directly align with the original answer of \"'Yes, I tell you sincerely' or 'What I am telling you is true.'\" The response could have focused more on explaining the significance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation rather than just providing alternative translations without a clear connection to the original phrase."
