Grade: 60

Comment: The response provides potential translations of "truly" based on specific Bible verses attributed to Jesus, which shows effort in understanding the importance of biblical translation and interpretation. However, the translations given do not directly align with the original answer of "'Yes, I tell you sincerely' or 'What I am telling you is true.'" The response could have focused more on explaining the significance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation rather than just providing alternative translations without a clear connection to the original phrase.
