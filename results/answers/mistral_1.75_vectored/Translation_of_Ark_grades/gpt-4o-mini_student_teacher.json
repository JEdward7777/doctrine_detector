  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer contains inaccuracies and lacks proper understanding of the Biblical context. While the student attempted to provide examples of the term \"ark\" in different Biblical contexts, the references to \"Ark of the Lamb\" in Revelation 7:14 are not accurate and do not align with established Biblical interpretations. Additionally, the answer lacks clarity and coherence. The student's response strays from the accurate understanding of the term \"ark\" within Biblical contexts, which is crucial for ensuring proper interpretation of scripture."
