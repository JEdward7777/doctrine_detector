However, there is a lack of depth and specificity in addressing the concern of accurate translation and contextual meaning of the term within Scripture. The response could have delved deeper into how accurate translation and interpretation play a crucial role in understanding the significance of the term \"ark\" in the Bible from a Christian perspective."
