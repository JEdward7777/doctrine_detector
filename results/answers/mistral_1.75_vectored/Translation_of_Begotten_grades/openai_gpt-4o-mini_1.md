## [Answer](../Translation_of_Begotten.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In Christian tradition, "begotten" refers to Jesus Christ as the Son of God. He is considered to be begotten of the Holy Spirit and also of the Virgin Mary. This is a central belief in Christianity, and it emphasizes the importance of Jesus as the Son of God who came to save humanity from sin.

In relation to spiritual rebirth, "begotten" can be understood as referring to the spiritual renewal that comes through Jesus Christ. Christians believe that through faith in Jesus, they are born again into a new life in Christ. This new life is characterized by love, forgiveness, and obedience to Jesus.

The Bible teaches that this new life is not just a spiritual renewal but also a physical one. Christians are called to live a holy life and to serve others in love. This includes loving their neighbors, caring for the sick and the poor, and sharing the good news of Jesus with others.

In this way, being "begotten" in the spirit of Jesus means being transformed into a new person, filled with the love and compassion of Jesus. It is a gift of salvation that is available to all who believe in Jesus Christ.
