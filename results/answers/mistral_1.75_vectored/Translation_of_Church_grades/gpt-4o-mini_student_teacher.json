  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer primarily lists different denominations within Christianity, which does not accurately address the concern of representing the church's inclusive nature in translations. The suggested translations provided by the teacher focus on the broader concept of the church as a gathering of all believers, which the student's list of denominations does not capture. The student needs to focus on translations that convey inclusivity and unity among believers rather than denominational distinctions."
