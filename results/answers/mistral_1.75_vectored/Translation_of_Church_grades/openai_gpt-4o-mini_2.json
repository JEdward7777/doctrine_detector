  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the suggested translations provided reflect a broad understanding of the term \"church\" as inclusive of all believers, the additional translations listed do not directly address the concern of accurately representing the church's inclusive nature. The provided translations focus more on denominational distinctions within Christianity rather than emphasizing the unity of all believers in the body of Christ. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to include translations that emphasize the unity and inclusivity of the church across different traditions and denominations within Christianity."
