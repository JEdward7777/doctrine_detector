For example, equating \"Yeshua\" with \"Yahweh\" is incorrect, as \"Yeshua\" is more commonly understood to be the Hebrew name for Jesus. Additionally, the Greek, Latin, and Spanish translations provided are correct in associating \"Yahweh\" with \"Jesus,\" but the translations for French, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Arabic are inaccurate. The use of transliterations in some cases may cause misunderstandings rather than maintaining the true meaning of the name \"Yahweh.\" The importance of accurately representing the sacred name of \"Yahweh\" should be emphasized."
