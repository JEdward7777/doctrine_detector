  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided translations of the name \"Yahweh\" into various languages, but the translations do not accurately convey the meaning of \"Lord Yahweh\" as suggested in the reference answer. The focus should have been on maintaining the significance of God's title and presence, rather than literal translations of the name itself. Additionally, the translations provided do not align with the Christian understanding of the name \"Yahweh.\" The student demonstrated effort in exploring different language translations, but the answer lacks the depth and accuracy required in translating such a sacred term."
