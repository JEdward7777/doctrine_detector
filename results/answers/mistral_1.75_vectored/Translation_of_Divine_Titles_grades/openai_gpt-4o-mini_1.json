However, the core concern of accurately translating the meaning of God's titles and presence in Scripture is not directly addressed in this response. The mention of the name \"Yahweh\" as \"Lord God\" or \"God who is the Lord\" in the given answer is more reflective of the concern provided. Additional discussion on the significance of accurate translation in reflecting the nature and essence of God in different languages would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
