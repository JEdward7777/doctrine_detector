It simply lists various Bible translations without providing any insight into the accurate translation of 'Hades' and 'Sheol'. Additionally, it does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the biblical meanings of these terms from a Christian worldview. More theological explanation and references to specific biblical passages would enhance the quality of this response."
