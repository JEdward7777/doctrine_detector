  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a list of translations, which is helpful, but did not incorporate the recommended terms provided in the teacher's reference answer. The student should have included translations such as 'place of the dead', 'the underworld', 'the grave', and explanatory phrases to better convey the biblical meanings of 'Hades' and 'Sheol'. It is important to ensure accurate biblical representation in translations for greater understanding among believers."
