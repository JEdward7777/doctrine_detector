  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThis response provides some accurate information about Hades and Sheol, mentioning that they have similar meanings in both Old and New Testaments. It also offers reliable translation options for readers to consult. However, the response could be improved by providing more specific and detailed explanations of the biblical meaning of these terms, rather than simply listing translations.\n\nThe concern about ensuring accurate biblical representation is well-represented in this response, as it provides a helpful list of reliable translations that can aid believers in their understanding of Hades and Sheol. However, the response could be even stronger if it included more analysis or insight into the significance of these terms in biblical theology.\n\nOverall, while the response is solid, it could benefit from more depth and nuance to truly excel in representing accurate biblical representation."
