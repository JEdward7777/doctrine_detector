Firstly, the term \"Holy One\" is not solely a reference to Jesus Christ in Christian theology; it can also refer to God the Father and the Holy Spirit. Additionally, the mention of \"Jesus is referred to as 'Yeshua,' which means 'Yeshua is Jesus'\" in Greek is incorrect. The student should have focused more on the actual translation of the term \"Holy One\" in different languages rather than solely on the name \"Jesus Christ.\""
