Comment: The student provided a good overview of how the term "Holy One" can be translated into different languages, but there is a lack of emphasis on maintaining the theological implications of the term. They should have focused more on retaining the meaning of holiness, which often implies 'God' or 'the Set Apart One,' as specified in the reference answer.
