However, the concern about ensuring accurate representation of the term in translations to maintain theological implications could have been addressed more directly by discussing the importance of conveying the true essence of holiness and divinity associated with the term \"Holy One\" in different languages. A deeper exploration of the theological significance and implications of the term could have enhanced the response."
