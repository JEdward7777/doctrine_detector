The concern about ensuring accurate representation of the term in translations to maintain theological implications is addressed, but there could have been more emphasis on the importance of preserving the concept of holiness and the divine nature associated with the term to align with Christian beliefs. Overall, a solid effort in exploring the linguistic variations while connecting them to theological considerations."
