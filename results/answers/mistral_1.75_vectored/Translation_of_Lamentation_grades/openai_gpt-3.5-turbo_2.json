The connection to prayer, repentance, obedience, love, and evangelism is insightful from a Christian worldview. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the emotional weight of lamentation in the Biblical contexts discussed to address the concern about integrating lamentation into spiritual practices more effectively."
