  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's suggestions are all accurate and capture the essence of the term \"predestined\" from a biblical perspective. They demonstrate a good understanding of the concept and its relationship to God's sovereignty and purpose. However, the grade could be improved by offering more direct translations that align more closely with the reference answer, particularly the suggestions of \"decided long ago\" and \"planned ahead of time.\""
