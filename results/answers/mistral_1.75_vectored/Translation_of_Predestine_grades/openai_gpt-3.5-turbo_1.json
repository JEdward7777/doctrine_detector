  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant translations of the term \"predestined\" but fails to address the concern of ensuring accurate understanding of biblical translations related to predestination. The translations provided do not directly convey the theological concept of predestination as understood in a Christian worldview. More focus on biblical context and theological accuracy would have improved the grade."
