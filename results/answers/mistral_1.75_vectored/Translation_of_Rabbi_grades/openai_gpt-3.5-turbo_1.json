  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response does an excellent job addressing the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. It emphasizes the importance of respecting the title \"Rabbi\" in translations to avoid diminishing Jesus' role as a teacher. The response also considers the cultural and gender-specific aspects of the term while advocating for fidelity to the original text. This demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on translating terms related to Jesus' teaching ministry."
