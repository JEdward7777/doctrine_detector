Grade: 40

Comment: The student provided literal translations of "ransom" in different languages, but they missed the theological depth and nuance of the term. A Christian worldview emphasizes the sacrificial aspect of ransom, which involves redemption and liberation through a payment, rather than just a literal translation of the word. The answer lacked interpretation and cultural contextualization of the term in different languages.
