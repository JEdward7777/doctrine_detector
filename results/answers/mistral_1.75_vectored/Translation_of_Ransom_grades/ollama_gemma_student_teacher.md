**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** While the student provides accurate translations of "ransom" into various languages, the response lacks depth and fails to capture the theological significance of the term. A more nuanced understanding of the concept of ransom emphasizes the action of making a payment to secure freedom, which is crucial for understanding its application in a Christian worldview.
