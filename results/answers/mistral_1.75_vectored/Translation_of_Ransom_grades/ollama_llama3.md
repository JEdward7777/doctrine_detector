## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a score of 40.

While the response does provide translations of "ransom" in different languages, it falls short in accurately conveying the theological significance of the term. The given answer provides more depth and nuance to the concept of ransom, highlighting its connection to freedom and redemption. In contrast, the provided responses simply list the translation without any further explanation or insight.

To improve this response, I would suggest incorporating a brief theological reflection on the meaning and significance of "ransom" in different cultural contexts. This could involve discussing how various cultures understand concepts related to sacrifice, redemption, and freedom, and how these understandings can inform our own interpretation of the term.

Comment: While the response provides some useful information about translations, it does not adequately address the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. To improve this response, I would recommend providing more depth and nuance to the concept of "ransom," as well as exploring how different cultures understand related concepts.
