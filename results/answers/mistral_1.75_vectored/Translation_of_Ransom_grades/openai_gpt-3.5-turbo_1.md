Comment: The response lists translations of "ransom" in different languages, but it does not address the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. The provided translations are literal word-for-word translations, which may not capture the full theological meaning of "ransom." The answer should have delved into the deeper theological implications and nuances of the concept of "ransom" in different languages and cultures.
