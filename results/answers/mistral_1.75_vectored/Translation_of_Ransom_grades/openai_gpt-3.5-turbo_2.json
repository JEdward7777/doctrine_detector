However, it falls short in addressing the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. The answer does not delve into the deeper theological implications of the concept of \"ransom\" in Christianity, such as Christ's atoning sacrifice to secure freedom from sin. It would have been more comprehensive if it connected the translations to the theological significance of the term."
