Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a list of translations of "ransom" in various languages, but it does not address the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. The response lacks analysis or commentary on how these translations may impact the understanding of the theological concept of "ransom." The original answer provided a strong definition of "ransom" but the application and analysis in different languages and cultures were missing.
