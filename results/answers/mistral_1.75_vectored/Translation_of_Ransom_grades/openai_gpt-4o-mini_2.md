Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided a list of literal translations of "ransom" in different languages, but it did not address the nuance or theological significance of the term in each language. The concern was to ensure theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts, which was not fully addressed in this response. The significant aspect of the term "ransom" as 'pay to release,' 'buy back,' or 'penalty paid' was not explored in relation to the translations provided. More depth and analysis based on theological implications would have been necessary for a higher grade.
