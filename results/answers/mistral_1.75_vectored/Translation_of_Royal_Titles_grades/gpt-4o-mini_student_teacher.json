  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided translations in different languages for the phrase \"Your Majesty,\" but the translations did not accurately capture the respect and honor associated with addressing a royal figure. In the context of biblical teachings, it is important to use language that reflects the reverence and deference due to rulers. The translations provided by the student did not fully align with this principle. It would be more appropriate to use translations that convey appropriate respect and honor when addressing royalty."
