**Comment:**

The student's answer provides accurate translations of "Your Majesty" in various languages, demonstrating an understanding of the phrase's meaning and cultural significance. However, it could benefit from a broader range of languages and a more detailed explanation of the variations in translation depending on the context. Additionally, the student's answer does not address the concern related to biblical teachings, which may be relevant for the specific Christian worldview being referenced.
