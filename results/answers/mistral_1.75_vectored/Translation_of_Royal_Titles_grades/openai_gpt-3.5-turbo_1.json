  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides some translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, but it does not directly address the concern of accurate and respectful translations of titles in the context of biblical teachings. It lacks a Christian-specific worldview and does not connect the translations to biblical principles related to addressing authority. Additionally, some of the translations provided may not align with biblical teachings or cultural sensitivities in Christian contexts."
