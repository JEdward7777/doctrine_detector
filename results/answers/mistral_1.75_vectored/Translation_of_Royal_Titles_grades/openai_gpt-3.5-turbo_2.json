  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a variety of translations for the phrase \"Your Majesty\" in different languages but lacks a direct connection to biblical teachings. While it is informative and covers various translations, there is no explicit mention of how accuracy and respectfulness in translations align with biblical teachings. To improve, the response could have included biblical references or principles that emphasize the importance of respectful communication, especially when addressing authority figures."
