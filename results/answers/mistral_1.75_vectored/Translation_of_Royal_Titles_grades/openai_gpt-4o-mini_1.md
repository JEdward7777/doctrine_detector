Comment: The response provides a good overview of translations for "Your Majesty" in various languages and acknowledges the importance of context and consulting native speakers for accurate translations. However, the response does not directly address the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations of titles in the context of biblical teachings. It would have been beneficial to include specific biblical references or principles related to addressing authority figures respectfully, which would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
