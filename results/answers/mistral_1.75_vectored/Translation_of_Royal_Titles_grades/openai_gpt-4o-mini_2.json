  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a variety of translations for the phrase \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, which shows an understanding of the concept of respectful titles of authority. However, the concern specified the need to ensure accuracy and respectfulness in translations in the context of biblical teachings, and the response does not directly address this aspect. The provided translations are not specifically related to biblical teachings or Christian worldview, so the response could have been improved by incorporating how these translations align with biblical principles of honor and respect towards authority figures."
