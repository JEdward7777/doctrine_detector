Although the term \"saints\" is associated with love and protection, its primary biblical meaning refers to all believers who are set apart for God's purposes. The suggestions provided do not fully capture the theological significance of the term. Additionally, the mention of \"Angels of the Lord\" as a translation for saints is not doctrinally accurate as angels and saints are distinct beings in Christian theology. The answer would benefit from a more nuanced understanding of the term \"saints\" from a Christian worldview."
