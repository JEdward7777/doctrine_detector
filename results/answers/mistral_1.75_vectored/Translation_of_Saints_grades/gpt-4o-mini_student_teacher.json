  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "The student's answer provides a variety of translations for the term \"saints\", including some creative alternatives like \"Blessed ones\" and \"Angels of the Lord\". However, the concern specified using inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. The student's answer does not directly address this concern as some of the suggested translations may not fully encompass all believers in Jesus without referencing specific Christian groups. \n\nTherefore, I would grade this student's answer as 75. The student showed an understanding of the term \"saints\" and provided varied translations, but missed the mark on ensuring inclusive language without specific Christian group references. It would have been better to focus on translations like 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus' as the reference answer provided."
