The term "saints" is a Christian symbol of love and protection. It is important to use a translation that accurately conveys this message. Here are some recommended translations:

1. "Saints" - This is the most common and widely recognized translation.
2. "Holy ones" - This emphasizes the sanctification and holiness of the saints.
3. "Blessed ones" - This emphasizes the blessings that the saints receive from God.
4. "Servants of Christ" - This emphasizes the role of the saints as servants of Jesus Christ.
5. "Angels of the Lord" - This emphasizes the heavenly nature of the saints and their role in protecting and guiding us.

It is important to choose a translation that resonates with you and helps you to remember the love and protection that the saints offer.
