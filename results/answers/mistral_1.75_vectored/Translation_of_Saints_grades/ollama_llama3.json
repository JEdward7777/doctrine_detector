  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern of using inclusive language, but it could be improved. While suggesting alternative translations like \"holy ones\" or \"holy people\" is a good start, the original answer only mentions Christian-specific terms (\"saints\") and does not explicitly address the importance of inclusivity. The response also lacks a clear acknowledgment of the need to avoid referring to specific Christian groups. To improve the grade, it would be helpful to provide more inclusive language options that encompass all believers in Jesus, regardless of denomination or group affiliation."
