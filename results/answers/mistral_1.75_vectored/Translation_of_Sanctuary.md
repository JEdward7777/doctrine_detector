## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
When translating the term "sanctuary" in modern texts, it is important to consider its Christian context and its broader meaning. In the Bible, a sanctuary refers to a place of worship and protection, where God's presence is present. This can be interpreted as a physical location, such as a church or temple, or as a spiritual one, such as a prayerful space.

In modern texts, "sanctuary" can also have a broader meaning that goes beyond its Christian context. It can refer to any place or person who provides protection and support, such as a refuge for those seeking help or a safe haven for those in need.

When translating "sanctuary," it is important to consider the context in which it is being used and to ensure that the translation accurately conveys its intended meaning. It may also be helpful to consult with a Christian or other religious leader to ensure that the translation is appropriate and respectful.
