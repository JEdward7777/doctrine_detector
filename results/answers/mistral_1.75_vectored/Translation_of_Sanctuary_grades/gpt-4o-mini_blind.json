  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer a 85.\n\nThe student's answer provides a good understanding of the term \"sanctuary\" both in its Christian context and in a broader sense. They correctly highlight the importance of considering the context in which the term is being used and ensuring that the translation accurately conveys its intended meaning. \n\nOne area that could be improved is emphasizing more on the importance of maintaining the theological significance of the term \"sanctuary\" in Christian texts while also acknowledging its broader usage. Bringing in a deeper theological perspective on the concept of sanctuary within Christianity would strengthen the answer from a Christian worldview.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic but could benefit from deeper theological insights."
