  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation about the term \"sanctuary\" in both its Christian context and its broader meaning in modern texts. However, the student did not directly address the concern of maintaining the original Biblical definition of the term. While the student's answer was informative and insightful, it lacked direct reference to ensuring the accurate translation of the term to maintain its original meaning as specified in the concern."
