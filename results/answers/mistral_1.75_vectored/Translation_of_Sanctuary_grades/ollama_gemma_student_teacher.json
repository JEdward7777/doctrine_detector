  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the Christian context of the term \"sanctuary\" and its broader meaning in modern texts. They provide a clear explanation of its biblical significance as a place of worship and protection, while also acknowledging its contemporary applications. The student's suggestion to consult with a Christian leader for appropriate and respectful translation is also valuable. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on how to reconcile the biblical definition with its potential modern interpretations."
