It also recognizes the broader meaning of \"sanctuary\" beyond its Biblical definition, demonstrating an understanding that the concept can transcend religious boundaries. Additionally, the response emphasizes the importance of considering context and consulting with experts to ensure accurate translation.\n\nThe concern about maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms is well-addressed in this response, as it prioritizes a nuanced understanding of \"sanctuary\" that respects its Christian roots while also acknowledging its potential applications beyond those roots. The only area for improvement would be to provide more explicit examples or illustrations to further illustrate the concept's breadth and depth.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a strong grasp of the concern and provides thoughtful insights on the translation and application of \"sanctuary\" in modern texts."
