  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful consideration of the Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" and emphasizes the importance of maintaining its original meaning in modern translations. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the need to ensure proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more explicit references to Biblical passages or principles that support the definition of sanctuary as a holy and sacred place."
