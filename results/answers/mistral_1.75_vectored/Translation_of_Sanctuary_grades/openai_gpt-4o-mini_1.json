  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response acknowledges the importance of maintaining the original Biblical definition of \"sanctuary\" as a holy and sacred place, aligning with the concern of ensuring proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms. The response also appropriately discusses the broader meanings of \"sanctuary\" in both Christian and modern contexts. However, it could have further emphasized the significance of preserving the spiritual and worship-related connotations of the term in Christian translations."
