The phrase is not specifically tied to the New Testament but rather has origins in the Old Testament, referring to the temple in Jerusalem as the dwelling place of Yahweh. It does not exclusively refer to the Church of Jesus Christ, as mentioned in the answer. Additionally, the explanation of Jesus as the Holy Spirit is misleading as they are distinct persons within the doctrine of the Trinity. The answer would benefit from a more precise explanation of the phrase and its significance within both the Old and New Testaments."
