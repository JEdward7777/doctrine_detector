  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer, while providing some general information about the concept of the \"House of Yahweh\" in Christian beliefs, largely misses the mark in addressing the concern of accurately translating the phrase for understanding today. The student focuses more on the broader concept of the Church of Jesus Christ rather than specifically addressing the translation of the phrase. Additionally, the student does not touch upon the importance of accurately conveying the meaning and significance of worship spaces, which was a key concern. The reference answer provided a more direct and focused translation approach, which the student failed to incorporate effectively."
