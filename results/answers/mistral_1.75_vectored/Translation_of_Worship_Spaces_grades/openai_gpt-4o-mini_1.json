It effectively addresses the concern about accurate translations conveying the importance of worship spaces. The connection to the Church of Jesus Christ and the broader Christian community adds depth to the explanation. However, more direct reference to the importance of the temple in the Old Testament could further enrich the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
