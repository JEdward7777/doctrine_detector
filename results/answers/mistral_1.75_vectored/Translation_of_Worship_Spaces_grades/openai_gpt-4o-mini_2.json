The explanation is well-reasoned and aligns with Christian beliefs. However, the response could have delved deeper into the importance of accurate translations in conveying the sacredness and significance of worship spaces, particularly in relation to the presence of Yahweh. Additionally, incorporating more biblical references or theological insights could further strengthen the answer."
