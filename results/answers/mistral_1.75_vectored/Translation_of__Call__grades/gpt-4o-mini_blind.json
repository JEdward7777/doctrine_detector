  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComments: \nThe student provided some relevant alternative translations, but there are repetitions in their answer. The inclusion of the translation from Genesis 46:3 is correct and aligns with a biblical context. However, the translations provided for Matthew 22:37-40 are not accurate. The phrase \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind\" is not directly related to the phrase \"You must call his name.\" The relevance of the translations should be more carefully considered for doctrinal correctness. There should also be more variation and accuracy in the translations as a whole."
