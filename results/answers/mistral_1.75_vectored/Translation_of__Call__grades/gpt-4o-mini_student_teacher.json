  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided some alternative translations of the phrase \"You must call his name\" in a biblical context, which demonstrates effort in exploring different interpretations. However, the translations provided are not entirely accurate or aligned with the biblical references given. Additionally, some translations are repeated multiple times, which shows a lack of depth and variety in the response. It would have been beneficial for the student to focus more on the nuances of biblical language and how they affect interpretation."
