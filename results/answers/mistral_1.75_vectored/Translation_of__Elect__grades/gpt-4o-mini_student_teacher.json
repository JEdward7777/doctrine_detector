  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how the translation of \"elect\" has changed over time in the Bible and the implications of these translations on understanding Scripture. They compared the usage of \"elect\" in the Old and New Testaments and discussed the different translations in older and modern versions of the Bible. The student also highlighted the importance of being chosen by God and the implications of the translation variations on emphasizing either being chosen for a special purpose or beloved by God. Overall, it was a well-written response that addressed the concern effectively from a Christian worldview."
