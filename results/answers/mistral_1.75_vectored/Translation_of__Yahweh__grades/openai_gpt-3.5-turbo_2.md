## [Answer](../Translation_of__Yahweh_.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Lord is a name that is used in the Bible to refer to God. It is considered to be a more reverent and holy name than other names, such as "Jesus" or "Mary."

The name "Yahweh" is also used in the Bible to refer to God, but it is considered to be a more specific name that is associated with the Jewish people. It is also considered to be a more sacred name that should be spoken with great reverence.

In the New Testament, Jesus refers to himself as "Yeshua," which is a form of "Yahweh" that is used in the New Testament. This shows that Jesus is considered to be a part of the Holy Trinity and is also considered to be a part of the Christian faith.

It is important to remember that both "Lord" and "Yahweh" are used to refer to God in the Bible, and they are both considered to be holy and sacred names.
