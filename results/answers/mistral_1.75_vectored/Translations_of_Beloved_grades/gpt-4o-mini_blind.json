The examples given capture different relationships where love is expressed and received. However, to enhance the answer, it would have been beneficial to include a mention of the Greek word 'agapetos' which is often translated as 'beloved' in the New Testament, emphasizing the depth and divine nature of the love being conveyed in those contexts."
