  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a variety of translation suggestions for the term 'beloved' based on the context of love, which is commendable. However, some of the suggestions may not directly relate to enhancing interpersonal relationships within the Christian faith. The suggestions lack the precision and simplicity seen in the reference answer provided by the teacher. A more concise and focused approach would improve the accuracy and applicability in biblical interpretation and Christian relationships."
