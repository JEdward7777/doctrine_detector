The response could be improved by incorporating more direct biblical references and emphasizing the significance of the term 'beloved' in the context of God's love for humanity and the importance of loving others as Christ loves us. Additionally, highlighting the scriptural basis for such terms as \"beloved child of God\" or \"beloved servant of Jesus Christ\" would have enhanced the response's alignment with a Christian perspective."
