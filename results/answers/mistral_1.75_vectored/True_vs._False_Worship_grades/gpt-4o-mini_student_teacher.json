  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a solid answer by correctly distinguishing between worshiping God and worshiping false gods in terms of honoring and serving Jesus Christ versus someone or something else. However, the student's answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning Yahweh as the One True God and emphasizing the importance of obeying Him in true worship, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. This additional clarification would strengthen the student's response from a Christian perspective."
