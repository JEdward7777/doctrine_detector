  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately differentiates between worshiping God and worshiping false gods. It emphasizes the centrality of loving and honoring Jesus Christ, while highlighting that worshiping false gods involves directing affection towards something other than God. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the nature of idolatry and its consequences. Additionally, it does not explicitly address the concern related to understanding true worship within a Christian worldview."
