## Question [True vs. False Worship](../../../questions/True_vs._False_Worship.md)
What is a difference between worshiping God and worshiping false gods?

## Correct Answer
Worship involves honoring and obeying Yahweh as the One True God, whereas worshiping false gods includes actions that lead away from serving Him, as exemplified by the Canaanites and the Israelites who strayed from God's commands.

## Stated Concern
Understanding true worship is crucial for Christians to ensure they are directing their honor and service to God alone.

## [Answer](../True_vs._False_Worship.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Worshiping God involves loving and honoring Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God, and following His teachings. It also involves loving and serving others as Jesus loves and serves us. Worshiping false gods involves loving and honoring someone or something other than Jesus Christ, such as a person, animal, or object. This can lead to idolization and sinful behavior.
