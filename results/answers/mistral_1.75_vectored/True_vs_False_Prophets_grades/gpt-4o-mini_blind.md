## [Answer](../True_vs_False_Prophets.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible provides several guidelines for distinguishing between a true prophet of God and a false prophet. Here are some key points to remember:

1. Love and obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ is central to being a true prophet. A true prophet will always speak and do what is in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ, who said, "I am the Holy Spirit, sent to be with you until I come again." (John 3:5).

2. True prophets will always speak in the name of Jesus Christ and will always pray in His name. They will also always seek to edify and uplift others, as Jesus said, "Love one another, just as I love you." (John 3:16).

3. False prophets will always speak in their own name and will always seek to glorify themselves. They will also always speak and do things that are contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ.

4. True prophets will always fulfill the Scriptures. The Bible says, "Let us pray for the peace and protection of the holy Christian churches and for the faithful endurance and love and prayers that we may be able to help and edify our fellow believers and that we may be worthy of the prayer of our Lord and of our Savior Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 6:7-8).

5. False prophets will always lead people astray and will always seek to deceive and harm others. The Bible says, "But I am the Holy Spirit, sent to be with you until I come again. (Acts 2:26).

It is important to remember that the Holy Spirit will always guide us in discerning who is a true prophet and who is a false prophet. We should always seek to pray and study the Bible to help us make this discernment.
