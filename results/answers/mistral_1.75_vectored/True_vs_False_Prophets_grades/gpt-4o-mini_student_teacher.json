  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response contains some biblical references and attempted to provide guidelines for distinguishing between true and false prophets. However, there are several inaccuracies and misinterpretations in the response. The student's focus on praying in the name of Jesus, love, and obedience to Christ is relevant but the explanations provided are not entirely accurate. The initial points about speaking in the name of Jesus and glorifying oneself are valid, but the following points lack clarity and coherence. The student should focus more on aligning the criteria with biblical principles accurately and concisely."
