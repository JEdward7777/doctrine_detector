  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response provides some helpful guidelines for distinguishing between true and false prophets, such as emphasizing love and obedience to Jesus Christ, speaking in His name, seeking to edify others, fulfilling Scripture, and leading people astray. These points are biblically grounded and relevant to the concern about discerning true prophetic voices.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by more directly addressing the concern and providing a clear, concise framework for evaluating prophets. The given answer provides a good starting point, emphasizing alignment with God's Word, the nature of their teachings, and the fruits of their ministry. While the response touches on some of these points, it does not explicitly connect them to the concern or provide a comprehensive approach.\n\nAdditionally, the tone of the response is somewhat overly reliant on biblical references, which while relevant, can make the text feel more like a list of proof texts rather than a cohesive argument. A more balanced approach that integrates scriptural support with clear, logical reasoning would enhance the overall effectiveness of the response.\n\nOverall, the response provides some helpful insights and guidelines, but could be improved by more directly addressing the concern and presenting a clearer, more comprehensive framework for evaluating prophets."
