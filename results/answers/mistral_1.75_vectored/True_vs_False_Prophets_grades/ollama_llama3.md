## [Answer](../True_vs_False_Prophets.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible provides several guidelines for distinguishing between a true prophet of God and a false prophet. Here are some key points to remember:

1. Love and obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ is central to being a true prophet. A true prophet will always speak and do what is in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ, who said, "I am the Holy Spirit, sent to be with you until I come again." (John 3:5).

2. True prophets will always speak in the name of Jesus Christ and will always pray in His name. They will also always seek to edify and uplift others, as Jesus said, "Love one another, just as I love you." (John 3:16).

3. False prophets will always speak in their own name and will always seek to glorify themselves. They will also always speak and do things that are contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ.

4. True prophets will always fulfill the Scriptures. The Bible says, "Let us pray for the peace and protection of the holy Christian churches and for the faithful endurance and love and prayers that we may be able to help and edify our fellow believers and that we may be worthy of the prayer of our Lord and of our Savior Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 6:7-8).

5. False prophets will always lead people astray and will always seek to deceive and harm others. The Bible says, "But I am the Holy Spirit, sent to be with you until I come again. (Acts 2:26).

It is important to remember that the Holy Spirit will always guide us in discerning who is a true prophet and who is a false prophet. We should always seek to pray and study the Bible to help us make this discernment.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 70.

The response provides some helpful guidelines for distinguishing between true and false prophets, such as emphasizing love and obedience to Jesus Christ, speaking in His name, seeking to edify others, fulfilling Scripture, and leading people astray. These points are biblically grounded and relevant to the concern about discerning true prophetic voices.

However, the response could be strengthened by more directly addressing the concern and providing a clear, concise framework for evaluating prophets. The given answer provides a good starting point, emphasizing alignment with God's Word, the nature of their teachings, and the fruits of their ministry. While the response touches on some of these points, it does not explicitly connect them to the concern or provide a comprehensive approach.

Additionally, the tone of the response is somewhat overly reliant on biblical references, which while relevant, can make the text feel more like a list of proof texts rather than a cohesive argument. A more balanced approach that integrates scriptural support with clear, logical reasoning would enhance the overall effectiveness of the response.

Overall, the response provides some helpful insights and guidelines, but could be improved by more directly addressing the concern and presenting a clearer, more comprehensive framework for evaluating prophets.
