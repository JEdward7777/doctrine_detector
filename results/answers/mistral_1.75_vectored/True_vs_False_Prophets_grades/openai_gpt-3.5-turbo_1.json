However, the inclusion of specific biblical references and teachings related to prophecy would further strengthen the argument from a Christian perspective. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting key aspects of discernment, but could benefit from more depth and specific scriptural support to enhance the overall clarity and reliability of the discernment process."
