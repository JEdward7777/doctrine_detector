However, the response lacks specific biblical references and depth in explanation compared to the provided response which elaborates on the characteristics and actions of true and false prophets in relation to Jesus Christ and biblical teachings. Further scriptural support and deeper analysis would enhance the evaluation of true prophetic voices."
