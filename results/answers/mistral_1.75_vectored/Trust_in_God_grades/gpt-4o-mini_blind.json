  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response effectively explains the difference between having hope in God and merely wishing for something. They correctly emphasize the importance of a deeper relationship with God, trust in His promises, obedience to His commands, and seeking His will. The explanation provided is doctrinally sound and aligns well with a Christian worldview. A slight improvement could have been made by incorporating more biblical references to support their points further."
