  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good explanation of the difference between having hope in God and merely wishing for something. They emphasize the importance of a deeper relationship with God and seeking His will. However, the response could be more concise and focused on the specific concern of distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking. The student's answer could be improved by directly addressing this concern and providing a more precise comparison between hope in God and wishing for something."
