  "grade_comment": "Grade: 92\n\nComment: The response effectively distinguishes between having hope in God and mere wishing, highlighting the importance of a deeper relationship with God's promises and His will. The writer provides clear examples and biblical support (Matthew 26:39) to illustrate their point. While there is some repetition (\"having hope in God\" is mentioned three times), the overall message is well-organized and easy to follow.\n\nThe response successfully addresses the concern of distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking, providing a clear definition of hope in God and contrasting it with wishing for something. The addition of practical examples (praying, asking for guidance) and biblical references adds depth and authority to the response."
