  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed response citing various scriptures and principles from the Bible on trustworthiness. However, the response was overly complex and did not directly address the concern of encouraging followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability. The student's answer would have been more effective if it had focused on practical examples and applications of trustworthiness in alignment with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
