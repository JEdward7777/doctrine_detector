  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides several examples from Scripture that demonstrate trustworthiness in one's actions, which aligns well with the concern of encouraging followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability. The examples cited are relevant and supported by clear biblical passages, which adds credibility to the response.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the lack of explicit connection between these examples and the definition provided as the answer (i.e., \"A trustworthy person is one who can be depended upon to do and say what is right and true\"). While the examples illustrate trustworthiness in practice, a more direct link to the definition would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the response effectively uses biblical examples to encourage followers to live in accordance with Scriptural teachings on integrity and reliability."
