## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The biblical definition of love is found in 1 Corinthians 13:4-7, which says: "Love is patient, love is kind. It is always done in the Holy Spirit and will help fulfill the greatest commandment of loving one another as Jesus loves us. Love is a gift given to us by the Holy Spirit. Love is a servant who comes before me. Love is a prayer that comes from the heart of Jesus our Savior. Love is a commandment that fulfills the greatest commandment."

In this passage, love is described as being patient and kind, and it is said to be done in the Holy Spirit. This means that love is a gift that comes from God and should be used to serve others.

In addition to these general principles, there are specific forms of love mentioned in the Bible. For example, brotherly love is mentioned in Matthew 22:39, where Jesus teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves, and also to love our brothers and sisters in Christ. This love is meant to be a reflection of the love that Jesus loves us with.

Romantic love is also mentioned in the Bible, but it is not specifically mentioned in the New Testament. However, the Old Testament has many references to love that can be seen as a model for romantic love. For example, the story of Ruth and Naomi in the book of Ruth is a story of love and redemption that can be seen as a model for Christian love.

Overall, all forms of love are meant to be a reflection of the love that Jesus loves us with. They are meant to be done in the Holy Spirit and should be used to serve others.
