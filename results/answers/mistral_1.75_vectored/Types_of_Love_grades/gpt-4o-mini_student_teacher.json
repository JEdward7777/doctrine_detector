  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response by incorporating relevant Bible verses and discussing brotherly love and romantic love in relation to the biblical definition of love. However, the response could have been improved by more directly addressing the concern of differentiating the types of love while ensuring alignment with a biblical worldview. The student could have further emphasized the importance of aligning all forms of love with the principles of God's love, as indicated in the reference answer."
