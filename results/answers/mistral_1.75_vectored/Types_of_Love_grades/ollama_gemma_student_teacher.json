  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical definition of love and its various forms. They provide relevant scripture references to support their claims and clearly explain how different forms of love reflect the love of Christ. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of romantic love in the Bible and its alignment with Christian principles. Additionally, the student's conclusion could be strengthened by reiterating the importance of love as a transformative power in relationships and society."
