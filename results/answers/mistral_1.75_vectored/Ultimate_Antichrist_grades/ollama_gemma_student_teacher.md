The beast in chapter 13 of Revelation is often identified as the ultimate antichrist, who will attempt to destroy Godâ€™s people but will ultimately be defeated by Jesus.

## [Answer](../Ultimate_Antichrist.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The ultimate antichrist in the book of Revelation is Jesus Christ. In Revelation 22:17, it says "I am the Lord Jesus Christ who loves you and wants to be with you always." This verse shows that Jesus is the ultimate antichrist, and that He is the one who will come to fulfill His promise to be with us always.

**Grade:** 0/100

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the book of Revelation and the identity of the ultimate antichrist. Revelation 22:17 speaks of Jesus Christ's love and presence, not His antichrist nature. The correct answer to the question is that the beast in chapter 13 of Revelation is often identified as the ultimate antichrist.
