The answer provided in the original text is biblically accurate, identifying Jesus Christ as the one who will come to fulfill His promise to be with us always. In contrast, this response incorrectly equates Jesus with the antichrist, which undermines the biblical narrative and our understanding of God's plan for salvation. To address this concern, Christians need a clear understanding of eschatological figures like the antichrist, but this response does not provide that clarity."
