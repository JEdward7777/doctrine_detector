This theological misunderstanding undermines the biblical understanding of eschatological figures. Understanding the true nature of the antichrist as an adversary of Christ and being prepared for the challenges related to this figure are crucial for Christians in their faith journey. The response lacks accuracy and clarity in presenting Christian eschatological beliefs."
