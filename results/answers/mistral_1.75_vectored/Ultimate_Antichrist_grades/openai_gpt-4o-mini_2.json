The ultimate antichrist in the book of Revelation is typically understood to be a figure opposing Christ and leading people away from God, not Jesus Himself. It is important for Christians to understand biblical eschatological figures, such as the antichrist, in order to be prepared for the challenges they may face in faith, but this response provides a misinterpretation of the text. The concept of Jesus as the ultimate antichrist is not supported by biblical teachings."
