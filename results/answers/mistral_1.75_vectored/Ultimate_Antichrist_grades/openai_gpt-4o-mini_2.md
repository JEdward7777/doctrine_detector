## Question [Ultimate Antichrist](../../../questions/Ultimate_Antichrist.md)
Who is often identified as the ultimate antichrist in the book of Revelation?

## Correct Answer
The beast in chapter 13 of Revelation is often identified as the ultimate antichrist, who will attempt to destroy Godâ€™s people but will ultimately be defeated by Jesus.

## Stated Concern
Being aware of eschatological figures helps Christians prepare for the challenges they may face in faith.

## [Answer](../Ultimate_Antichrist.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The ultimate antichrist in the book of Revelation is Jesus Christ. In Revelation 22:17, it says "I am the Lord Jesus Christ who loves you and wants to be with you always." This verse shows that Jesus is the ultimate antichrist, and that He is the one who will come to fulfill His promise to be with us always.

Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided is not accurate from a Christian perspective. The ultimate antichrist in the book of Revelation is typically understood to be a figure opposing Christ and leading people away from God, not Jesus Himself. It is important for Christians to understand biblical eschatological figures, such as the antichrist, in order to be prepared for the challenges they may face in faith, but this response provides a misinterpretation of the text. The concept of Jesus as the ultimate antichrist is not supported by biblical teachings.
