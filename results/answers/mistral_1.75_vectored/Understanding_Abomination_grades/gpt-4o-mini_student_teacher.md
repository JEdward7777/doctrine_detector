Grade: 60

Comment: While the student listed some important actions and practices that Christians should engage in according to the Bible, their response did not accurately address the specific actions identified as abominations to God in scripture. The examples provided by the student did not align with the reference answer which highlighted lying, pride, sacrificing humans, idol worship, murder, and sexual sins as abominations to God. The student's answer displayed a misunderstanding of the question and did not effectively address the concern of understanding actions against God's will as outlined in scripture from a Christian worldview.
