The response mentioned common abominations but lacked specific Biblical references to support each point. Additionally, the response did not address the concern directly raised in relation to the original answer. A more thorough explanation with direct scriptural references would have been beneficial to demonstrate a better understanding of God's will in Christian worldview."
