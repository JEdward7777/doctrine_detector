In Ephesians 1:5, the Bible says, "For we are called to be holy and obedient to the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Holy Spirit who has made us holy and has filled us with the Holy Spirit." This verse teaches that being adopted as a child of God means that we have been made holy and filled with the Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ.

It is a gift from God that is available to all who believe in Jesus Christ and accept Him as their Savior.
