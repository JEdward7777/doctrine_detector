  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response repetitively quotes the same verses without directly addressing the concern raised. While it mentions the seriousness of adultery based on biblical teachings, it lacks depth in evaluating the specific impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality. The inclusion of relevant biblical verses is commendable, but the response could have been greatly strengthened by offering more thoughtful analysis and insight into the implications of adultery on these aspects."
