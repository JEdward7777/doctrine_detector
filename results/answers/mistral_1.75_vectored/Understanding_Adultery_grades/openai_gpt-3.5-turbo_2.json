  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response displays a lack of coherence and repetition of scriptures without providing meaningful insight or analysis on the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality as required. There is also a significant amount of repetition in the text which detracts from the clarity and effectiveness of the response. More focus on addressing the concern with relevant analysis and application of biblical principles would significantly improve the grade."
