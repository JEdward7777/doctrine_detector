  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provides some relevant biblical references regarding adultery but lacks coherence and repetition in content, which detracts from addressing the concern effectively. The excessive repetition of Bible verses from the New Testament does not directly address the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality as requested. The response could benefit from more focused and concise explanations tying the biblical teachings to the specific concern raised."
