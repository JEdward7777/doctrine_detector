While \"Amen\" does signify agreement and affirmation, it is more accurately translated as \"so be it\" or \"truly.\" It is not primarily about expressing love and protection, but rather about affirming the prayer's content and surrendering it to God's will. The reference to praying for the Holy Spirit to come upon the person praying is not directly related to the meaning of \"Amen.\"  \n"
