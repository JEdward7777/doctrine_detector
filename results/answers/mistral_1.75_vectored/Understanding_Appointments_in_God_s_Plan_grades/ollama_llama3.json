  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response accurately conveys the idea that being \"appointed to eternal life\" means being chosen by God for salvation, reflecting His sovereignty and grace. The mention of divine selection and grace aligns well with the concern stated in the question, providing insight into the biblical concept of election.\n\nTo achieve a perfect score, the response could further expand on the implications of this appointment, such as the importance of faithfulness and obedience to God's will. Additionally, some minor adjustments to sentence structure or wording might enhance clarity and flow. Nevertheless, the overall understanding of divine selection and grace in salvation is well-articulated, making 90 a suitable grade for this response."
