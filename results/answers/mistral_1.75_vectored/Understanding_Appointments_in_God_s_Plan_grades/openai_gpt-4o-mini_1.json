It appropriately highlights God's sovereignty and grace in choosing individuals for eternal life, reflecting a solid understanding of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The response could have further expanded on the implications of this divine selection for Christian living and evangelism, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern presented. Good job!"
