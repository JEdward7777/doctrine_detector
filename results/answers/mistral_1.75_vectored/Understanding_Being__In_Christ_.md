In Christian theology, being "in Christ" means that a person has been spiritually transformed and made holy through Jesus Christ. This is done by receiving salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, who died for the forgiveness of sins and offers eternal life to all who believe in him.

Being "in Christ" also means that a person is now part of the body of Christ, which is the Church. This includes being part of the spiritual community of believers who are called to love and serve others, as well as to live a holy life and share the message of Jesus Christ with others.

In addition, being "in Christ" means that a person is now protected and blessed by God, and can have peace and joy in the midst of trials and difficulties. It also means that a person is now a new creation, with a new heart and a new purpose in life.

Overall, being "in Christ" is a deep and meaningful relationship with Jesus Christ, which involves being saved, being part of the Church, and living a holy life.
