  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks depth and does not address the concern of understanding proper biblical interpretation and the significance of names in scripture. The student included some relevant information about individuals named John in the Bible, but failed to provide a clear explanation of the significance of the statement \"His name is called John\" in the context of biblical naming. The reference answer provides a more focused and concise interpretation of the biblical passage."
