  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided insightful reflections on forgiveness, obedience, prayer, and self-forgiveness within a Christian context, which are relevant principles. However, the student's answer did not directly address the material consequences of Esau's decision in selling his birthright to Jacob as highlighted in the provided reference answer. It is important to also focus on the tangible outcomes in biblical narratives to fully grasp the implications of choices and their spiritual consequences."
