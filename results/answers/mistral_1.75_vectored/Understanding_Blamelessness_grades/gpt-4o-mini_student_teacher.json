  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of living a life of love and obedience to God in being blameless, their answer fell short in addressing the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context. The reference answer highlights that being blameless does not necessarily mean being sinless, emphasizing the importance of obedience and honoring God wholeheartedly. The student's answer would have been stronger if they had explicitly referenced this distinction in their explanation."
