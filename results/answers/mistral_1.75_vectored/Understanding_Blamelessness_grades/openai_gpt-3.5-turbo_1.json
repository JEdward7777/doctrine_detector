However, the response did not fully address the concern about understanding the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context. The inclusion of various Bible verses related to being blameless before God was helpful, but there was a lack of clarity in connecting back to the distinction highlighted in the concern. A more explicit explanation or clarification on this distinction would have strengthened the response."
