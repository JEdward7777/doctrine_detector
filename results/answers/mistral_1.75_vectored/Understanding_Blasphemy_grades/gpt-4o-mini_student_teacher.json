  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer shows a good understanding of the seriousness of blasphemy according to the Bible and mentions important verses. However, there are several repeated paragraphs in the answer that detract from the overall coherence. Additionally, the answer could benefit from more precise definition and explanation of blasphemy as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
