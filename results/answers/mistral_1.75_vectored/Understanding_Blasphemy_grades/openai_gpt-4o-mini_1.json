  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of blasphemy and its implications within a Christian worldview. However, there is significant repetition of Bible verses and statements without adding new insights or analysis. To improve the grade, the response could have included more depth in explaining how understanding the seriousness of blasphemy can guide Christians in their speech and behavior, and how it reflects the importance of honoring God."
