However, there is repetition of content and the organization of ideas is somewhat confusing. The connection to the concern about understanding the seriousness of blasphemy could have been more explicitly addressed throughout the response to strengthen its coherence and relevance. Additional scriptural references or personal reflections would have enhanced the depth of the explanation."
