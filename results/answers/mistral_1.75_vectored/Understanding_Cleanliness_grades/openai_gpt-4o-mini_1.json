  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively acknowledges the spiritual significance of cleanliness based on the Biblical definitions of 'clean' and 'unclean'. It highlights the importance of moral purity and being set apart for God's service. The connection between spiritual cleanliness and living a holy life is well articulated. The response appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing how understanding this significance can guide believers in their personal and communal lives. However, there could have been more direct references to specific Biblical passages or teachings to strengthen the argument further and provide a deeper Biblical foundation for the discussion."
