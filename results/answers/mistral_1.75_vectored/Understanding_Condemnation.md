## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that condemnation is a serious consequence of sin. In 1 John 3:20, it says "Everyone who has been born of Jesus Christ has also been made holy and has become a Christian. And whoever loves becomes a Christian." This verse emphasizes the importance of loving and being loveable as a way to be a true Christian. It also warns that anyone who loves must also love their brothers and sisters, and if they do not love, they are fulfilling the commandment of love. If we love, we will be saved, but if we love only in name, we will be condemned.

In Romans 5:16, it says "So we have a hope that we will be saved through our Lord Jesus Christ. We are given this hope through Jesus Christ our Savior.
