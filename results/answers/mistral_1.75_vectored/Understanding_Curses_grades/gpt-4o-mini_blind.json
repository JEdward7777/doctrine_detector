  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: The student provided a general understanding of the consequences of cursing others according to the Bible, referencing James 3:10 and other relevant passages. However, the repeated portion of text from Matthew 5:7 detracts from the overall coherence of the response and does not contribute effectively to the explanation. The student should strive for more focused and concise explanations in future responses."
