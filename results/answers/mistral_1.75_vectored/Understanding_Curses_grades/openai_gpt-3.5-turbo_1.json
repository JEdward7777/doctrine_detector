  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response correctly references a relevant Bible verse (James 3:10) that highlights the negative consequences of cursing, the excessive repetition of a section of Matthew 5:7 detracts from the overall coherence and focus of the answer. The excessive repetition does not enhance understanding of the implications of words in alignment with God's teachings. The response could have provided more depth by exploring additional relevant scriptures or providing personal reflections on the importance of aligning our words with God's teachings."
