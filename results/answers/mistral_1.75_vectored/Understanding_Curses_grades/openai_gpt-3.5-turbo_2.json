  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided a strong biblical reference from James 3:10 that highlights the spiritual consequences of cursing and the importance of not letting cursing and blessing come from the same mouth. However, the majority of the response focused on additional biblical teachings on blessing, loving others, forgiveness, and prayer, which while relevant, did not directly address the concern of understanding the implications of our words and their alignment with God's teachings as effectively as the provided answer. The student demonstrated good knowledge of Bible verses but could benefit from more focused application to the specific concern provided."
