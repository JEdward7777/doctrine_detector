  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response starts well by referencing the biblical verse from James 3:10 and acknowledging the negative consequences of cursing. However, the bulk of the response deviates from addressing the concern by repeating the same phrases repeatedly, losing focus on the implications of words in alignment with God's teachings. The repetition detracts from the quality and coherence of the response, resulting in a lower grade. To improve, the student should provide more relevant points related to the concern and avoid excessive repetition."
