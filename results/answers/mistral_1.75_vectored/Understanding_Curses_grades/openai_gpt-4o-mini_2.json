  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response begins well by referencing James 3:10 and highlighting the negative consequences of cursing. However, the continuation of the response veers off track by repeatedly quoting a passage without offering additional insight or analysis. The response lacks depth in exploring the implications of our words and their alignment with God's teachings beyond the initial reference. Encouragement to provide more thoughtful reflection and application of biblical principles would enhance the overall grade."
