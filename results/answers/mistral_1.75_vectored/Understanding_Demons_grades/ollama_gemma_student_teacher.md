In Christian teachings, the term "unclean spirit" refers to a spirit that is possessed by a demon. The Bible teaches that Jesus came to heal and cast out these unclean spirits, which were sent to help fulfill His mission to love and serve all people. The unclean spirit is seen as a sinful spirit that has taken over a person's body and mind, causing them to act in ways that are not in line with God's will. The ultimate goal of Jesus' mission was to cleanse these unclean spirits and restore peace and joy to those who were being held captive by them.
