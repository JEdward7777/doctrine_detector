  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a score of 85. The student correctly mentions key aspects of being a disciple of Jesus such as following His teachings, loving and serving others, spreading His message, and seeking growth in holiness and obedience. However, the response could be improved by emphasizing the importance of repentance, faith in Christ, and the transformational work of the Holy Spirit in the life of a disciple. Additionally, a stronger connection to the sacrifice and redemption brought by Jesus would enhance the answer."
