  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer presents a comprehensive understanding of being a disciple of Jesus by highlighting key aspects such as following His teachings, loving and serving others, spreading His message, living a life centered on Jesus, seeking holiness, and praying for guidance. While the student's response adds more detail compared to the reference answer, it does not directly address the concern of understanding the specific definition and responsibilities of being a disciple of Jesus. Therefore, the grade is slightly lower than perfect."
