  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30/100\n\nComments: The response contains multiple errors and misunderstandings of Christian doctrine regarding God's judgment. It conflates God's judgment with His love, failing to address the justice and holiness aspect of God's judgment. The use of Bible verses is inconsistent and at times misinterpreted. The response lacks clarity and coherence in explaining the difference between God's judgment and human judgment. The student should work on developing a clearer understanding of biblical teachings on judgment and love in the Christian faith."
