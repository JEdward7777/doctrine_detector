The student should have emphasized the divine aspect of God's judgment over human judgment to grasp the distinction fully. The response lacked depth and accuracy in portraying the Christian perspective on this matter. Continuing to study and reflect on the scriptural teachings regarding God's judgment will help in providing more accurate and comprehensive responses in the future."
