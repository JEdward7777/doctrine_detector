  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provided in the graded answer focuses on emphasizing God's judgment based on His love for His people, which aligns with a Christian worldview. However, there is a significant lack of addressing the concern given regarding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment based on righteousness and justice. The response does not adequately address this concern, which impacts the overall grade."
