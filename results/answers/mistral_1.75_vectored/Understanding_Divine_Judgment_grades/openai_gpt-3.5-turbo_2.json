However, it did not fully address the concern of understanding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment as raised in the provided answer. The response focused more on God's love as the basis of His judgment rather than His perfect righteousness and justice, which are foundational to understanding the difference between God's judgment and human judgment."
