  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response correctly acknowledges the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. However, the majority of the response focuses on God's judgment being based on His love, which does not directly address the concern of differentiating between God's judgment and human judgment. There is repetition of content and verses used to support the response, which detracts from a clear and focused answer. The response could be improved by delving deeper into the aspect of God's perfect righteousness and justice in contrast to flawed human judgment."
