However, it lacks a clear understanding of the distinction between God's perfect judgment, which is based on His righteousness and justice, and flawed human judgment. The focus on God's love in judgment overshadows the importance of His justice and righteousness. Integrating a deeper explanation of these elements would have strengthened the response from a Christian perspective."
