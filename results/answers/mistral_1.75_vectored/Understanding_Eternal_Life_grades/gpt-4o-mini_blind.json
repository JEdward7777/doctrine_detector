  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response correctly mentions that eternal life is a gift from God through belief in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and emphasizes the importance of sharing this gift with others. However, there are some inaccuracies in the phrasing and mixing of spiritual and physical aspects of eternal life. The student could improve by focusing on the doctrinal aspects of salvation and clarifying the distinction between spiritual and physical blessings in eternal life according to biblical teachings."
