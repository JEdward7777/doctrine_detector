However, it falls short in directly addressing the concern raised about the importance of understanding how to attain eternal life for spiritual assurance. The original answer about inheriting eternal life through obeying God's laws and having faith in Him does not align with the Christian perspective that eternal life is solely a gift from God through belief in Jesus Christ. Thus, while the response covers important aspects of Christian faith, it could have better addressed the specific concern mentioned in the context of a Christian worldview."
