The provided response stated that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws and having faith in Him, which does not align with the traditional Christian belief that eternal life is solely received through faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. This inconsistency could lead to confusion and potential theological misinterpretations, impacting the essential understanding of attaining eternal life for spiritual assurance within the Christian faith."
