## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible distinguishes between "evil" and "wickedness" in terms of moral character and behavior. Evil is a sin that is done with intent to harm or hurt someone, while wickedness is a sin that is done out of love for sin and hatred for God. Both are considered grave sins in the Bible, but they have different roots and consequences.

Evil is often referred to as a sin that is done with a specific purpose to harm or hurt someone. For example, Jesus said, "I am here to fulfill the Scriptures that were fulfilled in me, that I might be fulfilled in you." (Matthew 26:39). This shows that Jesus was fulfilling the scriptures to help us, even though it meant suffering and death. Similarly, we are called to do good to others and to love our neighbors as ourselves.

Wickedness, on the other hand, is a sin that is done out of love for sin and hatred for God. It is a sin that is done with a desire to please God, but also to please oneself. Wickedness is a sin that is done with a desire to do what is right, but also to do what is wrong. For example, Jesus said, "I am a servant of Christ, who came to fulfill the commandment of love. I am also a servant of the Holy Spirit, who comes to make me holy and help me to love you. I am also a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, who came to serve and love me, and to serve and love you. I am also a servant of the Holy Spirit, who comes to give me strength and help me to love you. I am also a servant of the Holy Spirit, who comes to give me peace and make me holy.
