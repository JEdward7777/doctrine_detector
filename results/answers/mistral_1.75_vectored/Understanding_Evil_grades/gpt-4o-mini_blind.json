  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComment: The answer provided starts off well by attempting to distinguish between \"evil\" and \"wickedness\" in terms of moral character and behavior. However, it becomes repetitive and loses focus, with excessive repetition of a quote by Jesus that does not directly address the distinction between evil and wickedness. The lack of clear explanation and organization detracts from the overall coherence and effectiveness of the response. Additionally, the answer would benefit from more specific biblical references and a clearer delineation of the differences between evil and wickedness."
