  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response lacks accuracy and depth in discussing the distinction between 'evil' and 'wickedness' in the context of biblical teachings. The answer is verbose and includes irrelevant information that does not directly address the concern of ensuring clarity on the moral implications of behaviors and character according to the Bible. The student also misunderstood the definitions of evil and wickedness as presented in the reference answer. More focus and clarity on biblical principles and teachings are needed for a higher grade."
