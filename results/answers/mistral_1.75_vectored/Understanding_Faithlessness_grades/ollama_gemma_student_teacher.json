  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer correctly defines the meaning of \"faithful\" and \"faithless\" in relation to belief in God. However, it lacks the Christian-specific worldview perspective that faith is reflected in moral conduct. The response fails to address the concern of helping individuals recognize the significance of faith in one's moral actions."
