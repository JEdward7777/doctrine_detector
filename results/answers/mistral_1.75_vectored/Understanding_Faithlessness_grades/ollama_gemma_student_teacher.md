**Comment:** 
The student's answer correctly defines the meaning of "faithful" and "faithless" in relation to belief in God. However, it lacks the Christian-specific worldview perspective that faith is reflected in moral conduct. The response fails to address the concern of helping individuals recognize the significance of faith in one's moral actions.
