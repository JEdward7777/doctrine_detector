## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, fear is often used to convey a deeper meaning and can be associated with love and obedience. For example, Jesus said "I am happy that I am fulfilled that I am fulfilling what is written in the Scripture: 'Love me and I will bless you, and I will come to you to help you.'" (John 17:7). This shows that fear is not just about being afraid, but also about showing love and obedience to God.

In addition, fear is also used as a way to protect and guide us. For example, Jesus said "I am sending you into the Holy Spirit who will give you peace and joy beyond what anyone could give me. I am sending you to be witnesses of my love and forgiveness." (Acts 2:39). This shows that fear can be a way to protect and guide us in following Jesus' teachings.

In our daily lives, fear can be seen as a negative emotion that should be overcome. However, in the Bible, fear is seen as a positive emotion that can be used for good. It is important to remember that fear is not sinful, but it is how we respond to that fear that matters. We are called to love and obey God, even in times of fear.
