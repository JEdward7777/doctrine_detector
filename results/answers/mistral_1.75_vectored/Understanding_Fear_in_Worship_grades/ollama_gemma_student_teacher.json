The student accurately points out how the Bible uses fear to evoke a sense of awe and respect towards God, distinct from the common understanding of fear in daily life. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on how the biblical concept of fear relates to the idea of God's sovereignty and justice alongside his love and forgiveness."
