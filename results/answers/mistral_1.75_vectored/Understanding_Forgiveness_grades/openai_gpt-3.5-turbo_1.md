According to Christian teachings, forgiveness is a central act of love and compassion that involves forgiving others as Jesus Christ forgave us. It means recognizing the importance of God's love and forgiveness in our own lives and extending that same love and forgiveness to others. This includes forgiving those who have wronged us, praying for them, and seeking to help and serve them. It also involves asking for forgiveness from others and forgiving ourselves in order to be reconciled with God and others. Forgiveness is not just about forgiving others, but also about being forgiven by God and becoming more like Jesus Christ.
