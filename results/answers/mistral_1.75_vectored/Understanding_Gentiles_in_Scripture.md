## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Israelites had a deep and complex relationship with Gentiles, which was influenced by their biblical teachings and their history as God's chosen people. In the Old Testament, the Israelites were commanded to love and care for all people, including Gentiles (Matthew 22:39). However, they also had specific instructions to be separate from Gentiles and to follow certain laws and customs to protect themselves from being corrupted by them (Acts 13:46-47).

In the early church, the Israelites continued to have these same values and desires. They wanted to share the love and salvification of Jesus Christ with Gentiles, but they also wanted to protect themselves from being influenced by their Gentile neighbors. This led to some conflicts and misunderstandings between the Israelites and Gentiles in the early church.

For example, there were times when the Israelites wanted to make certain rules and regulations that would help them to remain separate from Gentiles, such as requiring Gentiles to be circumcised or to follow certain dietary laws. These actions were meant to protect the Israelites from being influenced by Gentiles, but they also caused tension and conflict within the early church.

Additionally, the Israelites had a deep desire to fulfill the prophets' promises to bless and blessings to the Gentiles. They saw this as an opportunity to fulfill their mission to spread the love and salvation of Jesus Christ to all people.

Overall, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles was deeply rooted in their biblical teachings and their history as God's chosen people. While they wanted to share the love and salvification of Jesus Christ with Gentiles, they also wanted to protect themselves from being influenced by them. This led to some conflicts and misunderstandings in the early church, but it also led to important lessons about love, forgiveness, and unity.
