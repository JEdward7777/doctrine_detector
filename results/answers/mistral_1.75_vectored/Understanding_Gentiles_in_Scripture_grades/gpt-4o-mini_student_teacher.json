  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles and how it affected their relationships in the early church. They effectively highlighted the tension between wanting to share the message of Jesus with Gentiles while also maintaining a separation to avoid being influenced by them. However, the student could have emphasized more on the traditional view of Gentiles as outsiders who could never be God's people, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a solid understanding with room for improvement."
