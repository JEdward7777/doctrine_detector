  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the historical context and theological issues related to the Israelites' perceptions of Gentiles in the early church. It provides a comprehensive overview of the conflicting attitudes and actions that arose within the early Christian community as a result of these perceptions. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific tensions and conflicts that emerged between the Israelites and Gentiles in the early church, and how these conflicts were resolved or continue to influence contemporary Christian thought and practice."
