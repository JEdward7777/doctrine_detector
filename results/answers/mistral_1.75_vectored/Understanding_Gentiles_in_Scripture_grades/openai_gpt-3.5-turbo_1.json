It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the barriers faced in establishing unity between Jewish and Gentile believers. The only aspect that could have been improved is to further emphasize the ultimate goal of unity and reconciliation among all believers in Christ, despite the historical challenges faced by the Israelites in their interactions with Gentiles."
