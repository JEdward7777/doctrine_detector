It appropriately highlights the theme of God's sovereignty. However, the concern raised regarding believers struggling to comprehend the implications of God's sovereignty in their personal lives could have been addressed more directly in the response for a more comprehensive and balanced perspective. Encouraging believers to seek a deeper understanding and trust in God's sovereignty despite personal struggles would have enhanced the response further."
