  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good understanding of the concept of being called by name in a Christian context, emphasizing the spiritual relationship and identity in Christ. However, the answer slightly misses the key point of God's personal knowledge and selection of individuals, which is crucial in understanding the depth of God's intention and care for each person. Encouraging the student to further elaborate on God's personal relationship with individuals would enhance the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
