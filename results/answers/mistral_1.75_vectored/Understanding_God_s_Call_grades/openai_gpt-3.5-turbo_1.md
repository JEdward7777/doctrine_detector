When the Bible says that God has called us by name, it means that Jesus Christ has given us a new identity in Him. He has called us to be His followers and to live according to His teachings. This is a spiritual calling that involves a relationship with Jesus Christ, who loves us unconditionally and wants to guide us on our journey of faith. It also means that we are not just part of a larger community but are called to serve and love others as Jesus did.
