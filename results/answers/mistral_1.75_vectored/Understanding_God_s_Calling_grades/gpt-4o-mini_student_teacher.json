  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a strong understanding of what it means for Christians to be 'called' by God, emphasizing the aspect of serving others, sharing the message of salvation, living a holy life, and being a light in the world. While the student's answer aligns well with aspects of the teacher's answer, it could have further emphasized the idea that being called by God signifies being chosen and appointed for a specific purpose in alignment with His will."
