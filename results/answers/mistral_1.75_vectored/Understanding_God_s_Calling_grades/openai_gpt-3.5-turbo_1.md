For Christians, being called by God means that Jesus Christ has come into their life and has given them a new purpose. This calling is not just about following the teachings of Jesus, but also about serving others in love and sharing the message of salvation with those who need it. It is a call to be a servant and a witness to the love of Jesus Christ. It is also a call to live a holy life and to be a light in the world.
