It demonstrates a good understanding of personal purpose within the context of faith. The language used is clear and aligns well with Christian beliefs regarding serving others, sharing the message of salvation, being a witness to Christ's love, living a holy life, and being a light in the world. The response could be enhanced by further elaborating on how this calling impacts an individual's daily life and decision-making."
