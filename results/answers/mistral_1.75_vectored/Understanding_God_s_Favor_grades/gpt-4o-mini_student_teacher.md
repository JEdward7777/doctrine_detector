According to the Bible, Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men in several ways:

2. Jesus teaches and serves others: Jesus taught the teachings of love and forgiveness, and He served others by healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and washing the feet of his disciples (Matthew 26:26).

3. Jesus died for the sins of all people: Jesus died on the cross to pay the penalty for the sins of all people, so that they could be forgiven and have eternal life (John 3:16).

4. Jesus was resurrected and ascended to heaven: Jesus was resurrected from the dead and ascended to heaven to be with God and to send the Holy Spirit to guide and empower Christians (Acts 2:46-47).

5. Jesus is a symbol of love and peace: Jesus is known as the Prince of Peace and the Son of Love, and His teachings and actions are meant to bring peace and love to all people (John 3:16).

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men according to the Bible through His love, obedience, teachings, service, sacrifice, and resurrection. However, the student's answer does not directly address the concern of Christians emulating these qualities of Jesus to also find favor with God and others. Encouraging the application of Jesus' characteristics in daily life would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
