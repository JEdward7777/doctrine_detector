  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of highlighting several ways in which Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men, including His love and obedience to God, His teaching and service to others, His death for sin, His resurrection and ascension, and His symbol of love and peace. These are all important aspects of Jesus' character that led Him to be favored by both God and others.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by more explicitly connecting these characteristics to the concern about Christians striving to emulate Jesus' qualities. For example, the writer could have emphasized how these characteristics can be applied in our own lives, such as loving and obeying God, teaching and serving others, and seeking forgiveness for our sins.\n\nOverall, this is a solid response that provides a good overview of Jesus' character and behavior, but could benefit from more explicit connections to the concern about emulating Jesus."
