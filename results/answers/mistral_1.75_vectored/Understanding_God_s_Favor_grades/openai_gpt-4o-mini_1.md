Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of how Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men based on the teachings and actions described in the Bible. It effectively connects the qualities of Jesus with the idea that Christians should strive to emulate those qualities in order to be favored by God and others. The only slight improvement could have been a more explicit emphasis on the importance of Christians following in the footsteps of Jesus in their own lives.
