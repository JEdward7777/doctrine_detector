## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, God's glory is a central theme that represents His love, holiness, and righteousness. It is a reflection of His divine attributes and is meant to be a blessing to all who come to Him. The Bible teaches that God's glory is eternal and unconditional, and it is meant to be a source of joy and peace for all who follow Jesus Christ.

In contrast, worldly sources of glory are often based on human values and desires. They can be found in material possessions, physical beauty, or personal achievements. These sources of glory are temporary and can bring temporary happiness, but they are not true and lasting blessings.

The Bible teaches that true glory comes from following Jesus Christ and living a life of love and obedience. This is the ultimate source of glory and is meant to be a blessing to all who come to Him.
