It accurately emphasizes the eternal and unconditional nature of God's glory compared to the temporary nature of worldly sources. However, the response could be improved by providing more specific biblical references to support the statements made about God's glory. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of recognizing God as the source of all true glory and not just Jesus Christ would enhance the theological depth of the answer."
