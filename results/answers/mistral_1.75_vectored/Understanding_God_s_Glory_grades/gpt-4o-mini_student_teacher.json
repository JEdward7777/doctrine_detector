  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student accurately highlights the differences between God's glory in the Bible and worldly sources of glory, emphasizing the eternal and unconditional nature of God's glory. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on the immeasurable superiority of God's glory in value, worth, and majesty compared to any earthly glory, as stated in the reference answer. Emphasizing this unique and supreme nature of God's glory is essential for proper worship, as it reveals His character and presence."
