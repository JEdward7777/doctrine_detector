  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the difference between God's glory and worldly sources of glory from a Christian perspective. They effectively highlight the eternal and unconditional nature of God's glory, contrasting it with the temporary and superficial nature of worldly glory. The connection to following Jesus Christ and living a life of love and obedience as the ultimate source of glory is also well-articulated. The response aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
