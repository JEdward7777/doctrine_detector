## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Will.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Seeking God's will in our everyday decisions means asking Jesus Christ to guide and lead us in the choices we make. It is a prayerful commitment to follow His teachings and commands, to love and serve Him, and to do what is pleasing to Him. This includes seeking His guidance in everything from the most important decisions, such as who to marry and where to live, to the small daily decisions, such as how to respond to someone who has hurt you or how to share your faith with others.

Seeking God's will also involves seeking His forgiveness for any sins we have done, and asking Him to help us to grow in holiness and love. It means seeking His peace and joy in all things, and seeking to be filled with the Holy Spirit so that we can be more like Jesus Christ.

In seeking God's will, we are not only seeking His guidance and protection, but also seeking to deepen our relationship with Him. We are seeking to be more like Jesus Christ, who always sought to do what was pleasing to God, even when it meant suffering and serving others.

It is important to remember that seeking God's will is not just about making good decisions, but also about growing in love and obedience to Jesus Christ. It is a spiritual journey of growth and transformation, and it is a gift to be able to seek God's will in every aspect of our lives.
