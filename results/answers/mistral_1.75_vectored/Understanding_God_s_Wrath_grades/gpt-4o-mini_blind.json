  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response did not accurately address the question regarding the nature of God's wrath and how it differs from human anger. The excessive repetition of a particular phrase from Jesus' words detracts from the coherence of the answer. The student should provide a more focused and concise explanation that specifically addresses the differences between God's wrath and human anger as taught in the Bible."
