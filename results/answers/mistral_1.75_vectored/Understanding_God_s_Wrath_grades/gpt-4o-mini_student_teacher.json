  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response captures some aspects of God's nature and love, but misses the key point about God's wrath being a righteous judgment of sin and not just a reflection of His love. The excessive repetition towards the end detracts from the overall coherence and clarity of the answer. The student needs to focus more on accurately explaining the concept of God's wrath in relation to His holiness and justice."
