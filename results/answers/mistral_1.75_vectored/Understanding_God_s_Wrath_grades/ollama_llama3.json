  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe response starts off well, correctly stating that God's love is eternal and unconditional, accompanied by His holiness and righteousness. However, it quickly takes a turn for the worse with an excessive repetition of \"I am very happy to share this peace with you\" - which seems to be a direct quote from Jesus' teachings in John 16:22-24, but is not relevant to the original topic of God's wrath.\n\nThe response fails to address the concern of understanding that God's wrath is not a fit of rage, instead focusing on irrelevant and excessive repetition. The lack of focus on the actual topic of God's wrath and its significance in relation to human sin means that this response does not effectively communicate the biblical concept of God's righteous judgment.\n\nIn order to improve, this response could benefit from a more concise and focused discussion of God's wrath, highlighting its purpose as a measured response to sin rather than an uncontrolled outburst."
