  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response does discuss God's wrath and its purpose in upholding justice and holiness, which aligns with the given answer. However, the excessive repetition towards the end does not add any valuable insight and detracts from the overall coherence and effectiveness of the response. It would have been better to use that space to further elaborate on how God's wrath is a measured response to sin, as per the concern provided. More clarity and focus on the central theme would have improved the grade."
