  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided does not fully align with the concern raised. While the answer attempts to explain the nature of God's wrath, it lacks coherence and relevance to the concern about God's wrath being a measured response to sin. Additionally, the excessive repetition at the end detracts from the overall clarity and focus of the response. There is room for improvement in connecting the explanation of God's wrath with the specified concern."
