## Question [Understanding God's Wrath](../../../questions/Understanding_God_s_Wrath.md)
What does the Bible teach about the nature of God's wrath and how it differs from human anger?

## Correct Answer
God's wrath is described as an intense, righteous judgment of sin, in contrast to human anger which can sometimes be sinful. It is a response to rebellion against God and is aimed at upholding justice and holiness.

## Stated Concern
It's important to understand that God's wrath is not a fit of rage but a measured response to sin.

## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Wrath.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that God's love is eternal and unconditional, but also that He is holy and righteous. As such, His love is always accompanied by His holiness and righteousness. This means that God loves us deeply, but also wants to make us holy and righteous.

God's wrath is a reflection of His love for His people. It is not meant to harm or destroy, but to protect and restore. Jesus said, "I am very grateful that I have come to help you. I am very happy to be with you. I am very happy to share this blessing with you. I am very happy to share this peace with you. I am very happy to share this peace with you.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response provided does not fully align with the concern raised. While the answer attempts to explain the nature of God's wrath, it lacks coherence and relevance to the concern about God's wrath being a measured response to sin. Additionally, the excessive repetition at the end detracts from the overall clarity and focus of the response. There is room for improvement in connecting the explanation of God's wrath with the specified concern.
