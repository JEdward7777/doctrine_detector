However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the concept of God's unmerited favor, which is central to the understanding of grace in Christianity. A clearer explanation of how grace is freely given by God to sinful humans, irrespective of their actions or merit, would align more closely with the Christian worldview concerning grace as unearned and undeserved favor."
