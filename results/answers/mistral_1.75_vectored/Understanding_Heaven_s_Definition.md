In the Bible, "heaven" refers to a spiritual place where God dwells and where believers are called to go to. It is a heavenly sanctification that is available to all who believe in Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that heaven is a place of eternal love, joy, and peace.

On the other hand, "sky" refers to the part of the earth's atmosphere that is above the ground. It is a physical place that is home to many animals and plants.

In the Bible, there are several references to heaven, including the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:10), the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:10), and the Lord's promise to be with us always (John 3:16).

It is important to note that while both heaven and sky are mentioned in the Bible, they have different meanings and are used in different contexts.
