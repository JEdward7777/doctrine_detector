  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student showed a good understanding of the general concept of heaven and sky in the biblical context. They correctly mentioned the spiritual significance of heaven as where God dwells and believers aspire to go, and distinguished it from the physical sky above the earth. However, the student could have provided more specific biblical references to support their points and delved deeper into the theological implications and significance of heaven and sky in relation to God's nature and our relationship with Him."
