  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical definitions of \"heaven\" and \"sky,\" clearly distinguishing between the spiritual and physical realms. The response provides relevant scriptural references to support the definitions and acknowledges the different contexts in which these terms are used in the Bible. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the concept of \"heavens\" as encompassing celestial bodies."
