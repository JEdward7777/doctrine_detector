## Question [Understanding Heaven's Definition](../../../questions/Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md)
What is the biblical definition of 'heaven' and how does it differ from 'sky'?

## Correct Answer
In the Bible, 'heaven' usually refers to where God lives, while 'sky' refers to the blue expanse above the earth. The term 'heavens' encompasses everything above the earth, including celestial bodies like the sun and stars.

## Stated Concern
It's essential to understand the different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture, as they can impact our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, "heaven" refers to a spiritual place where God dwells and where believers are called to go to. It is a heavenly sanctification that is available to all who believe in Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that heaven is a place of eternal love, joy, and peace.

On the other hand, "sky" refers to the part of the earth's atmosphere that is above the ground. It is a physical place that is home to many animals and plants.

In the Bible, there are several references to heaven, including the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:10), the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:10), and the Lord's promise to be with us always (John 3:16).

It is important to note that while both heaven and sky are mentioned in the Bible, they have different meanings and are used in different contexts.
