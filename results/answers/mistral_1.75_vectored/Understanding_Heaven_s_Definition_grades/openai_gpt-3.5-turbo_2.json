  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately differentiates between the terms \"heaven\" and \"sky\" based on a Christian worldview, incorporating the concept of 'heavens' to encompass celestial bodies as well. The explanation aligns well with the concern provided, highlighting the importance of understanding these terms in Scripture for a deeper understanding of God's nature and relationship with Him. The response could have been improved by including more specific biblical references and elaborating further on the implications of these terms in Christian theology."
