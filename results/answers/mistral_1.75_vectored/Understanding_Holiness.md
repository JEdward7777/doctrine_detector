Being absolutely holy means that God is perfect in His love, grace, and righteousness. He is always pure and sinless, and He loves us unconditionally. This love is a reflection of His holiness, and it is meant to guide us to become more like Jesus Christ, who is also holy.

As we follow Jesus, we are called to live a life that is pleasing to God, which involves loving others as He loves us. We are also called to repent of our sins and seek forgiveness through Jesus Christ.

Being holy also means that we are called to be holy in spirit, mind, and body. This includes praying and studying the Bible, serving others, and living a life that reflects the love and holiness of Jesus Christ.

In addition to being a call to live a holy life, being holy also means that we can have peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. As we surrender ourselves to Jesus Christ, we receive the Holy Spirit to help us live a holy life and to give us peace and joy in the midst of trials and difficulties.

Overall, being holy is an important part of our relationship with God. It is a call to live a life that is pleasing to God and to be filled with the love and holiness of Jesus Christ.
