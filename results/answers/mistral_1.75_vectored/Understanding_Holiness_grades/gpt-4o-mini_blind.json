  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of God's holiness and its implications on our relationship with Him. They correctly mention aspects such as God's perfection, purity, and love. However, the answer lacks depth in discussing the unique and sacred nature of God's holiness and how it necessitates our repentance and reliance on Christ's sacrifice for forgiveness. The student could improve by emphasizing the importance of God's holiness in shaping our understanding of sin, the need for redemption, and our pursuit of sanctification through the power of the Holy Spirit. Additionally, they can connect the concept of God's holiness with themes such as justice, mercy, and the sacrificial atonement of Christ."
