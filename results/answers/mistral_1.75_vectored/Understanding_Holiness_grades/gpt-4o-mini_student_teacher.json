  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that emphasizes the importance of holiness in our relationship with God. However, there is a concern that the answer does not fully address the idea that God's absolute holiness means we cannot approach Him without His allowance due to our sinful nature. It is essential to recognize the significance of God's holiness in light of our sinfulness and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ. Further elaboration on this point would enhance the overall response."
