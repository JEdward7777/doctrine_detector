  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of God's absolute holiness and its implications for our relationship with Him. The response clearly articulates that God's holiness involves His perfection in love, grace, and righteousness, and that this love is meant to transform believers. The student also acknowledges the need for repentance and forgiveness through Jesus Christ. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the idea of approaching a holy God, potentially referencing the need for humility and reliance on God's grace."
