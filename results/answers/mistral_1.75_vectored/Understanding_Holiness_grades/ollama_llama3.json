  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by reflecting on the concept of holiness in relation to our own lives and relationship with God. The author provides a clear explanation of what it means for God to be absolutely holy, and how that relates to our own calling to live a holy life.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly addressing the question and concern. While the author mentions that being holy is an important part of our relationship with God, they do not directly address the issue of approaching a holy God. The response could also benefit from more specific examples or illustrations of what it means to live a holy life.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the concept of holiness and its relevance to our daily lives, but could be strengthened by further development and connection to the question and concern.\n\nComment: This response shows a good understanding of God's absolute holiness and its implications for our own lives. However, it could be improved by more explicitly addressing the question and concern, and providing specific examples or illustrations of what it means to live a holy life."
