  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of God's absolute holiness and the implications for approaching Him in light of our sinful nature. It emphasizes the need for repentance, forgiveness through Jesus Christ, and living a life reflective of Christ's holiness. The response effectively addresses the concern raised regarding reflection on our own holiness and the steps needed to approach a holy God. However, to improve, it could have incorporated more specific references to biblical passages supporting the concepts discussed."
