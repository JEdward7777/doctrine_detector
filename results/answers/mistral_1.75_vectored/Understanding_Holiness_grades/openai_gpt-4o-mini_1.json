It acknowledges the separation caused by sin and emphasizes the need for God's allowance for approaching Him. The explanation of living a holy life and seeking forgiveness through Jesus Christ aligns well with the concern provided. However, it could have delved deeper into the concept of our own holiness through sanctification and the role of Jesus as the bridge between our sinful nature and God's absolute holiness."
