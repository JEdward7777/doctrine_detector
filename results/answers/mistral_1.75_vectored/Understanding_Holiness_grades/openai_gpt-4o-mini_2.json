It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of reflecting on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God. The discussion on living a holy life, seeking forgiveness through Jesus Christ, and being filled with the Holy Spirit adds depth and relevance to the overall reflection. However, it could further elaborate on the significance of Christ's atonement in bridging the gap between our sinfulness and God's holiness."
