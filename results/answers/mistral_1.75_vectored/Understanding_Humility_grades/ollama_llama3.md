To humble oneself before God also means putting others before ourselves and serving them in love and compassion. This includes loving and caring for those who are poor, sick, and suffering, and seeking to serve others in the name of Jesus Christ. It also involves praying and asking for guidance and strength to help us live a life that pleases God.
