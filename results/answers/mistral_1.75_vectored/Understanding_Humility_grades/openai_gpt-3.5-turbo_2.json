The expansion on how this involves serving others in love, seeking guidance through prayer, and being obedient to Jesus Christ further enhances the understanding of humility in a Christian context. However, there could be more emphasis on how humility leads to a deeper relationship with God and a greater dependence on Him for guidance and strength in living a life that aligns with His will."
