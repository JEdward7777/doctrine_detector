It also highlights serving others in love and compassion as a manifestation of humility. However, it could have delved deeper into how humility impacts one's relationship with God, specifically in terms of surrendering one's will to God and acknowledging His greatness. More direct integration of biblical references or theological insights could have strengthened the response further. Overall, a solid explanation with room for deeper theological exploration."
