In the Bible, there are several terms that are used to describe Christian virtues and sins. Here are some of the most important ones:

1. Sin: This is a general term that refers to any act that goes against God's will. It includes all acts of love and obedience that we do to Jesus Christ, as well as all acts of love and obedience that we do to our fellow Christians.
2. Iniquity: This is a more specific term that refers to a serious sin that involves breaking one of the Ten Commandments or other important commands from the Bible. It also includes acts of love and obedience that are done with a heart of love and obedience.
3. Transgression: This is another term that refers to a sin that has been committed. It can be a sin that was done intentionally or unintentionally, and it can be a sin that was done in love and obedance to God.

It's important to remember that all of these terms are related to the Holy Scriptures and should be used in accordance with the teachings of the Bible.
