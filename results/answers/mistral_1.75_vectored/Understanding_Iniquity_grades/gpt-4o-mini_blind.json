  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The answer provided shows a basic understanding of the terms sin, iniquity, and transgression. However, there are inaccuracies in the definitions provided. The terms are not differentiated clearly and accurately. It is important to have a more precise understanding of these terms based on biblical teachings. Additionally, the explanation lacks depth and scriptural references to support the definitions given. The student could improve their answer by providing more accurate and scripturally supported definitions of sin, iniquity, and transgression."
