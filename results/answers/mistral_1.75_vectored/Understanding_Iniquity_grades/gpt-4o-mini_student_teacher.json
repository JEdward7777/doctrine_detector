  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of sin, iniquity, and transgression, but lacks specificity and accuracy in defining each term according to a Christian worldview. The student's definition of iniquity is somewhat accurate but could be clearer. The explanations for sin and transgression are somewhat confusing and do not align perfectly with the Christian distinction between the three terms. Further clarification and alignment with the teacher's reference answer would improve the grade."
