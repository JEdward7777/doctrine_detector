## Question [Understanding Iniquity](../../../questions/Understanding_Iniquity.md)
What is the biblical distinction between iniquity, sin, and transgression?

## Correct Answer
Iniquity refers more specifically to deliberate acts of wrongdoing or great wickedness, while sin encompasses a broader range of moral failings, and transgression involves violating a command or law.

## Stated Concern
Understanding these distinctions can help Christians better recognize the gravity of their actions and seek repentance.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Iniquity.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, there are several terms that are used to describe Christian virtues and sins. Here are some of the most important ones:

1. Sin: This is a general term that refers to any act that goes against God's will. It includes all acts of love and obedience that we do to Jesus Christ, as well as all acts of love and obedience that we do to our fellow Christians.
2. Iniquity: This is a more specific term that refers to a serious sin that involves breaking one of the Ten Commandments or other important commands from the Bible. It also includes acts of love and obedience that are done with a heart of love and obedience.
3. Transgression: This is another term that refers to a sin that has been committed. It can be a sin that was done intentionally or unintentionally, and it can be a sin that was done in love and obedance to God.

It's important to remember that all of these terms are related to the Holy Scriptures and should be used in accordance with the teachings of the Bible.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 65

Comment: The student's answer provides a general understanding of sin, iniquity, and transgression, but lacks specificity and accuracy in defining each term according to a Christian worldview. The student's definition of iniquity is somewhat accurate but could be clearer. The explanations for sin and transgression are somewhat confusing and do not align perfectly with the Christian distinction between the three terms. Further clarification and alignment with the teacher's reference answer would improve the grade.
