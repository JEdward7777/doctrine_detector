They correctly identify that sin is a general term encompassing any act against God's will, while iniquity refers to more serious sins that violate specific commands. Additionally, the student correctly points out that transgression involves violating a command or law. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a deeper exploration of the nuances of each term within the Christian worldview. Including specific biblical examples or references would also enhance the comprehensiveness of the response."
