  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately explains the distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression in a Christian context, showing a clear understanding of the different nuances of these terms. The provided information aligns well with Christian teachings on moral accountability and repentance. However, the response could have been enhanced by incorporating scriptural references to demonstrate the biblical basis for these distinctions. Overall, a solid explanation from a Christian worldview."
