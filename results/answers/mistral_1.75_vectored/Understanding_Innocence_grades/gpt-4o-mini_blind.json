However, it lacks depth and could benefit from more specific biblical references and theological explanations to support the points made. Additionally, the phrase \"innocent until innocent\" is unclear and does not align well with the traditional concept of \"innocent until proven guilty.\" The answer could be improved by refining these aspects."
