  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a good overview of the Holy Spirit's role in prayer and intercession according to various Bible verses, but the response lacked focus on the specific aspect of the Holy Spirit interceding for us by praying to God on our behalf. It would have been stronger if it had directly addressed this key aspect emphasized in the reference answer."
