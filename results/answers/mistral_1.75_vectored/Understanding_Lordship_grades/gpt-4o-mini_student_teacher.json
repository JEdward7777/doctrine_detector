  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides some correct information about the term 'Lord' in relation to Jesus and God, acknowledging it as a title of reverence and respect. However, the answer fails to fully grasp the significance of the term in conveying Jesus' divinity. The student should focus on emphasizing that the term 'Lord' signifies ownership and authority, specifically in recognizing Jesus as God. Further explanation and clarification are needed to align more closely with a Christian-specific worldview."
