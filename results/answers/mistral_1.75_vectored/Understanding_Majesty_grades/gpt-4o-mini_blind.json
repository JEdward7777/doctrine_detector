Majesty refers to God's sovereignty, greatness, grandeur, and splendor. The answer confuses the term \"majesty\" with other attributes of God such as love and humility. The reference to the Holy Spirit as a symbol of majesty is also not accurate. It is important for the student to study and understand the attributes of God more deeply in order to provide a correct theological explanation."
