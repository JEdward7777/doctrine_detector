  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks an understanding of the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's character and His attributes. While the student mentions Christian virtues and symbols related to Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, they do not address the concept of God's greatness and sovereignty over creation, which is essential in understanding the term \"majesty\" in this context. The answer does not align with a Christian worldview focused on God's attributes and His supreme authority."
