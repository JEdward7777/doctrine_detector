In the New Testament, "perish" is used to refer to spiritual salvation and eternal life. It means to be saved from sin and its consequences, which includes eternal life in heaven with Jesus Christ. This is a spiritual blessing that is available to all who believe in Jesus Christ and accept Him as their Lord and Savior. The Bible teaches that Jesus came to save us from our sins and to give us eternal life (John 3:16).

Comment: The student's answer presents a generally accurate understanding of the concept of "perish" in a spiritual sense according to the New Testament. The reference to being saved from sin and its consequences aligns with Christian doctrine. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to also mention the consequence of eternal separation from God as part of perishing. Additionally, providing more references beyond John 3:16 could further strengthen the answer.
