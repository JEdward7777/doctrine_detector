  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer is partially correct in mentioning spiritual salvation and eternal life, but it falls short in addressing the key aspect of spiritual separation from God. The student correctly identifies that belief in Jesus Christ is essential for salvation, but the focus should be on the consequences of rejecting Jesus, leading to spiritual separation from God. The answer could be improved by emphasizing the significance of rejecting Jesus as the cause of perishing in a spiritual sense."
