In the New Testament, "perish" is used to refer to spiritual salvation and eternal life. It means to be saved from sin and its consequences, which includes eternal life in heaven with Jesus Christ. This is a spiritual blessing that is available to all who believe in Jesus Christ and accept Him as their Lord and Savior. The Bible teaches that Jesus came to save us from our sins and to give us eternal life (John 3:16).

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of what it means to "perish" spiritually, emphasizing the idea of being lost or separated from God due to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation. However, it could be strengthened by delving deeper into the implications of this spiritual separation, such as the eternal consequences and the absence of fellowship with God. Further exploration of the consequences and impact of spiritual separation would have enhanced the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
