In the New Testament, "perish" is used to refer to spiritual salvation and eternal life. It means to be saved from sin and its consequences, which includes eternal life in heaven with Jesus Christ. This is a spiritual blessing that is available to all who believe in Jesus Christ and accept Him as their Lord and Savior.
