However, the explanation lacks depth and does not delve into the theological implications of propitiation and the atonement theory. It would benefit from incorporating more scriptural references and doctrinal insights to strengthen the argument. Additionally, the response could have emphasized more on the necessity of Jesus' sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins and the restoration of humanity's relationship with God."
