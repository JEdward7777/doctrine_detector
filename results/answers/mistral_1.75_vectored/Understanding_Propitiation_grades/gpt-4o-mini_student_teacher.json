  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good explanation of the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in fulfilling Old Testament prophecies and as a demonstration of His love for humanity. However, the student did not sufficiently address the concern of how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy. The reference answer makes it clear that Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath, which was not explicitly addressed in the student's response. A stronger connection between Jesus' sacrifice and the justice and mercy of God would have improved the student's answer."
