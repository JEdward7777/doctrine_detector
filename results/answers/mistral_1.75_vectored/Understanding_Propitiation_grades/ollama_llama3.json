While the response mentions that Jesus' sacrifice fulfilled the ultimate purpose of the Old Testament sacrificial system, it does not explicitly connect this fulfillment to God's justice and mercy.\n\nThe response also fails to fully address the concern of ensuring a clear understanding of how propitiation relates to God's justice and mercy. While it is mentioned that Jesus' sacrifice satisfied God's justice and appeased His wrath, this connection could be further explored and explained.\n\nOverall, the response provides some good information about Jesus' sacrifice and its significance in relation to propitiation, but it could be improved by providing more depth and clarity on these topics."
