It emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice as not only a means of satisfying God's justice and appeasing His wrath but also as a demonstration of love, redemption, and salvation for all. The inclusion of Old Testament prophecies and the universal scope of Jesus' sacrifice further enhances the understanding of how propitiation is intricately connected to God's justice and mercy."
