  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer touches on some aspects of purification in the Old Testament, such as the use of water and the importance of the Bible, but fails to directly address how the process of ritual purification reflects God\u2019s standards for holiness and the nature of sin. The answer also lacks depth and specific examples related to ritual uncleanness and sacrifices as outlined in the reference answer. Further development and alignment with the Christian worldview would significantly improve the grade."
