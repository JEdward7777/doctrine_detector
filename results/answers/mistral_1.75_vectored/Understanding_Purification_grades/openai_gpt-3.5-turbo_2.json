It acknowledges the importance of cleansing from sin, which aligns with God's standards for holiness. The integration of the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate purifier is a strong addition. However, the response could benefit from further emphasis on how ritual purification in the Old Testament demonstrated God's standards for holiness and reflected the nature of sin more explicitly."
