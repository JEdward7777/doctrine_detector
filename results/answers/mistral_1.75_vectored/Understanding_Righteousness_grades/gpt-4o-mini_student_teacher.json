  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid understanding of God's righteousness by emphasizing His holiness, faithfulness, love, and the implications of His righteousness on His actions towards humanity. The student correctly connects God's righteousness to concepts like forgiveness, judgment, and salvation through Jesus Christ. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in not explicitly mentioning the aspect of God's righteousness necessitating the condemnation of sin. Clarifying this connection would further enhance the student's response."
