To describe God as "righteous" means that He is holy and pure, and always acts in accordance with His divine love and commands. It also means that He is faithful to His promises and will always do what is right and good. This includes loving and protecting His people, forgiving those who repent of their sins, and judging those who have done wrong.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student's answer provides a solid understanding of God's righteousness by emphasizing His holiness, faithfulness, love, and the implications of His righteousness on His actions towards humanity. The student correctly connects God's righteousness to concepts like forgiveness, judgment, and salvation through Jesus Christ. However, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer in not explicitly mentioning the aspect of God's righteousness necessitating the condemnation of sin. Clarifying this connection would further enhance the student's response.
