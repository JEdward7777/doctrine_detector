## [Answer](../Understanding_Righteousness.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
To describe God as "righteous" means that He is holy and pure, and always acts in accordance with His divine love and commands. It also means that He is faithful to His promises and will always do what is right and good. This includes loving and protecting His people, forgiving those who repent of their sins, and judging those who have done wrong. In the Bible, Jesus Christ is also referred to as the "Righteous Savior," who came to save us from our sins and make us right with God.
