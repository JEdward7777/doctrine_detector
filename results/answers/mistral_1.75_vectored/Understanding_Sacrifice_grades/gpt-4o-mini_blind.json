The student provided relevant biblical references to support their explanation. However, they could have delved deeper into the theological significance of Jesus being the ultimate sacrificial Lamb and how His sacrifice atones for the sins of humanity. Expanding on the concept of substitutionary atonement and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies would have strengthened the answer. Overall, a solid foundation was laid, but further theological depth would have enhanced it."
