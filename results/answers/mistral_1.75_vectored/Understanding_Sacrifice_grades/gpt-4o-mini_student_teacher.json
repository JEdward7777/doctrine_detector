  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of why Jesus is referred to as the Lamb of God, incorporating various biblical references. However, the answer strayed a bit from the focus on Jesus being a perfect and unblemished sacrifice akin to the sacrificial lambs in the Old Testament. Encouraging the student to more closely align their response with the specific concern provided would strengthen the explanation from a Christian worldview perspective."
