## [Answer](../Understanding_Sacrifice.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Jesus is referred to as the Lamb of God because He is seen as the ultimate sacrifice and fulfillment of the sacrificial Lambs that were offered in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the Lamb of God who came to save the world (John 1:6). He is also referred to as the Lamb of Christ (Ephesians 2:7), Lamb of love (Revelation 3:4), Lamb of peace (Revelation 5:6), Lamb of salvation (Revelation 7:14), Lamb of the Lambs (Revelation 13:10), Lamb of the Lambs who was given to me (Revelation 13:14). Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is seen as a fulfillment of the sacrificial Lambs that were offered in the Old Testament, and His love and forgiveness are seen as a fulfillment of the Lamb's love and sacrifice.
