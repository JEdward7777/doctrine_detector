  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the significance of Jesus being referred to as the \"Lamb of God\" in relation to His sacrificial role in redeeming humanity, aligning well with the Christian belief in Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice. The additional references to various biblical passages enrich the explanation and demonstrate a solid understanding of the topic, addressing the concern from a Christian perspective. The response could have further emphasized the connection between Jesus as the Lamb of God and the concept of atonement within Christian theology to strengthen the explanation even more."
