## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20/100

Comments: The student's response is incorrect and misrepresents the Christian view of Satan. In Christian theology, Satan is not a symbol of Jesus' victory over sin and evil but is considered a fallen angel who rebelled against God and continues to tempt and deceive humanity. The student's answer lacks doctrinal accuracy and does not reflect the Christian understanding of Satan.
