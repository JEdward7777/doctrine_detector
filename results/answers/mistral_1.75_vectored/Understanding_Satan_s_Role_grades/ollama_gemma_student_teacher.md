## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** While the student's answer correctly suggests the symbolic relationship between Satan and Jesus' victory, it lacks the theological depth required to address the specific concern regarding Satan as an adversary in spiritual warfare. The answer would benefit from further elaboration on the concept of spiritual warfare and how it relates to Satan's opposition to God and believers.
