However, the initial response of viewing Satan as a symbol of Jesus' victory over sin and evil does not align with the understanding of Satan as a true adversary in spiritual warfare. The explanation lacks depth in connecting the meaning of Satan's name to his role in opposing God and His creations, which is crucial for Christians to understand the spiritual battle. More specific explanation and connection to Christian beliefs regarding Satan's role as an adversary would have strengthened the response."
