## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response contains significant repetitive and unrelated content which detracts from the accuracy and relevance of the answer. The definition of "Shaddai" as "I am the Lord" is incorrect. "Shaddai" is commonly understood to mean "Almighty" or "All-Sufficient." The misuse of biblical passages also indicates a lack of understanding of the topic. Additionally, the excessive repetition of phrases detracts from the clarity and coherence of the response. An improvement in accuracy, relevance, and coherence is needed for a higher grade.
