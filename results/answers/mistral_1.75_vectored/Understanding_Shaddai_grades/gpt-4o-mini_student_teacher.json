  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer lacks accuracy and coherence with the given question and concern. The response provided contains repetitive and irrelevant content that does not address the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. Additionally, the student's answer does not accurately explain the meaning of the Hebrew term 'Shaddai' nor its significance in the context of the Old Testament. There is a heavy amount of unrelated text spreading across the response, indicating a lack of understanding and focus on the topic at hand. The student needs to significantly improve their understanding and ability to provide relevant and concise answers reflecting the Christian worldview."
