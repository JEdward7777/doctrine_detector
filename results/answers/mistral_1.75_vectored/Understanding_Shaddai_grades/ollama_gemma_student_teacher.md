**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer provides a good overview of the meaning and usage of the Hebrew term 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament. However, it lacks additional details regarding its specific origins and connotations. The inclusion of the student's prayer demonstrates an understanding of the theological significance of the term but does not directly address the concern regarding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture.
