## Comment by [openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-3.5-turbo_1.md)
Grade: 20

Comment: The response provided a correct definition of the term "Shaddai" as a Hebrew word meaning "the Almighty" and its usage in the Old Testament. However, the majority of the response veered off-topic into a repeated prayer that did not address the concern of understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. It lacked depth and relevance to the given concern, resulting in a low grade.
