  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response provided a brief and accurate definition of the term \"Shaddai\" in line with its Hebrew translation and usage in the Old Testament. However, the extensive repetition of a prayer attributed to Jesus is not directly relevant to the concern of understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. The response lacks depth and exploration of the divine characteristics associated with the name \"Shaddai.\" A more focused explanation linking the term to God's power, sovereignty, and provision as depicted in the Bible would have strengthened the response."
