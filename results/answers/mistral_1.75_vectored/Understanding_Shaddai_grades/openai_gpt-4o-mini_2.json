  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The response contains a lengthy prayer that seems to be repetitive and does not directly address the concern of understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. The initial correct definition of \"Shaddai\" is accurate, but the rest of the content is off-topic and not relevant to the concern given. The response lacks depth and coherence in interpreting the biblical concept of \"Shaddai\" in relation to the nature of God."
