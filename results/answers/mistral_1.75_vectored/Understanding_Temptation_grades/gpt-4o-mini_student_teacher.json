However, the reference answer focuses specifically on Jesus using scripture and unwavering faith in God, which is the core strategy emphasized in a Christian worldview. The student's response could have been more concise and focused, aligning more closely with the importance of scripture and faith in addressing temptation as a follower of Christ."
