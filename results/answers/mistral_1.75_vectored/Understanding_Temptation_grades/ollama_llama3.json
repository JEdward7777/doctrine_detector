However, it does not explicitly mention Jesus' ultimate sacrifice as an example of resisting temptation.\n\nThe answer provided is also somewhat superficial in that it only mentions \"scripture\" and \"unwavering faith,\" without elaborating on the specific ways in which Jesus used these tools to resist Satan's temptations. Nevertheless, the response shows a good understanding of the importance of prayer and scripture in one's walk with God.\n\nIn terms of how this response addresses the concern of combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ, it provides some useful insights into Jesus' approach to resisting temptation, which can be applied to one's own life. However, it could have been more explicitly connected to daily life and provided more practical advice on how to put these strategies into practice.\n\nOverall, the response is good but not outstanding in its ability to address the concern of combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ."
