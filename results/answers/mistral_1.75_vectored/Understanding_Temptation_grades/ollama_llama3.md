## [Answer](../Understanding_Temptation.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Jesus used several strategies to resist the temptations presented by Satan. These include:

1. Prayer and Scripture: Jesus prayed and quoted scripture to help him stay focused on God's will. He also used the Bible as a guide for his actions, using it to help him make decisions that were in line with God's teachings.

2. Love and Obedience: Jesus' love for God was central to everything he did. He always put God's will above all else, even when it meant suffering and persecution.

3. Holy Spirit Guidance: Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit, which helped him to discern what was right and what was wrong. The Holy Spirit also gave him strength and courage to resist temptation.

4. Prayerful Protection: Jesus also prayed for protection from Satan, asking God to strengthen him and keep him safe.

5. Jesus' ultimate sacrifice: Jesus' ultimate sacrifice was to give His life for us, to fulfill the will of God. This is the greatest act of love and obedience anyone could ever do.

These are some of the ways that Jesus used to resist the temptations presented by Satan.

Grade: 85%

Comment: The response provides a good overview of Jesus' strategies for resisting temptation, including prayer and scripture, love and obedience, Holy Spirit guidance, and prayerful protection. However, it does not explicitly mention Jesus' ultimate sacrifice as an example of resisting temptation.

The answer provided is also somewhat superficial in that it only mentions "scripture" and "unwavering faith," without elaborating on the specific ways in which Jesus used these tools to resist Satan's temptations. Nevertheless, the response shows a good understanding of the importance of prayer and scripture in one's walk with God.

In terms of how this response addresses the concern of combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ, it provides some useful insights into Jesus' approach to resisting temptation, which can be applied to one's own life. However, it could have been more explicitly connected to daily life and provided more practical advice on how to put these strategies into practice.

Overall, the response is good but not outstanding in its ability to address the concern of combating temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ.
