  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 90. The student provided a thorough explanation of the strategies Jesus used to resist temptations, including prayer, scripture, love, obedience, Holy Spirit guidance, prayerful protection, and Jesus' ultimate sacrifice. These strategies are all aligned with a Christian worldview and showcase a strong understanding of combating temptation as a follower of Christ. The only improvement could be to directly address the concern raised by applying these strategies to daily life situations, but the overall response demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic."
