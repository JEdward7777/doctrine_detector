Jesus used several strategies to resist the temptations presented by Satan. These include:

1. Prayer and Scripture: Jesus prayed and quoted scripture to help him stay focused on God's will. He also used the Bible as a guide for his actions, using it to help him make decisions that were in line with God's teachings.

2. Love and Obedience: Jesus' love for God was central to everything he did. He always put God's will above all else, even when it meant suffering and persecution.

3. Holy Spirit Guidance: Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit, which helped him to discern what was right and what was wrong. The Holy Spirit also gave him strength and courage to resist temptation.

4. Prayerful Protection: Jesus also prayed for protection from Satan, asking God to strengthen him and keep him safe.

5. Jesus' ultimate sacrifice: Jesus' ultimate sacrifice was to give His life for us, to fulfill the will of God. This is the greatest act of love and obedience anyone could ever do.

These are some of the ways that Jesus used to resist the temptations presented by Satan.

I would grade this response as a 90. The student provided a thorough explanation of the strategies Jesus used to resist temptations, including prayer, scripture, love, obedience, Holy Spirit guidance, prayerful protection, and Jesus' ultimate sacrifice. These strategies are all aligned with a Christian worldview and showcase a strong understanding of combating temptation as a follower of Christ. The only improvement could be to directly address the concern raised by applying these strategies to daily life situations, but the overall response demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic.
