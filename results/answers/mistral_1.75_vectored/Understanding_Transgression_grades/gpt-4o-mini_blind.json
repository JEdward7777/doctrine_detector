It correctly highlights the act of going beyond God's commands leading to disobedience and potential consequences. However, it could be improved by emphasizing the aspect of sinfulness inherent in transgression and the need for repentance and seeking forgiveness from God. Additionally, mentioning the role of Jesus Christ in providing redemption for our transgressions would enhance the completeness of the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
