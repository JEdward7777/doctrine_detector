  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a good explanation of how trespass is viewed as a sin in Christianity, emphasizing actions that go against God's commands and teachings. However, the student could improve the answer by more directly addressing the concern of clarifying the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God. Further elaboration on how trespassing against others is also seen as sin against God in Christian ethics would strengthen the response."
