  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the relationship between trespass and sin in a Christian worldview. It provides examples of trespass in both interpersonal and biblical contexts, and emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and love for those who trespass against us.
