  "grade_comment": "Grade: 87\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the concept of trespass in a Christian context, linking it to both violations of human relationships and God's moral laws. The explanation provided acknowledges the importance of understanding the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God in Christian ethics. The response could be strengthened by providing more specific examples or references to biblical teachings to further support the explanation. Overall, a solid understanding of the concept is demonstrated but could benefit from deeper engagement with scriptural references."
