The Bible teaches us that the Holy Spirit is sent to guide us and help us live a holy life. However, there are also certain characteristics that are considered "unholy" in the Bible. Here are some examples:

1. Loving God above all else: Jesus taught us to love God above all else, but if we love anything more than God, we are living an unholy life. This includes loving money, material possessions, or even people more than God.

2. Loving our neighbor as ourselves: Jesus also taught us to love our neighbor as ourselves. If we treat others with kindness and love, we are fulfilling this commandment. But if we treat others with hatred, violence, or any other form of love that is not based on Christ's love, we are living an unholy life.

3. Fruits of the Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit gives us fruits that are meant to help us live a holy life. These include love, joy, peace, forgiveness, and many others. If we are not producing these fruits in our lives, we may be living an unholy life.

4. Sinful acts: Certain acts are considered sinful in the Bible, such as murder, adultery, theft, and many others. If we commit these sins, we are living an unholy life.

5. Prayer and worship: We are called to pray and worship God regularly. If we neglect these important spiritual practices, we may be living an unholy life.

To identify these characteristics in our actions or society, we can look at the teachings of the Bible and ask ourselves if we are living according to those teachings. We can also ask ourselves if we are treating others with love and kindness, and if we are producing the fruits of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Additionally, we can seek guidance from the Holy Spirit and ask Him to help us live a holy life.
