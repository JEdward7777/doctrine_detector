  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a generally solid answer discussing characteristics of an unholy life based on biblical teachings. They correctly highlight the importance of loving God above all else, loving our neighbor as ourselves, producing the fruits of the Holy Spirit, avoiding sinful acts, and engaging in prayer and worship. The references to scripture and the Holy Spirit are appropriate. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples of how these characteristics manifest in actions or society, and perhaps delving deeper into the consequences of living an unholy life according to Christian beliefs."
