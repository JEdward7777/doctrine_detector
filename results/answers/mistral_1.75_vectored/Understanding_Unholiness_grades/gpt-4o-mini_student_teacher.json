  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer highlighting characteristics of an 'unholy' life based on biblical teachings. They emphasized the importance of loving God and others, producing fruits of the Holy Spirit, avoiding sinful acts, and engaging in prayer and worship. The response effectively connects these characteristics to living a holy life. However, the answer could have further emphasized the concept of rebellion against God and actions that dishonor Him as key elements of an unholy life, as per the reference answer provided by the teacher. Integrating this aspect more prominently would have strengthened the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
