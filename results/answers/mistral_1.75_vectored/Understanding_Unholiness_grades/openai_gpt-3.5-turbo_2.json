  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of what constitutes an \"unholy\" life according to Christian beliefs, linking it to rebellion against God, dishonoring actions, and practices that do not glorify Him. The examples given align well with biblical teachings and emphasize the importance of living a life in accordance with God's will. The mention of self-examination and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit further enhances the depth of the response. Overall, the submission effectively addresses the concern provided with a solid Christian worldview perspective."
