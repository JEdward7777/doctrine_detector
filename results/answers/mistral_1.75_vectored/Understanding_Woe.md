## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The term "woe" is used in the Bible to convey a warning or a message of judgment. It is often used to express sorrow, grief, or lament. In the context of biblical warnings and judgments, it is used to emphasize the seriousness of the situation and the consequences of disobedience. For example, Jesus said, "Woe unto you, ye who peruse me more than the Holy Scriptures; I will fulfill this commandment which I have given you on this day (Luke 22:46)." This verse shows that Jesus was speaking of a warning and a judgment that would be fulfilled. Similarly, the book of Revelation contains many messages of woe and judgment for those who follow the teachings of the Antichrist.
