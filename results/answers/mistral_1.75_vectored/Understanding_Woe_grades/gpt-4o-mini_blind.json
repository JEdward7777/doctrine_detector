However, there are some inaccuracies in the interpretation of the Luke 22:46 verse and the reference to \"perusing\" Jesus more than the Holy Scriptures seems out of place. The overall explanation could benefit from more clarity and coherence in connecting the concept of \"woe\" to biblical warnings and judgments."
