  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the meaning of \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments. They accurately explain that it conveys a warning or message of judgment and cite an example from Luke 22:46 to support their claim. Additionally, the student correctly notes that \"woe\" often expresses sorrow, grief, or lament. However, the response could be improved by providing more examples or elaborating on the connection between \"woe\" and the concept of suffering as punishment for sins from a Christian perspective."
