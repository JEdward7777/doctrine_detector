It appropriately connects the term to the consequences of disobedience and emphasizes the seriousness of the situation. The reference to Jesus' warning in Luke and the mention of the book of Revelation further support the understanding of biblical implications of sin and judgment. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the need for repentance and turning back to God in light of these warnings to align more closely with a Christian worldview."
