  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a clear explanation of the term \"worldly\" according to Christian teachings and highlighted the importance of prioritizing Jesus Christ and His teachings. However, the student did not address the specific concern of contrasting worldly values with godly principles as outlined in the reference answer, which focused more on the negative aspects of worldly behaviors such as selfishness and ungodliness. The student's answer could be improved by incorporating this contrast to align more closely with the Christian worldview of distinguishing between worldly values and godly principles."
