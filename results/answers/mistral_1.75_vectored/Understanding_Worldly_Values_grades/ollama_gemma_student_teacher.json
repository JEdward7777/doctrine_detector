It correctly identifies that the term refers to things related to the world and its inhabitants. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific values and behaviors that are considered worldly according to Christian teachings. Additionally, the connection to the need to prioritize Jesus Christ and His teachings is well expressed."
