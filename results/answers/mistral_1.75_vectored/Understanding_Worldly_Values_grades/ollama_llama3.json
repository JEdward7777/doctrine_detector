  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response provides some accurate information about what \"worldly\" means in Christian teachings, such as referring to values, actions, and desires that are not centered on Jesus Christ. It also mentions the importance of prioritizing godly principles and living a life that is centered on Christ. However, the response does not fully capture the concern of understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles.\n\nA more complete answer would have explicitly stated the contrast between worldly values (such as selfishness and corruption) and godly principles (such as humility and obedience to God). It would also have highlighted how Christians are called to live a life that is distinct from the world, while still engaging with it in a way that reflects Jesus' teachings.\n\nThe main area for improvement is providing a more explicit contrast between worldly values and godly principles."
