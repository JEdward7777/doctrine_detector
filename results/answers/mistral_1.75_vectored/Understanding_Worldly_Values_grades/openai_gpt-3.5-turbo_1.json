  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response does a good job of explaining the concept of \"worldly\" in Christian teachings and the importance of prioritizing godly principles over worldly values. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the contrast between worldly values (selfishness, corruption, ungodliness) and godly principles (love, service, humility, obedience to God). The only improvement could be to provide biblical references to support the points made. Overall, a solid response from a Christian worldview perspective."
