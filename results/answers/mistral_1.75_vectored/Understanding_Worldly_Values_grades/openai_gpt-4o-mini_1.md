## [Answer](../Understanding_Worldly_Values.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The term "worldly" in Christian teachings refers to anything that is related to the world or the people of the world, including their values, actions, and desires. It is considered a sin to love the world more than Jesus Christ, as Jesus said in John 3:16. This means that Christians are called to live a life that is centered on Jesus Christ and His teachings, and to prioritize the values and actions that are consistent with those teachings. This includes loving one's neighbor, serving others, and living a life of humility and obedience to God.
