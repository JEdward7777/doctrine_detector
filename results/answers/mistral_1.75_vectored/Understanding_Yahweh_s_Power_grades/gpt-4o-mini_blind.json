  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The answer is incorrect and shows a misunderstanding of the question. The statement \"I am Yahweh\" is a declaration made by God in the Old Testament, specifically in the book of Exodus. It emphasizes God's self-existence, sovereignty, and power. The answer confuses Jesus with Yahweh and misinterprets the significance of the statement. More focus on the attributes of Yahweh in the Old Testament context is necessary for a higher grade."
