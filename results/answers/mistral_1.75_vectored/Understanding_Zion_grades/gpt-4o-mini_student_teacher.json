  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a decent understanding of the spiritual significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel, as well as its symbolic representation of the Church. However, the answer lacks a deep exploration of the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people, as requested in the concern. Additionally, there is a slight deviation from the reference answer provided by the teacher in terms of emphasis and depth of analysis."
