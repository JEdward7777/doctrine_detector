  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the spiritual significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" as it relates to the people of Israel and the Church. The explanation effectively connects the metaphorical language used in Scripture with God's relationship with His people, highlighting themes of affection, care, holiness, obedience, and mission. However, a more direct connection to God's affection and care for His people could have been emphasized to align more closely with the given biblical reference and concern."
