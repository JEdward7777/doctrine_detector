## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The concepts of Sheol and Hades are both found in the Bible and are used to describe the Christian hope for salvation. However, there are some differences between these two concepts that can be important to understand.

Sheol is a biblical concept that refers to the place where the righteous and the unrighteous go after death. It is described as a place of protection and blessing for those who have been saved through Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, Jesus speaks about the importance of being born again and entering into Sheol, which is also referred to as the Holy Spirit.

Hades, on the other hand, is also a biblical concept that refers to the place where all people go after death. It is described as a place of judgment and punishment for those who have sinned. In the New Testament, Jesus speaks about the importance of being forgiven and entering into eternal life, which is also referred to as the Holy Spirit.

In the Bible, the ultimate goal is to enter into eternal life, which is a gift from God. This is a promise that is available to everyone who believes in Jesus Christ. The Bible teaches that we should strive to live a holy life and follow Jesus Christ, so that we can receive this gift of eternal life.

In summary, while Sheol and Hades are both biblical concepts that refer to the afterlife, they have different meanings and purposes. Sheol is a place of protection and blessing for those who have been saved through Jesus Christ, while Hades is a place of judgment and punishment for those who have sinned. The ultimate goal is to enter into eternal life, which is a gift from God that is available to everyone who believes in Jesus Christ.
