  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concepts of Sheol and Hades, and their relation to the afterlife of the righteous and the unrighteous. The student accurately explains the initial neutral understanding of both concepts, and their eventual association with righteousness and unrighteousness in the New Testament. However, the student's answer could benefit from further elaboration on the symbolic and theological interpretations of these concepts in Christian tradition."
