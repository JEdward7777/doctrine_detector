It effectively addresses the concern regarding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death by emphasizing the association of Hades with the unrighteous in the New Testament. However, the response could have delved deeper into the Christian perspective on salvation and judgment for a more comprehensive analysis."
