  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Jesus Christ as the cornerstone in the context of the Assembly of believers, touching on various aspects such as foundation, unity, love, peace, and servant leadership. However, the student could strengthen their answer by focusing more on how Jesus Christ's role as the cornerstone impacts the faith and community involvement of believers, as highlighted in the concern. The reference answer from the teacher succinctly emphasizes the foundational support aspect, which the student should have integrated more explicitly into their response."
