  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively conveys the significance of Jesus' death on the cross as seen from a Christian perspective, highlighting its purpose as a sacrifice for humanity's sins and offering redemption and eternal life to those who believe in Him. While it may not be identical to the model answer, the response captures the essence of the concern by emphasizing the core concept of salvation through Jesus' sacrifice. The similarity in wording and ideas between the two responses supports this high grade."
