## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
In the Bible, being part of the "elect" or "chosen ones" refers to those who have been chosen by God to be part of His Church and to fulfill a special purpose in His plan. This includes Christians who are called to be followers of Jesus Christ and to serve Him in various ways. The Bible teaches that God has a special love for His chosen ones and that He wants to bless them and use them to bless others. It is also important to remember that being part of the "elect" is not something that can be earned or deserved, but rather it is a gift from God.
