The House of God can also refer to the physical temple or sanctuary where God's presence dwells in the Old Testament, such as the tabernacle built by Moses or the temple in Jerusalem. Additionally, it is important to note that the Church is not just a physical building but a spiritual body of believers united in Christ. The answer could have been improved by including these points for a more comprehensive explanation."
