  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the term \"House of God\" in a Christian context, but it lacks accuracy and depth. The answer focuses more on the broader concept of the Church as the House of God rather than the specific historical and biblical significance of the term in relation to the tabernacle or temple. The response could be improved by integrating biblical references and providing a more focused explanation on the original meaning and symbolism of the 'house of God' in Scripture."
