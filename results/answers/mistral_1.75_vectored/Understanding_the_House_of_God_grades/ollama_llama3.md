Comment: The response provides some general information about what the "House of God" refers to, but it does not fully address the concern of clarifying its significance and meaning in Scripture. While it mentions that the term is used to refer to a Christian church or congregation, as well as the body of believers who are called to be part of the Holy Church, it does not delve deeper into the biblical context and significance of this phrase.

The response also lacks specific biblical references and explanations, which would help to further clarify its meaning. Additionally, while it mentions that the "House of God" is referred to as the Church of Jesus Christ, the body of believers who are called to be part of the Holy Church, and a place where Christians come together to worship and serve God, this information is not directly related to the concern of clarifying its significance and meaning in Scripture.

Overall, while the response provides some general information about what the "House of God" refers to, it does not fully address the concern and could be improved by providing more specific biblical references and explanations.
