  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided some accurate information about the significance and meaning of the term \"House of God\" in Scripture by mentioning the tabernacle or temple where God is worshiped. However, the student response went beyond the specific concern by discussing the House of God in the context of the Christian church and the Church of Jesus Christ. While the additional information is relevant to a Christian worldview, it deviates somewhat from the focus on the term as it relates to the physical dwelling place of God in the Old Testament."
