5. Prayer: Jesus prayed for His followers and teaches us to pray for others (Matthew 6:9-10).

6. Servant leadership: Jesus came to serve and not to be served, and we are called to serve others in the same way (Matthew 22:39).

These are just some of the characteristics that reflect the image of God in us.
