  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student provides a solid response outlining key characteristics reflecting the image of God according to a biblical perspective. The references to specific Bible verses strengthen the answer. However, it would have been beneficial to include a more direct connection to the creation of humanity in the image of God as stated in Genesis 1:27. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of righteousness, holiness, and wisdom in reflecting God's image would enhance the completeness of the answer. Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
