However, the response could be improved by incorporating the broader understanding of human characteristics such as emotions, reason, communication, and eternal spirit that reflect the image of God as stated in the reference answer. Integrating both perspectives would provide a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to be created in the image of God according to the biblical definition."
