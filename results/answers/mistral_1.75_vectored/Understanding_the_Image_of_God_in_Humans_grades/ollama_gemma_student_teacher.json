  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical definition of the image of God. They effectively identify several characteristics of Jesus that Christians are called to embody. The inclusion of relevant scripture references adds depth and authenticity to the response. \n\nHowever, the response would benefit from a broader exploration of the characteristics of human beings in general, beyond those specifically referencing Jesus. The reference answer provided highlights qualities like the ability to feel emotion and reason, which are relevant aspects of being created in the image of God. Including such elements would enhance the comprehensiveness of the student's answer."
