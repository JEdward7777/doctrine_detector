According to the Bible, Jesus Christ is the image of God. Therefore, Christians are called to be like Jesus and reflect the image of God in their lives. Some of the characteristics that reflect this image include:

1. Love: Jesus loves his followers deeply and commands us to love one another as He loves us (John 3:16).

2. Kindness: Jesus was kind and compassionate, and we are called to be kind to others (Matthew 7:14).

3. Humility: Jesus humbled himself and became obedient to God, even unto death. We are called to humble ourselves and serve others (Philippians 2:1-4).

4. Forgiveness: Jesus forgives those who have sinned and calls us to forgive others (Ephesians 4:7-8).

5. Prayer: Jesus prayed for His followers and teaches us to pray for others (Matthew 6:9-10).

6. Servant leadership: Jesus came to serve and not to be served, and we are called to serve others in the same way (Matthew 22:39).

7. Holy Spirit guidance: Jesus promised to send the Holy Spirit to guide and empower us to live a holy life (Acts 1:7).

These are just some of the characteristics that reflect the image of God in us.
