It appropriately addresses the concern of understanding God\u2019s sovereignty and authority in our lives by emphasizing the reign of God in both the hearts of believers and in the physical world. The response could be enhanced by including specific biblical references that illustrate God's sovereignty and authority, further strengthening the Christian worldview perspective."
