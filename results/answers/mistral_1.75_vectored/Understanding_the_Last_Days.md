## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The "last days" in the Bible refer to a period of time that culminated with the coming of Jesus Christ. This period was also known as the "Holy Spirit's promise" and was meant to be a time of preparation for the coming of Jesus.

In the New Testament, Jesus spoke about the last days and taught his followers how to prepare for them. He said that the Holy Spirit would come upon them and guide them in their mission to spread the Gospel. He also warned of persecution and trials that would come upon his followers during this time.

The last days were also associated with the coming of Jesus himself. Jesus promised to return to earth to fulfill his mission to save the world. He said that he would come again to fulfill the scriptures and to establish his kingdom on earth.

The exact timing of the last days is not specified in the Bible, but it is believed that they began with the ministry of Jesus and will continue until the end of time. The last days are also seen as a time of great blessing and joy, as Jesus will come to fulfill his promises and bring peace and salvation to all who follow him.
