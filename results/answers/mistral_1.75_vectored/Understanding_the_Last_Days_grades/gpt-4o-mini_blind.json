They correctly highlight the connection between the last days and the preparation for Jesus' arrival, as well as the warning of persecution and trials for followers. The mention of the Holy Spirit's role is also commendable. However, the student could improve by incorporating more scriptural references and delving into the doctrinal significance of the last days in Christian eschatology. Additionally, a clearer distinction between the first and second comings of Jesus would enhance the response."
