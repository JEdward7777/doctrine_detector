  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 75.\n\nThe student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of the \"last days\" and the role they play in relation to Jesus' first and second comings. They correctly mention the association of the last days with the coming of Jesus and the promise of His return. However, the student's answer could be improved by explicitly stating that the 'last days' refer to the time beginning with Jesus' first coming and ending with His second coming and the final day of judgment, as mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher.\n\nOverall, the student provides a sound explanation, but a clearer link to the specific timeframe as defined in the reference answer would strengthen their response."
