  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer contains some correct elements, such as mentioning the significance of Yahweh as a central name in the Bible and its use for prayers. However, the student's answer incorrectly equates Yahweh with the name of Jesus in the Christian context. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes Yahweh as God's personal name signifying His eternal and self-existent nature, which the student fails to address accurately. The student's response could benefit from a deeper understanding of the unique significance of Yahweh in the Old Testament."
