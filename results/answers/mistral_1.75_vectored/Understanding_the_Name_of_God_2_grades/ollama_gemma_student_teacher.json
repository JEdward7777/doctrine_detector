  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer adequately explains the significance of the name Yahweh in the context of the Old Testament. However, it lacks nuance and fails to capture the deeper theological significance of the name as God's eternal and self-existent nature. The answer also conflates the use of Yahweh in the Old Testament with its application in Christianity, which may be confusing to students unfamiliar with both traditions."
