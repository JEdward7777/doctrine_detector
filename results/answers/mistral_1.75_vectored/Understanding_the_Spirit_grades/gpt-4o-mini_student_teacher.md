Grade: 40

Comment: The student's response has some elements of truth regarding the roles of the Holy Spirit and evil spirits in the Christian faith. However, there is a lack of clarity in distinguishing between the human spirit and evil spirits as requested in the question. The student needs to focus more on addressing the specific concern raised and providing a clear biblical distinction between personal spiritual identity and malevolent spiritual influences according to a Christian worldview.
