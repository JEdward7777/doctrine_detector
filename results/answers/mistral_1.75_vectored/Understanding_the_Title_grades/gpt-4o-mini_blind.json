The connection to the Old Testament roots and Jesus' role as a servant and Messiah is accurately highlighted. However, the response could be improved by delving deeper into the specific doctrinal implications of Jesus as the \"Son of Man\" from a Christian worldview, such as His dual nature as fully God and fully man and His role in redemption and judgment. Additionally, incorporating more Scriptural references to support the points made would strengthen the answer."
