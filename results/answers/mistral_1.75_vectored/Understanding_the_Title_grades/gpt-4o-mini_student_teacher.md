Comment: The student provided a good overview of the significance of the title "Son of Man" in relation to Jesus' identity and mission. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine, which is a key aspect of the title 'Son of Man' in Christian theology. Emphasizing this aspect would provide a deeper understanding of the implications of Jesus' self-identification for our faith.
