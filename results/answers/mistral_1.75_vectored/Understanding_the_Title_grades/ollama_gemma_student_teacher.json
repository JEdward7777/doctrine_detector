The student correctly points out its Old Testament roots and its connection to Jesus' role as a servant and Messiah. Additionally, the student provides a spiritual interpretation of the title, highlighting its connection to Jesus' teachings and the importance of serving others. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit explanation of the dual nature of Jesus and how the title \"Son of Man\" reflects this concept."
