While the response mentions that the title is associated with Jesus' mission and ministry, it does not delve deeper into how this title relates to our own calling as Christians or how we can apply Jesus' teachings about serving and loving others.\n\nThe given answer provides a more specific and detailed understanding of the significance of the title \"Son of Man\", emphasizing Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine. This is an important insight that could have been explored further in the response to provide a richer understanding of the implications for our faith.\n\nTo improve, the response could have provided more concrete examples or biblical passages that illustrate how the title \"Son of Man\" relates to our own spiritual growth and discipleship as Christians."
