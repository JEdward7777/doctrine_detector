It addresses the concern by exploring how this title impacts our faith by highlighting Jesus' servant role, love, and the importance of serving others. However, it could have been strengthened by incorporating more direct references to relevant biblical passages or theological doctrines that specifically demonstrate the implications of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' for our faith."
