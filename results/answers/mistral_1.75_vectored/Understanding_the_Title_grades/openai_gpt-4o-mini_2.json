  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good understanding of the significance of Jesus' title as the \"Son of Man\" and its implications for our faith. It correctly highlights Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity. The response also effectively discusses how this title is rooted in the Old Testament and relates to Jesus' mission and teachings on serving and loving others. However, to enhance the grade, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" could have been included."
