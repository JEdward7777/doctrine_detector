  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a basic understanding of the Trinity but made some significant errors in their explanation. They incorrectly equated the Holy Bible as one of the divine persons of the Trinity, which is not a correct teaching in Christian theology. Additionally, the student's explanation lacked depth and clarity, failing to address the distinctiveness of each person of the Trinity while being fully God. The response also lacked scriptural references to support their points. Overall, the answer does not effectively address the complexities of the Trinity and God's nature, earning a lower grade."
