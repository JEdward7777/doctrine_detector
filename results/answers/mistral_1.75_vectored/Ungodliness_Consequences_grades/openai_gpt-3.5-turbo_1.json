The mention of repentance and turning to Jesus Christ for salvation is appropriate. However, the response could further emphasize the eternal consequences of living in disobedience to God in a more impactful manner, focusing on the separation from God and spiritual death. Integrating more Scriptural references and expounding on the seriousness of the consequences of disobedience would strengthen the Christian worldview perspective in addressing the concern."
