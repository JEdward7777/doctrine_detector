## [Answer](../Ungodliness_Consequences.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that God loves all people and wants everyone to be saved. However, it also teaches that God has a plan to redeem those who have sinned and repent of their sin. If someone is not willing to repent and turn to Jesus Christ as their Savior, they will be judged according to the Bible's teachings.

The Bible teaches that God will judge all people according to the love that we have for one another (1 Corinthians 2:16). This means that those who love and serve others will be blessed, while those who love and serve themselves will be judged.

In addition to this, the Bible teaches that God will judge all people according to the Ten Commandments (Matthew 7:12). These commandments include loving God above all else, loving your neighbor as yourself, and honoring the Lord's name. Those who have broken these commands will be judged according to the severity of their sin.

If you are seeking forgiveness and salvation through Jesus Christ, I encourage you to pray and ask Jesus to come into your heart and guide you in your life. He will help you to love and serve others, and will guide you to live a life that is pleasing to God.
