  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: \nThe student has correctly identified that the term \"Holy One\" is used in both the Old and New Testaments to refer to individuals who are considered holy and righteous. However, it is important to note that in the Old Testament, the term \"Holy One\" primarily refers to God Himself rather than Jesus Christ. Additionally, while Jesus is indeed referred to as the Holy One in the New Testament, the student could have provided more specific references from both the Old and New Testaments to strengthen their answer. Overall, the response demonstrates a basic understanding but lacks some depth and specificity."
