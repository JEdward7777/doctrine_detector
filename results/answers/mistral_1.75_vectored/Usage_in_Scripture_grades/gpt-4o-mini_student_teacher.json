  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer is partially accurate in recognizing the term \"Holy One\" being used in both the Old and New Testaments. However, the student's answer lacks specificity in distinguishing the subtle difference in usage between the two. The student correctly identifies Jesus as the Holy One in the New Testament, but could have provided more detail on the significance of this title in relation to Jesus' authority and divinity."
