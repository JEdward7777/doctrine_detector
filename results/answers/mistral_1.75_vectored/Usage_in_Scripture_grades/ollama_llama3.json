  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testament, and providing some context about its usage. However, it does not fully explore the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which is the primary concern. The response also does not provide any specific examples or scriptural references to support its claims.\n\nThe response does show some understanding of the term \"Holy One\" and its usage across different Testaments, but it lacks depth and clarity in its exploration of Jesus' authority and divinity."
