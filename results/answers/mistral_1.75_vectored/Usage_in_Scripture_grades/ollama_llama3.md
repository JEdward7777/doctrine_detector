## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The term "Holy One" is used several times in both the Old and New Testament. In the Old Testament, it is used to refer to Jesus Christ, as well as to other individuals who are considered holy and righteous. In the New Testament, it is used specifically to refer to Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the Holy One throughout the Gospel accounts.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 60.

The response partially addresses the concern by mentioning the term "Holy One" in both the Old and New Testament, and providing some context about its usage. However, it does not fully explore the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, which is the primary concern. The response also does not provide any specific examples or scriptural references to support its claims.

The response does show some understanding of the term "Holy One" and its usage across different Testaments, but it lacks depth and clarity in its exploration of Jesus' authority and divinity.
