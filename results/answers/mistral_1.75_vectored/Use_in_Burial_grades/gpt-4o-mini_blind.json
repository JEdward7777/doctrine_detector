  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a general overview of the significance of myrrh in biblical times, but there are some doctrinal inaccuracies in the response. For example, there are incorrect references cited (such as John 3:46 which does not exist) and some confusion in the explanation of the uses of myrrh. The student should strive for more accuracy and clarity in their understanding and presentation of biblical concepts."
