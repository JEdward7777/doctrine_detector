  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant information about myrrh in the Bible, but the answer focused more on the symbolic and religious significance of myrrh rather than its specific usage in burial practices. The student did not directly address how myrrh was used in preparing dead bodies for burial, which was a key aspect of the question. The answer could be improved by tying the examples provided back to the actual burial practices in biblical times."
