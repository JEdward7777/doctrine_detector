  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a good understanding of myrrh's role in biblical burial practices, citing examples from Scripture that support its use as an offering to Jesus, in burial rituals, and for prayer and worship. The mention of myrrh's healing properties and protective symbolism also adds depth to the discussion.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by more directly addressing the concern about recognizing customs surrounding burial practices. While the response does touch on this topic, it could benefit from a more explicit exploration of how these customs enhance comprehension of cultural contexts in Scripture.\n\nOverall, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding myrrh's significance in biblical times and its connections to Jesus' life and ministry."
