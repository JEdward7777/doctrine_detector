Myrrh was a precious aromatic resin that was highly valued in the Bible. It was used in various ways in the context of burial practices in biblical times. Here are some examples:

1. Offering to Jesus: The Bible tells us that Jesus was anointed with myrrh before His crucifision (Matthew 26:7). This was done as a symbol of love and protection, and it also fulfilled prophecy (Psalm 22:3).

2. Buried with Jesus: According to the Gospel of John, Jesus was buried with myrrum (John 3:46). This shows how important myrrh was in the Christian tradition.

3. Used for prayer and worship: Myrrh was also used in prayer and worship. For example, the Bible says that Mary Magdalene came to Jesus and anointed him with myrrum (Luke 7:39-46). This was a sign of love and devotion.

4. Used for healing: Myrrh was also used for its healing properties. The Bible mentions that Jesus used myrrh to heal the sick (Matthew 26:7).

5. Used for protection: Myrrh was also used as a protective symbol. For example, the Bible says that Jesus was anointed with myrrum before He went to the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:46). This shows that myrrum was seen as a symbol of protection and love.

Overall, myrrh was highly valued in the Bible and was used in many different ways in the context of burial practices.
