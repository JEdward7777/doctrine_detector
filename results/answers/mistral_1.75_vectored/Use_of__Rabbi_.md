John the Baptist was referred to as "Rabbi" in the New Testament. He was a Christian leader who was known for his teachings and baptisms, and he is considered to be a prophet of Jesus Christ. In the Bible, John is referred to as "Rabbi Jesus" (Matthew 26:39), which shows that he was recognized as a Rabbi by those who knew him.

Jesus also referred to himself as "Rabbi" in the New Testament. He was a Jewish Messiah who taught and preached about love, forgiveness, and salvation. He was also known for his teachings on the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes. In the Bible, Jesus is referred to as "Rabbi Jesus" (Matthew 7:10) and "Rabbi Jesus Christ our Savior" (Ephesians 4:7).

In addition to being referred to as "Rabbi," Jesus is also referred to as "Savior" and "Lord." These titles reflect his role as a Christian leader and his ultimate mission to save people from sin and bring them closer to God.
