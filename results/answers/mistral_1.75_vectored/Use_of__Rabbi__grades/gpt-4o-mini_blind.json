While John the Baptist was a significant figure in the New Testament, there is no record of him being referred to as \"Rabbi\" in the Bible. Jesus, on the other hand, was indeed called \"Rabbi\" by his disciples and others (e.g., Matthew 26:25). The statement about John being called \"Rabbi Jesus\" is incorrect; the term \"Rabbi Jesus\" does not appear in the referenced verse (Matthew 26:39). Additionally, the usage of \"Rabbi Jesus Christ our Savior\" in Ephesians 4:7 is inaccurate.\n\nThe response also lacks clarity in distinguishing between John the Baptist and Jesus in their respective roles and titles. While Jesus is indeed referred to as \"Savior\" and \"Lord\" in the New Testament, the explanation could be more explicitly tied to the concept of Jesus being the Son of God and the fulfillment of prophecies as the Messiah. \n\nOverall, the answer needs more precision and accuracy in presenting biblical references and theological concepts related to the titles and roles of John the Baptist and Jesus."
