  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided some accurate information about John the Baptist and Jesus being referred to as \"Rabbi\" in the New Testament. However, the student's answer contained some inaccuracies such as stating that John the Baptist was a Christian leader and Jesus referring to himself as \"Rabbi Jesus Christ our Savior,\" which does not align with biblical accounts. The answer lacks depth in explaining the significance of the title \"Rabbi\" in relation to respect and authority in teaching. Further elaboration on the disciples' use of the term would have strengthened the answer."
