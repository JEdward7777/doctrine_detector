  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of \"Rabbi\" in relation to both John the Baptist and Jesus. They provide relevant biblical references to support their claims and clearly explain the significance of the title in both individuals' roles as teachers and spiritual leaders. However, the answer could be improved by acknowledging that the title \"Rabbi\" was not exclusive to Christian leaders and was also used in other contexts."
