  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response accurately highlights the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings by mentioning their titles as \"Rabbi.\" However, there is some ambiguity in attributing the term \"Christian leader\" to John the Baptist, as Christianity as a distinct religion had not yet fully emerged during his time. Clarifying this point and expanding on the unique aspects of Jesus' teachings within a Christian worldview would strengthen the response."
