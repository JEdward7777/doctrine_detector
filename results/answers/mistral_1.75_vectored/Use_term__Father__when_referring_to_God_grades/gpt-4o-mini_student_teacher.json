  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid answer rooted in Biblical teachings and the importance of following Jesus' example. They correctly emphasize the significance of using the term \"Father\" in reference to God to maintain theological accuracy and uphold the scriptural message. However, the answer could be enhanced by elaborating on the importance of relying on teaching and context to clarify any potential misunderstandings that may arise from using the term \"Father.\" Overall, a comprehensive and well-supported response."
