Yes, it is important to use the term "Father" when referring to God in contexts where it could be misunderstood. The Bible teaches us that Jesus referred to Jesus Christ as our Father and we are called to follow His example.

Therefore, using the term "Father" in this context is appropriate and should not be misunderstood.
