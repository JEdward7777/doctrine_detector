  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response generally aligns with the specified answer and addresses the concern about theological inaccuracies. It correctly emphasizes the importance of using the term \"Father\" when referring to God, citing Jesus' example in the Bible. The response also acknowledges the need for teaching and context to clarify any misunderstandings that may arise.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response could be more concise and direct in its argumentation. For instance, while it mentions that using \"Father\" is based on biblical teachings, it could have provided specific scriptural references to support this point. Additionally, some of the sentences are a bit long-winded and could be rephrased for greater clarity.\n\nOverall, I believe the response provides a good foundation for addressing the concern about theological inaccuracies and diluting the scriptural message, but could benefit from some refinement in terms of structure and supporting evidence."
