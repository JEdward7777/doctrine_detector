Yes, it is important to use the term "Father" when referring to God in contexts where it could be misunderstood. The Bible teaches us that Jesus referred to Jesus Christ as our Father and we are called to follow His example. It is also important to remember that the Holy Bible is a Christian book and its teachings are based on the love of God and the love of Jesus Christ. Therefore, using the term "Father" in this context is appropriate and should not be misunderstood.
