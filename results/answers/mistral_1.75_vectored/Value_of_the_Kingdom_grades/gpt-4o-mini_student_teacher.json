  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided several parables that relate to serving the Lord and being prepared for His coming, the focus of the concern on appreciating the worth and significance of the kingdom of God was not fully addressed. The reference answer emphasizes the transformative power and immense value of the kingdom of God, which the student did not capture in their response. They could have earned a higher grade by including parables such as the mustard seed, yeast, hidden treasure, and perfect pearl that directly illustrate the immense value of the kingdom of God."
