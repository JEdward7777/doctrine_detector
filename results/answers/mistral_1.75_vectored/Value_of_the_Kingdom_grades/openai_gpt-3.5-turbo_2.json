It effectively demonstrates how Jesus used parables to convey the value and transformative power of the Kingdom. The incorporation of additional parables enhances the understanding of the importance of being faithful, prepared, loving, and serving others in the context of the Kingdom of God. This response effectively addresses the concern of appreciating the worth and significance of the kingdom of God in our lives from a Christian worldview."
