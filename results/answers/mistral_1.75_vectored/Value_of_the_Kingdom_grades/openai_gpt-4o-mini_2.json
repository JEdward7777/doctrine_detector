  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provided a solid understanding of Jesus comparing the kingdom of God to a mustard seed, yeast, hidden treasure, and a perfect pearl, highlighting its immense value and transformative power. However, the student's original response missed focusing on these specific comparisons and instead elaborated on other parables. While those parables are valuable teachings from Jesus, they do not directly address the concern of appreciating the worth and significance of the kingdom of God as effectively as the mentioned comparisons."
