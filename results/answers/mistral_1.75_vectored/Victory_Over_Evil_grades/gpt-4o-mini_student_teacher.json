  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer about the promise of Jesus ultimately defeating Satan as described in the book of Revelation. The student effectively connected the promise to Jesus' victory over evil and the hope and assurance it offers to Christians. However, the answer did not directly reference the specific promise regarding Eve's descendant (the Messiah) defeating Satan completely and crushing his power forever as stated in the reference answer. This connection to the specific promise could have strengthened the response."
