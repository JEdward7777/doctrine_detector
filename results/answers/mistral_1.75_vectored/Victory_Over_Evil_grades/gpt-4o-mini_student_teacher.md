## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible promises that Jesus will ultimately defeat Satan and his evil. This is fulfilled in the book of Revelation, where Jesus is described as a Lamb who was holy and innocent, but also very meek and humble. He is promised to be victorious over Satan and his followers, and to bring peace and salvation to all who follow Him.

In Revelation 3:20, Jesus says, "I am always with you, and I will always protect you and fill you with love and joy."

In Revelation 12:7-14, we see Jesus triumphing over Satan and his followers, and Jesus promises to help us overcome any trials and temptations that come our way.

In Revelation 21:7, Jesus promises to make things new again, and to make all things right.

In Revelation 22:1-5, Jesus promises to be with us forever, and to bless us with eternal life.

These promises are a reminder that Jesus is always with us, and that He will always protect and guide us. We can have peace and joy in the midst of trials and tribulations, knowing that Jesus has already won the victory over Satan and His followers.

Grade: 75

Comment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer about the promise of Jesus ultimately defeating Satan as described in the book of Revelation. The student effectively connected the promise to Jesus' victory over evil and the hope and assurance it offers to Christians. However, the answer did not directly reference the specific promise regarding Eve's descendant (the Messiah) defeating Satan completely and crushing his power forever as stated in the reference answer. This connection to the specific promise could have strengthened the response.
