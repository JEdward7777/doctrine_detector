  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately identifies several biblical passages that support the promise of Jesus' ultimate defeat of Satan. The response also correctly notes that this promise offers hope and assurance to Christians regarding God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph over evil. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the specific concern mentioned in the prompt, which refers to God's promise to Eve's descendant defeating Satan. Including this additional element would strengthen the student's response and align it more closely with the reference answer."
