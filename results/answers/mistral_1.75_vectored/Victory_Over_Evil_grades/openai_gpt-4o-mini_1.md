## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible promises that Jesus will ultimately defeat Satan and his evil. This is fulfilled in the book of Revelation, where Jesus is described as a Lamb who was holy and innocent, but also very meek and humble. He is promised to be victorious over Satan and his followers, and to bring peace and salvation to all who follow Him.

In Revelation 3:20, Jesus says, "I am always with you, and I will always protect you and fill you with love and joy."

In Revelation 12:7-14, we see Jesus triumphing over Satan and his followers, and Jesus promises to help us overcome any trials and temptations that come our way.

In Revelation 21:7, Jesus promises to make things new again, and to make all things right.

In Revelation 22:1-5, Jesus promises to be with us forever, and to bless us with eternal life.

These promises are a reminder that Jesus is always with us, and that He will always protect and guide us. We can have peace and joy in the midst of trials and tribulations, knowing that Jesus has already won the victory over Satan and His followers.
