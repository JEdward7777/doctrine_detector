  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of practical ways Christians can honor God in their daily lives, touching on important aspects such as prayer, reading the Bible, love and service to others, evangelism, obedience to God's commands, generosity, kindness, and worship. While the student's response covers a wide range of actionable expressions of faith, it could be improved by focusing more on the central idea of thanking and praising God, obeying His commandments, and living in a manner that showcases His greatness as emphasized in the reference answer."
