However, there are doctrinal inaccuracies in the interpretation provided, such as equating Jesus with the Holy Spirit in the passage from John and some confusion in the explanation. It would be beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the distinct roles of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Scriptures as components of the Word of God for a more accurate theological understanding."
