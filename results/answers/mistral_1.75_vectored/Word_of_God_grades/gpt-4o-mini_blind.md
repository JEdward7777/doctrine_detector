The term "Word of God" in the Bible refers to Jesus Christ, who is considered the ultimate fulfillment and embodiment of the Word of God. He is referred to as the Word of God in the Gospel of John, where it says: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ was with the Holy Spirit, and Jesus Christ was with me. And I am praying that you will come into love and have fellowship with me and that I will come to you to give you a commandment to love one another. (John 3:16-17).

The Word of God also refers to the Holy Scriptures, which are considered the Bible. The Bible is considered the Word of God because it contains the teachings and commands of God, as well as the promises and blessings of God.
