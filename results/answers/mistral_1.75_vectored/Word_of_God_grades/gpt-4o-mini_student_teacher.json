However, there is a slight misinterpretation in associating the Word of God with Jesus praying in John 3:16-17, as those verses actually refer to God's love for the world. Additionally, the explanation could benefit from emphasizing the breadth of God's communication beyond Jesus and the Scriptures, such as through creation and personal revelation. Overall, a solid effort but with room for improvement in addressing the concern more fully."
