  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response accurately identifies various modern examples of idols that Christians may worship instead of the one true God. The inclusion of biblical reference to emphasize the importance of prioritizing God is commendable. However, further elaboration or explanation on why these examples can become idols and the negative spiritual implications would strengthen the response. Additionally, connecting each example to relevant biblical teachings or principles would enhance the depth of the answer."
