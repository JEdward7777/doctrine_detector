  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God, showing a good understanding of the concept. The student also tied their response back to the importance of putting God first in our lives and loving others, aligning well with the Christian worldview. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the specified concern of prioritizing devotion to God above all else, as outlined in the reference answer."
