  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of modern idols that Christians might worship instead of God, aligning well with the provided answer. It emphasizes the importance of putting God first in our lives and loving others, which is in line with the concern provided. The only minor improvement could be to include a direct relationship between the examples and the Biblical command to refrain from idol worship, but overall, this response demonstrates a solid understanding and application of Christian worldview principles."
