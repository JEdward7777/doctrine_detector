## Question [Worship Practices](../../../questions/Worship_Practices.md)
What are some modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God?

## Correct Answer
Modern idols can include material possessions, wealth, careers, or personal ambitions that take precedence over a relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
It's important for Christians to examine their lives and ensure that they are not prioritizing anything above their devotion to God.

## [Answer](../Worship_Practices.md) by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
Some modern examples of idols that Christians might worship instead of the one true God include:

1. Money and material possessions
2. Fashion and beauty
3. Social media and technology
4. Music and entertainment
5. Food and drink
6. Physical health and fitness
7. Family and friends
8. Personal goals and aspirations
9. Political leaders and political ideals
10. Love and relationships

These are just a few examples, but there are many other things that can become idols in our lives. It's important to remember that Jesus said "Love the Lord your Father above all else, and love your neighbor as yourself" (Matthew 22:39). This means that we should always put God first in our lives and love and serve others as well.
