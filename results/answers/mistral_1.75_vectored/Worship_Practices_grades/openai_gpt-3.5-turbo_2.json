  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of modern idols that Christians might worship instead of God and aligns well with the concern provided. The inclusion of examples like money, material possessions, and personal goals demonstrates a good understanding of how these things can become idols in our lives. Additionally, the reference to putting God first and loving others as ourselves from Matthew 22:39 reinforces the Christian worldview perspective. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern with a clear Christian perspective."
