## Answer given by [mistral 1.75 vectored](../../answering_models/mistral_1.75_vectored.md)
The Bible teaches that people are created to worship God and love Him above all else. This is stated in the Holy Scriptures, including the Old Testament and the New Testament. For example, in the Ten Commandments, it says: "You shall love the Lord your Savior Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, whom we love and serve. (Luke 22:16).

The Bible also warns against worshiping false gods. In the Old Testament, it says: "I am the Lord, you shall love me, my commandments, I will give you. I am the Lord. (Deuteronomy 7:14).

In the New Testament, Jesus teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves, and to love God above all else. He also warns us to be careful not to worship false idols. For example, in Matthew 22:39-40, Jesus says: "Love the Lord your Father, and whoever loves him will be with him. And whoever loves me will be with me. (Matthew 22:39-40).

It is important to remember that true worship and love should always be directed towards God, and not towards any other person or object. We are called to follow Jesus Christ and to love Him above all else.
