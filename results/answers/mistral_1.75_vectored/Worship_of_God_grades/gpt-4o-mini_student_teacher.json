  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer includes some relevant biblical passages and attempts to connect them to the importance of worshiping the true God. However, there are inaccuracies and misinterpretations present, such as the incorrect attribution of specific statements to certain biblical figures. Additionally, the response lacks a clear distinction between the worship of the true God and the dangers of idolatry. The student could benefit from deeper study and understanding of biblical teachings on worship and false gods."
