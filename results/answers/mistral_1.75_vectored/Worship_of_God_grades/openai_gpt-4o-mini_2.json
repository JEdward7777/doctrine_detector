  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of worshiping the true God, as stated in the Bible, and warning against idolatry. The mention of false gods as nonliving idols aligns with Christian beliefs about the worship of Yahweh alone. The response could be improved by providing more specific references to verses in the Bible that explicitly warn against idolatry and emphasize the worship of the true God."
