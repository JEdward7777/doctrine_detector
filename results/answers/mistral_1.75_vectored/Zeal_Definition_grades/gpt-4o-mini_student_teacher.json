  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a solid understanding of zeal in the context of Christian teachings, emphasizing the passion and dedication to serving God and spreading His love. The mention of zeal as a spiritual gift and its association with the Holy Spirit adds depth to the explanation. However, the student could improve by including more emphasis on actively promoting a good cause and obeying God as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a commendable response with room for slight improvement."
