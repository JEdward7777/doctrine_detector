However, it would have been beneficial to include more specific references to the Old Testament and the role of the high priest in the Day of Atonement, as well as the connection to the mercy seat and the shedding of blood for forgiveness of sins. Strengthening these foundational aspects would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the response."
