It addresses the concern by highlighting the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement, showing a good understanding of the Christian perspective on this theological concept. The only minor improvement would be to include a direct reference to the Old Testament scriptures that describe the role of the mercy seat in symbolizing God's mercy and atonement."
