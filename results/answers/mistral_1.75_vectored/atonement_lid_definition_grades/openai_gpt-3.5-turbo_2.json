It effectively addresses the concern regarding the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the Old Testament. However, it could have further emphasized the parallel between the atonement lid in the Ark of the Covenant and the ultimate sacrifice and redemption fulfilled by Jesus Christ in the New Testament to provide a more comprehensive Christian worldview perspective."
