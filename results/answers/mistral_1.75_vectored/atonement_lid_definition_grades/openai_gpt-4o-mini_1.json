  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 90. The student accurately identifies the atonement lid as the mercy seat and its significance in representing God's mercy in redeeming sinful humanity. The understanding of the high priest's role in meeting with Yahweh on behalf of the people is also well articulated. The explanation aligns well with Christian beliefs about atonement in the Old Testament. The only minor improvement would be to include more detail about how this symbolic representation of atonement foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice and redemption through Jesus Christ."
