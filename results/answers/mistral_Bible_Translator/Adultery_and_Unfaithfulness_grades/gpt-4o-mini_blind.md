## [Answer](../Adultery_and_Unfaithfulness.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of marriage as described in the Bible, the term 'unfaithful' is closely associated with infidelity or disloyalty towards one's spouse. The Old Testament (Leviticus 20:10) and New Testament (Matthew 19:9, Mark 10:11-12) both emphasize that God intends marriage to be a lifelong union between one man and one woman and that any sexual activity outside of this relationship is considered unfaithfulness. Additionally, the New Testament book of Hebrews (Hebrews 13:4) states that marriage should be honored by all, and the bed kept undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous. This teaching is reinforced throughout the Bible, emphasizing the importance of fidelity and loyalty within a marriage.
