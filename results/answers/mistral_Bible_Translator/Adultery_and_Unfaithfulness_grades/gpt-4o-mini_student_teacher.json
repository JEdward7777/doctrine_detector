  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student provided a solid understanding of the term 'unfaithful' in the context of marriage as described in the Bible by discussing infidelity and referencing relevant scriptures from both the Old and New Testaments. They also highlighted the importance of fidelity and loyalty within a marriage. However, the answer did not specifically address the concern raised in the reference answer regarding the parallel between marital unfaithfulness and Israel's unfaithfulness to God. Therefore, while the student demonstrated good knowledge and understanding, there was room for improvement in fully addressing the concern provided."
