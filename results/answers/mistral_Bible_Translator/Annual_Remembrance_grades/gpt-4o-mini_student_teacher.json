The answer is thorough, well-referenced, and aligns with the Christian principle of recognizing the importance of remembrance in faith. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the celebration of Passover to the Christian faith, perhaps by highlighting how the themes of deliverance and covenant in Passover point to Christ's ultimate sacrifice for humanity."
