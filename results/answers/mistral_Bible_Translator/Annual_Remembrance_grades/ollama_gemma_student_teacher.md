## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Bible (Exodus 12:14), the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover annually as a permanent ordinance (Hebrew: הַחֲגָה הַעוֹבֵרֶת, HaChagah HaOvereth). The reason behind this commandment is rooted in the story of the Exodus.

The Israelites were slaves in Egypt for over 400 years. God miraculously delivered them from their slavery by passing over (Hebrew: פַּסְחָה, Pesachah) the homes marked with the blood of a lamb, sparing the firstborn son of each Israelite family. This event serves as a reminder of God's mighty power and faithfulness to His people.

By celebrating Passover annually, the Israelites would remember their deliverance from Egypt, reaffirm their covenant with God, and pass on the story of the Exodus to future generations (Exodus 13:8). The Passover is also a time for thanksgiving, as it commemorates the beginning of the Israelites' journey towards the Promised Land.

The celebration includes unleavened bread (Matzo), symbolizing the haste with which the Israelites had to leave Egypt, and the remembrance of the lamb that was sacrificed on behalf of each family. The Passover Seder, a ritual meal held on the first and second nights of Passover, serves as an annual commemoration of this miraculous event.

In summary, the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year as a means of remembering their deliverance from slavery in Egypt, reaffirming their covenant with God, and passing on the story of the Exodus to future generations.
