## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Bible (Exodus 12:14), the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover annually as a permanent ordinance (Hebrew: הַחֲגָה הַעוֹבֵרֶת, HaChagah HaOvereth). The reason behind this commandment is rooted in the story of the Exodus.

The Israelites were slaves in Egypt for over 400 years. God miraculously delivered them from their slavery by passing over (Hebrew: פַּסְחָה, Pesachah) the homes marked with the blood of a lamb, sparing the firstborn son of each Israelite family. This event serves as a reminder of God's mighty power and faithfulness to His people.

By celebrating Passover annually, the Israelites would remember their deliverance from Egypt, reaffirm their covenant with God, and pass on the story of the Exodus to future generations (Exodus 13:8). The Passover is also a time for thanksgiving, as it commemorates the beginning of the Israelites' journey towards the Promised Land.

The celebration includes unleavened bread (Matzo), symbolizing the haste with which the Israelites had to leave Egypt, and the remembrance of the lamb that was sacrificed on behalf of each family. The Passover Seder, a ritual meal held on the first and second nights of Passover, serves as an annual commemoration of this miraculous event.

In summary, the Israelites were commanded to celebrate Passover every year as a means of remembering their deliverance from slavery in Egypt, reaffirming their covenant with God, and passing on the story of the Exodus to future generations.

Comment: The response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the significance of the Passover celebration for the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of remembrance in the context of God's victory and deliverance. It effectively ties in the Christian perspective on remembrance by highlighting how the Passover tradition serves as a means of reaffirming the covenant with God and passing on the story of the Exodus to future generations. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly connect the concept of remembrance to its broader significance in Christian faith beyond the specific context of the Passover celebration.
