The explanation could be enhanced by delving deeper into the doctrinal understanding of the Holy Spirit's role in sanctification and the indwelling of believers, as outlined in the New Testament teachings. Additionally, connecting the Old Testament practices of anointing with the New Testament fulfillment in Christ and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost would further enrich the response. Overall, a solid foundation is presented, but further theological depth and scriptural elaboration would strengthen the argument."
