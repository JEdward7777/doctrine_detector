## [Answer](../Antichrist_Identification.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Apostle John, in 1 John 2:18-26 and 4:1-3, the term "antichrist" (antiχριστός) refers to individuals or movements that deny the fundamental truths about Jesus Christ, especially those related to His divine nature and atonement. The antichrist denies Jesus Christ as the eternal Son of God who came in human form, was crucified for our sins, and rose from the dead.

In 1 John 2:22, it says, "Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son." In 2 John 7, the Apostle John warns about deceivers who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh.

It's important to note that the term "antichrist" doesn't refer to a specific individual or future figure prophesied to arise before Jesus returns. Rather, it is used to describe anyone who denies the essential teachings about Jesus Christ throughout history and in any context.
