  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate explanation of what defines a person as an antichrist according to the Apostle John. They have correctly highlighted the importance of denying fundamental truths about Jesus Christ, especially related to His divine nature and atonement. The biblical references provided support their explanation well. The student's response aligns well with the Christian worldview concerning recognizing and resisting false teachings about Jesus Christ."
