  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed response, effectively addressing the significance of Jesus sending the apostles to spread the Gospel in the context of the Great Commission. The answer elaborates on various key implications, such as mission continuation, authority and validation, universal reach, continuation of Jesus' ministry, and the formation of the Church. The student effectively connected these implications to Christian theology and the redemptive plan of God. However, the response could have directly addressed the reference answer provided by the teacher, focusing on conciseness and clarity while ensuring that the core message aligns closely with the Biblical truth of the apostles' mission."
