  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the significance of Jesus sending the apostles in the context of the Great Commission. It goes beyond a simple explanation and delves into the theological implications and broader implications of this event in Christian theology. The response effectively addresses the concern by discussing the authority, validation, universal reach, continuation of Jesus' ministry, and the formation of the Church through the apostles. The only minor improvement could be to directly quote the Bible verses to strengthen the biblical foundation of the points made."
