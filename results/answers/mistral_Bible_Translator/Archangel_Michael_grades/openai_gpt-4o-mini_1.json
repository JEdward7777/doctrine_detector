The response also appropriately discusses the different beliefs among Christian traditions regarding the identity of the archangel. The concern about recognizing Michael's unique position in influencing understanding of spiritual warfare and intercession could have been further elaborated on to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the implications within a Christian worldview. Overall, a strong response with a minor room for further development in addressing the concern."
