## Question [Archangel Michael](../../../questions/Archangel_Michael.md)
Who is the only angel referred to as an 'archangel' in the Bible?

## Correct Answer
The only angel referred to in the Bible as an 'archangel' is Michael.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing Michael's unique position can influence one's understanding of spiritual warfare and intercession.

## [Answer](../Archangel_Michael.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the identity of the specific archangel is not explicitly revealed. However, there are two instances where angels are collectively referred to as "archangels" in the New Testament (1 Thessalonians 4:16 and Jude 1:9). The most commonly associated with this title is Michael, who is mentioned by name several times in the Old Testament and is often considered an archangel based on these passages. However, it's essential to note that the Bible does not provide a clear answer as to who the only archangel is, and various Christian traditions have different beliefs regarding this matter.
