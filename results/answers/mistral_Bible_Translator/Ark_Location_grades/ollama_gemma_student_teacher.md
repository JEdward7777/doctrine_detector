 In the Holy of Holies, which was the most sacred room inside the Tabernacle according to Exodus 26:33-34 and Hebrews 9:3-5. The Ark of the Covenant was a chest that housed the Ten Commandments and represented God's presence among His people. Only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement, and even then, only after performing specific rituals to ensure his holiness.
