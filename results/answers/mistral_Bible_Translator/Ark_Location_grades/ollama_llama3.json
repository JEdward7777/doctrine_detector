The concern emphasizes understanding the presence of God, which this response does not fully address. While it mentions that the Ark represented God's presence, it could be further developed to show a clearer comprehension of the Holy of Holies as a sacred space where God dwelt among His people.\n\nTo improve, the response could have elaborated on the symbolic importance of the Ark and its role in representing God's presence, rather than simply stating its location."
