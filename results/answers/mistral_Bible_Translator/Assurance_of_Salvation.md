## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Bible, those who believe in Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord are assured of eternal life and salvation. This assurance comes primarily from John 3:16, where it is stated that "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

In addition to this, the Apostle Paul writes in Romans 8:38-39 that nothing can separate believers from the love of God in Christ Jesus: "For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

The book of 1 John also emphasizes the assurance of salvation for believers. In 1 John 5:13, it states, "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life."

This assurance is not based on our own works or efforts, but solely on faith in Jesus Christ and His finished work on the cross. As the Apostle Paul writes in Ephesians 2:8-9, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."

So, for those who believe in Jesus, they can have the assurance of eternal life and salvation based on God's promises and His grace.
