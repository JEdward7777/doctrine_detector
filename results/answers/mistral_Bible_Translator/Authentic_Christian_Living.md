## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Romans 12:9 (NIV), "Let love be genuine, and let us not pretend to love someone while hating them. Instead, each of you should love their neighbor as themselves." Therefore, to avoid hypocrisy in our love and actions, we should ensure that our love is sincere and genuine, not feigned or insincere, and we should treat others with the same compassion and care that we would want for ourselves. This means loving our neighbors, regardless of their background or circumstances, and striving to act consistently with these values in all areas of life.
