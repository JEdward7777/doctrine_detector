It accurately describes the belief that the Bible is God's inspired word and emphasizes its significance in guiding believers' lives. The integration of relevant biblical references adds strength to the answer. One minor suggestion for improvement would be to elaborate further on how divine authority impacts specific areas of a believer's life, such as relationships, ethics, and decision-making."
