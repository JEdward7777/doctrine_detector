  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of divine authority within Christian theology, emphasizing its significance in guiding believers' decisions, shaping beliefs, and fostering spiritual growth. The response effectively highlights the importance of divine authority as a source of truth and moral guidance for Christians. However, the answer could have further addressed the concern by explicitly connecting divine authority to helping believers discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the concept but could have aligned the response more closely with the specified concern."
