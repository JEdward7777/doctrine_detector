## [Answer](../Authority_in_Governance.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible addresses the relationship between governing authorities and citizens in various passages, primarily in the books of Exodus, Romans, and 1 Peter. Here are a few examples:

1. Exodus 18:21 - "Select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens." This passage encourages selecting just and upright leaders to govern the people.

2. Romans 13:1-7 - "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God... Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience." This passage suggests that governing authorities are ordained by God and therefore should be obeyed by citizens out of reverence for both authority and conscience.

3. 1 Peter 2:13-14 - "Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right." This passage encourages submission to civil authorities but also emphasizes that ultimate allegiance is to God.

These passages suggest that while governing authorities should be obeyed and respected as God's representatives, their authority is limited and should not infringe upon moral or religious convictions. It also encourages the selection of just and upright leaders who will govern with fairness and justice. Ultimately, the Bible emphasizes that citizens should always prioritize their relationship with God above any earthly authority.
