  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation by referencing relevant biblical passages such as Exodus 18:21, Romans 13:1-7, and 1 Peter 2:13-14. However, the student's answer could be improved by directly focusing on the specific concern provided, which was understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey. The student's answer covers a broader range of topics related to governing authorities and citizens, which slightly deviates from the specified concern."
