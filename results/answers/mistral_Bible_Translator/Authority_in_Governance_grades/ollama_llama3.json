  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern about understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey by mentioning Romans 13:1-2, which supports the idea that governing authorities are established by God. However, it does not fully develop this concept, as the passage also emphasizes the importance of conscience and the limitations of earthly authority.\n\nThe response could be improved by exploring more thoroughly how these passages intersect with one another (e.g., 1 Peter 2:13-14) and how they inform our understanding of the relationship between governing authorities and citizens. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more explicit discussion of what it means for citizens to prioritize their relationship with God above any earthly authority.\n\nOverall, while this response provides some relevant biblical support for its claims, it does not fully engage with the concern about understanding the God-ordained structure of authority and our responsibility to obey."
