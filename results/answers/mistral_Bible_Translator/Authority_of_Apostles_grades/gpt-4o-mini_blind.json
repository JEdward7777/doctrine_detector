The student accurately connects the apostles' authority to their commission from Jesus, their role as witnesses to His resurrection, and the empowerment they received from the Holy Spirit. The integration of relevant Bible passages such as Matthew 28:18-20 and Acts 1:8 further strengthens the argument. Well done!"
