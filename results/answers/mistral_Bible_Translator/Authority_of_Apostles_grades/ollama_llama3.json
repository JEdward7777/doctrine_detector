  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explores the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles for ministry, clearly articulating their unique roles in the ministry of Jesus Christ and their subsequent call to serve as witnesses to His resurrection. The discussion is well-supported by biblical references (Matthew 28:18-20, John 14:12, Acts 1:8, Acts 5:12), which helps to establish a strong foundation for the apostles' authority.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of highlighting the connection between the apostles' ability to perform miracles and their bold preaching, emphasizing that this authority came from their relationship with Jesus Christ, eyewitness accounts of His life, death, and resurrection, and subsequent commissioning by Him. The only area for improvement is the lack of a more explicit emphasis on the Gospel message being the foundation of the apostles' authority, which could be further developed to strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the divine empowerment and authority bestowed upon the apostles, and provides a solid foundation for exploring their ministry."
