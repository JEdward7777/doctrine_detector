## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The authority of the apostles, as understood within Christian theology, is rooted in their unique roles in the ministry of Jesus Christ and their subsequent call to serve as witnesses to His resurrection. This authority was not merely a personal or individual matter; rather, it was an authoritative commission from Jesus Himself, empowering them to preach the Gospel message (Matthew 28:18-20) and perform miracles in His name (John 14:12).

Their ability to perform miracles and preach boldly is directly related to their authority. The miraculous works they performed, such as healing the sick, casting out demons, and even raising the dead (Acts 5:12), served as confirmation of their message and authenticated their testimony. Their boldness in preaching was a result of the Holy Spirit's guidance and empowerment, as promised by Jesus (Acts 1:8).

In essence, the authority that allowed the apostles to perform miracles and preach boldly came from their unique relationship with Jesus Christ, their eyewitness accounts of His life, death, and resurrection, and their subsequent commissioning by Him. Their authority was grounded in the truth of the Gospel message they proclaimed and the validity of their experiences with God.
