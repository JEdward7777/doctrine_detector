It effectively articulates the root of the apostles' authority in their unique relationship with Jesus, their witness to His resurrection, and their commissioning by Him. The inclusion of relevant biblical references further strengthens the argument and demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic. Overall, a thorough and well-supported response. Great job!"
