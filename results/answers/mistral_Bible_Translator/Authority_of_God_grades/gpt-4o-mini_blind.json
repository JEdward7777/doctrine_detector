  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the term \"Yahweh of hosts\" in relation to God's authority over spiritual beings from a Christian worldview. The student effectively highlights key aspects such as omnipotence, holiness, sovereignty, protection, and judgment, emphasizing God's control over both physical and spiritual realms. The answer could have been strengthened by including more scriptural references to support each point and deepen the theological analysis further. Overall, well done."
