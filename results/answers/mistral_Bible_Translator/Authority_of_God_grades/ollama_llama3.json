For example, it would have been helpful to explain the concept of Yahweh's presence among the heavenly hosts underscoring His holiness and separateness from created beings. Additionally, some supporting biblical passages or examples would have strengthened the argument.\n\nOverall, while the response is clear and concise, it could benefit from further elaboration and biblical backing to fully address the concern and demonstrate a deeper understanding of God's authority."
