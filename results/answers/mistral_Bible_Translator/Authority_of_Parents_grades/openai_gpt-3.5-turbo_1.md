# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The concept of parental authority in the Bible is rooted in several key passages across both the Old and New Testaments. Here are some examples:

1) Exodus 20:12 - One of the Ten Commandments, this passage commands honor for parents: "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you."

2) Deuteronomy 5:16 - This reiterates the commandment to honor parents: "Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God commanded you, that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you."

3) Proverbs 23:13-14 - This passage encourages children to obey their parents: "Do not withhold discipline from a child; although you strike him with the rod, he will not die. You shall strike him with the rod and deliver his soul from hell."

4) Ephesians 6:1-4 (New Testament) - This passage instructs children to obey their parents: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother'—which is the first commandment with a promise— 'so that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.' Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord."

These passages suggest that parental authority is rooted in God's commandments, and obedience to parents (within reason and without abuse) is a sign of respect for both God and the parents. However, it is important to note that these scriptures also emphasize the importance of loving, caring, and nurturing parenting. The Bible does not condone harsh or abusive treatment of children. Instead, it encourages raising children in the knowledge of the Lord.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of parental authority in the Bible, citing relevant passages and emphasizing the importance of obedience to parents within a Christian framework. It acknowledges the significance of both Old and New Testament scriptures in guiding family dynamics. The connection between Ephesians 6:1-3 and the broader concept of parental authority based on biblical principles is well-articulated. The only area for improvement would be to further elaborate on how love and nurturing are essential components of parental authority in a Christian context.
