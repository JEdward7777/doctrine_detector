  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 90.\n\nThe student correctly identified several key figures involved in writing the Psalms, including King David, Moses, Asaph, Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman the Ezrahite, and Korah, aligning with a Christian perspective of various authors. While the student missed mentioning Solomon as one of the key figures according to the teacher's reference answer, their understanding of the diverse authorship of the Psalms and the acknowledgment of uncertain authorship is commendable. The mention of different authors and the explanation of the tradition of attribution add depth to their answer, enhancing the understanding of the diversity within the Psalms. Overall, a strong response but could have improved by including Solomon."
