## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Book of Psalms, as part of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), was written by various authors over a long period, approximately spanning from the 7th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. The traditional Jewish belief is that King David composed a significant number of them, which are often referred to as the "Psalms of David." However, other key figures who authored Psalms include Moses (Psalm 90), Asaph (Psalms 50 and 73-83), Ethan the Ezrahite (Psalm 89), Heman the Ezrahite (Psalm 88), and Korah (Psalm 42 & 43). It is important to note that the authorship of several Psalms remains uncertain, and the tradition of attribution is not always historically verifiable.

90.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's response as 90.

The student correctly identified several key figures involved in writing the Psalms, including King David, Moses, Asaph, Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman the Ezrahite, and Korah, aligning with a Christian perspective of various authors. While the student missed mentioning Solomon as one of the key figures according to the teacher's reference answer, their understanding of the diverse authorship of the Psalms and the acknowledgment of uncertain authorship is commendable. The mention of different authors and the explanation of the tradition of attribution add depth to their answer, enhancing the understanding of the diversity within the Psalms. Overall, a strong response but could have improved by including Solomon.
