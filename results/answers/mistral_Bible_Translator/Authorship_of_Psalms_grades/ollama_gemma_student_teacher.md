## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Book of Psalms, as part of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), was written by various authors over a long period, approximately spanning from the 7th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. The traditional Jewish belief is that King David composed a significant number of them, which are often referred to as the "Psalms of David." However, other key figures who authored Psalms include Moses (Psalm 90), Asaph (Psalms 50 and 73-83), Ethan the Ezrahite (Psalm 89), Heman the Ezrahite (Psalm 88), and Korah (Psalm 42 & 43). It is important to note that the authorship of several Psalms remains uncertain, and the tradition of attribution is not always historically verifiable.
