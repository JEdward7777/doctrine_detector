  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The provided response accurately identifies some key figures involved in writing the Psalms, such as King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph. However, the response lacks specificity in addressing the concern that recognizing the authorship of Psalms enhances understanding of their messages and themes. It would have been better if the response had elaborated on how the authorship of specific Psalms by different individuals provides insights into the context and significance of the messages conveyed in those Psalms. Adding more depth to the discussion would have improved the overall grade."
