## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Book of Psalms, as part of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), was written by various authors over a long period, approximately spanning from the 7th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. The traditional Jewish belief is that King David composed a significant number of them, which are often referred to as the "Psalms of David." However, other key figures who authored Psalms include Moses (Psalm 90), Asaph (Psalms 50 and 73-83), Ethan the Ezrahite (Psalm 89), Heman the Ezrahite (Psalm 88), and Korah (Psalm 42 & 43). It is important to note that the authorship of several Psalms remains uncertain, and the tradition of attribution is not always historically verifiable.

Comment: The response provides a good overview of the key figures involved in writing the Psalms, accurately mentioning King David, Moses, Asaph, and other authors. However, the mention of Solomon as an author is missing, which is a significant oversight. Understanding the authorship of the Psalms is crucial as it provides context and insight into the messages and themes conveyed in the text. It's important to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible when discussing the authorship of the Psalms from a Christian perspective.
