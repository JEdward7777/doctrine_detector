  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a generally accurate overview of the key figures involved in writing the Psalms, mentioning King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph. However, it fails to address other important authors like Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman the Ezrahite, and Korah. Additionally, the response acknowledges the uncertainty regarding authorship, which is a relevant point to consider. Overall, the response is informative but could be improved by including a more comprehensive list of authors."
