## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Book of Psalms, as part of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), was written by various authors over a long period, approximately spanning from the 7th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. The traditional Jewish belief is that King David composed a significant number of them, which are often referred to as the "Psalms of David." However, other key figures who authored Psalms include Moses (Psalm 90), Asaph (Psalms 50 and 73-83), Ethan the Ezrahite (Psalm 89), Heman the Ezrahite (Psalm 88), and Korah (Psalm 42 & 43). It is important to note that the authorship of several Psalms remains uncertain, and the tradition of attribution is not always historically verifiable.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a generally accurate overview of the key figures involved in writing the Psalms, mentioning King David, Moses, Solomon, and Asaph. However, it fails to address other important authors like Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman the Ezrahite, and Korah. Additionally, the response acknowledges the uncertainty regarding authorship, which is a relevant point to consider. Overall, the response is informative but could be improved by including a more comprehensive list of authors.
