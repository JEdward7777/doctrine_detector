## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Book of Psalms, as part of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), was written by various authors over a long period, approximately spanning from the 7th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. The traditional Jewish belief is that King David composed a significant number of them, which are often referred to as the "Psalms of David." However, other key figures who authored Psalms include Moses (Psalm 90), Asaph (Psalms 50 and 73-83), Ethan the Ezrahite (Psalm 89), Heman the Ezrahite (Psalm 88), and Korah (Psalm 42 & 43). It is important to note that the authorship of several Psalms remains uncertain, and the tradition of attribution is not always historically verifiable.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the key figures involved in writing the Psalms, including additional authors beyond those mentioned in the initial answer. The acknowledgment of uncertainty in authorship and the significance of attribution in understanding the Psalms align well with Christian perspectives on the importance of context and historical background in interpreting biblical texts. However, the response could have delved deeper into specific examples of how the authors' backgrounds and experiences influenced the messages and themes of the Psalms for a more nuanced analysis.
