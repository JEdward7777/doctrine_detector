  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the importance of the term \"Son of God\" in Christian theology and acknowledges the potential for misunderstanding in polytheistic cultures. The answer correctly emphasizes the need for accurate translation while considering cultural context. However, it lacks a firm stance on whether the term should be avoided in translations, which could have been addressed from a Christian worldview perspective. Additionally, more explicit reference to the unique and divine nature of Jesus Christ as the Son of God would have been beneficial. Overall, while the information provided is accurate, a clearer Christian perspective could have been incorporated for a higher grade."
