  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful analysis of the potential misunderstandings surrounding the term \"Son of God\" in polytheistic cultures and highlighted the importance of finding equivalent terms in translations. While the student did not explicitly take a stance on whether the term should be avoided or not, their discussion on the importance of accurate translation and cultural sensitivity aligns well with the reference answer. However, deducting points for not directly addressing the reference answer."
