However, by advocating for avoiding the term and relying solely on context and explanation, there is a risk of not fully addressing the concern raised about potential theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. A more balanced approach that incorporates careful teaching alongside translation efforts would better address this concern from a Christian worldview."
