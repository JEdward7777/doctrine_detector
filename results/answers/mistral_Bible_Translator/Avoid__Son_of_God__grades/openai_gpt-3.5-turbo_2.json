  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response appropriately addresses the concern raised by stating the importance of not avoiding the term \"Son of God\" in Bible translation. The explanation provided emphasizes the need for careful teaching and contextual understanding to prevent any theological misunderstandings. However, from a Christian perspective, the response could have further emphasized the unique and foundational significance of Jesus being the Son of God in Christian theology. Additionally, it could have more explicitly highlighted the potential dangers of avoiding key theological terms, which can indeed lead to significant gaps in understanding Jesus' identity."
