While the response suggests finding equivalent terms, it falls short of directly addressing the concern that avoidance can lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity. The emphasis on cultural sensitivity and collaboration with local scholars and church leaders is commendable but could be strengthened by affirming the significance of not avoiding key theological terms like \"Son of God\" in order to prevent potential misunderstandings."
