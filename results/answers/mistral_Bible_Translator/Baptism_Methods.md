## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, there are three primary accounts of baptism mentioned:

1. Baptism by Immersion (Matthew 3:16; Mark 1:9-10): John the Baptist practiced this method of baptism, where the candidate would be submerged in water. This is the preferred method for many Christian denominations, such as Baptists, Pentecostals, and some Methodists.

2. Baptism by Affusion (Acts 2:38; 8:36-39; 10:47-48): Also known as baptism by pouring or aspersion, this method involves the candidate being poured over with water. This is practiced in various Christian denominations such as Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Anglicans, and some Lutherans.

3. Baptism by Infusion (1 Corinthians 6:11): This type of baptism refers to a spiritual cleansing, without any physical water ritual. Some Protestant denominations, such as the Oneness Pentecostals, believe in this form of baptism, although it is not explicitly described in the Bible.

In various Christian contexts, these different methods can carry specific theological meanings:

- Baptism by Immersion often signifies the believer's identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. The act of being submerged underwater symbolizes dying to sin and rising again to a new life in Christ.

- Baptism by Affusion emphasizes the idea of washing away sins and receiving the Holy Spirit, although it may not be as strongly associated with Christ's death and burial as baptism by immersion.

- Baptism by Infusion is believed to occur at the moment of faith in Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, without any physical water ritual required. This understanding often places greater emphasis on personal faith and the internal transformation that occurs through that faith.
