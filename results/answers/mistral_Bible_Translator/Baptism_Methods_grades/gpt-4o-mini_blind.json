  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a good overview of the different methods of baptism described in the Bible and offers a brief explanation of their significance in various Christian contexts. However, there are a few doctrinal inaccuracies and missing details that need to be addressed. Specifically, there is no mention of the significance of baptism in relation to the forgiveness of sins and the role of baptism in the believer's public declaration of faith. Additionally, the explanation of Baptism by Infusion is not in line with orthodox Christian beliefs, as baptism is typically understood as a physical ceremony involving water rather than solely a spiritual cleansing. The student also could have expanded on the theological differences between denominations regarding the mode and meaning of baptism."
