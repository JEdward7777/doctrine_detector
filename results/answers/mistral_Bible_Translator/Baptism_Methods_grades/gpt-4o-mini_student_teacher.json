  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-structured and detailed explanation of the different methods of baptism mentioned in the Bible and how they are interpreted in various Christian contexts. They have effectively cited relevant Bible verses and demonstrated an understanding of the theological significance behind each method. However, the student could have provided a more concise summary at the beginning of the response to align more closely with the reference answer. Overall, a strong effort in addressing the concern raised."
