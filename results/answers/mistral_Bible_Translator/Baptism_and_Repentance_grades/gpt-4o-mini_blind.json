The student correctly highlights the importance of both repentance and baptism in the process of salvation and becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ. The connection to Acts 2:38 is well-explained, and the emphasis on repentance as a change of heart leading to turning away from sin is doctrinally sound. The statement regarding the role of baptism in symbolizing death to sin and new life in Christ is also well articulated. Additionally, the student correctly emphasizes that baptism is not the means of salvation itself but a public declaration of faith and obedience to God. Overall, this is a solid response with a strong doctrinal foundation."
