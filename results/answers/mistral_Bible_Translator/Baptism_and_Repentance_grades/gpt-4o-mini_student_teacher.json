  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the close relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine, drawing on scripture to support their explanation. They accurately explain the concept of repentance as turning away from sin and turning towards God, and the symbolic significance of baptism as an outward expression of this internal change. Additionally, they correctly highlight that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism in Christian practice. The student effectively integrates Biblical references to support their points, demonstrating a good grasp of the topic. However, the student could further strengthen their response by explicitly stating that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
