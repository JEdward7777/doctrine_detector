## [Answer](../Baptism_and_Repentance.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, repentance and baptism are closely linked as two important steps towards salvation and becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ. The book of Acts (2:38) clearly shows this connection when Peter says to the crowd on Pentecost, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins."

Repentance is a fundamental act of turning away from sin and turning toward God. It involves sincere regret for past sins and a determination to live a life pleasing to God. Baptism, on the other hand, is an outward expression of this internal change. It symbolizes death to sin and new life in Christ. Through baptism, we publicly declare our faith in Jesus and our commitment to follow Him.

In Acts 2:38, Peter does not say that baptism saves us, but rather that it is for the forgiveness of sins. This implies that repentance (turning from sin) is a necessary prerequisite for baptism, as well as for the forgiveness of sins. Baptism itself does not save, but it is an essential part of obedience to God and a testament to our faith in Jesus Christ.

So, in summary, repentance is a change of heart that leads us to turn away from sin and turn toward God. Baptism is the public declaration of this change and our commitment to follow Jesus. Both are important steps for those who wish to become disciples of Christ and receive forgiveness of their sins.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provides a solid understanding of the close relationship between repentance and baptism in Christian doctrine, drawing on scripture to support their explanation. They accurately explain the concept of repentance as turning away from sin and turning towards God, and the symbolic significance of baptism as an outward expression of this internal change. Additionally, they correctly highlight that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism in Christian practice. The student effectively integrates Biblical references to support their points, demonstrating a good grasp of the topic. However, the student could further strengthen their response by explicitly stating that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher.
