  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe response accurately explains the connection between repentance and baptism, citing relevant biblical passages (Acts 2:38) and providing clear definitions for both concepts. The writer also correctly emphasizes that repentance is a necessary prerequisite for baptism, and that baptism itself does not save, but rather serves as a public declaration of one's faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in its clarity regarding the precise nature of salvation. While it is correct to say that repentance is a prerequisite for baptism, it would be helpful to further clarify how these two elements fit into the larger Christian doctrine of salvation (e.g., what role does faith play? What is the relationship between justification and sanctification?). However, given the concern about understanding the relationship between repentance and baptism, this response is largely successful in addressing that concern.\n\nOverall, a strong effort!"
