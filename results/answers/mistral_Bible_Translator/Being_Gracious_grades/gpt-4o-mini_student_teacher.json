  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"gracious\" in Christian theology and connected it well to interactions with others. They highlighted the importance of forgiveness, kindness, and empathy in relationships, reflecting the Christian obligation to show grace as demonstrated by God through Jesus Christ. The answer aligned closely with the teacher's reference answer, but could have been slightly improved by focusing more directly on the aspect of extending kindness and forgiveness to those who have wronged us, as per the specified concern."
