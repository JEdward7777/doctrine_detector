The integration of Old Testament scriptures and Jewish beliefs adds depth to the explanation. However, it would be beneficial to emphasize the Pharisees' strict adherence to the Law and the oral traditions in shaping their beliefs, as this aspect is crucial to understanding Pharisaic teachings. Additionally, acknowledging the differences between Pharisaic beliefs and Christian interpretations would further enhance the analysis. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
