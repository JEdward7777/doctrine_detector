  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer that aligns with the Christian worldview by incorporating specific biblical references and explaining how the Pharisees' beliefs in resurrection and spiritual beings are depicted in the New Testament. The student also acknowledged the limitations of solely relying on the New Testament and highlighted the importance of considering broader historical and Jewish literature for a comprehensive understanding. The answer effectively addresses the concern of enhancing understanding of the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly referencing the concern in the conclusion to tie back to the initial focus of the question."
