## [Answer](../Beliefs_of_the_Pharisees.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, the Pharisees are often portrayed as believing in the resurrection of the dead and the existence of spiritual beings, particularly angels. However, it is important to note that the New Testament provides us with a Christian perspective on the Pharisees' beliefs, and our understanding should be nuanced considering the historical context and the Jewish literature available from that time period.

The Pharisees believed in an afterlife where the righteous would be resurrected and rewarded with eternal life in the World to Come (Olam Haba), while the wicked would suffer eternal punishment. This belief was based on Old Testament scriptures, such as Daniel 12:2, which states, "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."

Regarding spiritual beings, the Pharisees believed in angels (mal'akhim) and demons (shedim). Angels were viewed as messengers of God who carried out His will, while demons were thought to be fallen angels that had been cast out of heaven. This belief is evident in passages like Matthew 25:41, where Jesus speaks of the punishment for the wicked: "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'"

It is also worth mentioning that the Pharisees believed in the concept of sheol, which was a shadowy underworld where all the dead resided, regardless of their righteousness. However, they did not hold a strong belief in the immortality of souls before the resurrection, as they considered the body and soul to be united and only the resurrected body would attain eternal life in the World to Come.

Overall, while our understanding of the Pharisees' beliefs regarding life after death and spiritual beings is shaped by the Christian New Testament, it is essential to consider the broader context and Jewish literature from that time period for a more complete picture.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'm grading this response based on the concern to explore the Pharisees' beliefs in life after death and spiritual beings, as well as the provided answer.

Grade: 85

This response goes beyond the simple statement that the Pharisees believed in life after death and spiritual beings by providing a more nuanced understanding of their specific beliefs. The writer discusses the Pharisees' views on resurrection, eternal life, angels, demons, sheol, and the relationship between body and soul. This level of detail helps to shed light on the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time, which aligns with the concern.

However, while the response provides a good overview of Pharisaic beliefs, it could be improved by more explicitly connecting these beliefs to their implications for understanding Jesus' ministry and message. Additionally, some of the language and phrasing is academic and not particularly engaging or accessible to a general audience. Nonetheless, the response does an excellent job of exploring the Pharisees' beliefs in life after death and spiritual beings, making it a strong grade.

Comment: This response could be further enhanced by incorporating more explicit connections between the Pharisees' beliefs and Jesus' ministry, as well as using more engaging language to convey complex ideas.
