 In the New Testament letters to Christian churches, the term "beloved" (Greek: ἀγαπητοί, agapetoi) is a term of endearment and affection that underscores the deep love between God and His people, as well as among the members of the Christian community. It signifies a special relationship based on faith in Jesus Christ.

For example, in 1 John 2:7, it says, "Dear friends, I am writing you no new commandment but one we have had from the beginning: Love one another." Here, the term 'dear friends' or 'beloved' refers to the Christian community as a whole.

Similarly, in Galatians 6:18, Apostle Paul writes, "May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation." Here, the term 'beloved' is used to address the Galatian believers as an expression of love and affirmation.

Overall, the use of the term "beloved" in the New Testament letters serves to strengthen the bond between God and His people, and among the members of the Christian community, emphasizing the importance of love, fellowship, and unity in faith.
