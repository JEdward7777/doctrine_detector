1. Salvation: Sharing "in Christ" means having a personal relationship with Him, which brings salvation (Acts 2:38, Romans 6:23). Through faith in Jesus Christ, believers receive forgiveness for sins and eternal life (John 3:16, Ephesians 2:8-9).

2. Sanctification: Sharing "in Christ" means being set apart for God's purpose and growing in holiness (2 Corinthians 5:17, 1 Thessalonians 4:3). This process is facilitated by the indwelling Holy Spirit who helps us overcome sin and become more like Jesus.

3. Fellowship with God: Sharing "in Christ" means having a close relationship with the Father through His Son (John 17:3, Ephesians 3:14-21). This fellowship allows believers to commune with God in prayer and worship.

4. Assurance of Salvation: Sharing "in Christ" means having the assurance that one's sins are forgiven and that eternal life is secure (John 10:28-29, Romans 8:38-39). This confidence provides peace and hope amidst life's trials.

5. Community with Believers: Sharing "in Christ" means being part of the body of Christ, the Church (Ephesians 1:22-23, Hebrews 10:24-25). This community offers support, encouragement, and accountability as believers grow together in their faith.

6. Spiritual Gifts: Sharing "in Christ" means receiving spiritual gifts to build up the Church and serve others (Romans 12:6-8, 1 Corinthians 12:4-7). These gifts allow believers to fulfill their roles within the body of Christ effectively.

7. Victory over Sin: Sharing "in Christ" means being empowered to overcome sin and live a life pleasing to God (Romans 6, Galatians 5:16-25). This victory is possible through the power of the Holy Spirit who strengthens believers in their walk with Christ.

8. Hope for the Future: Sharing "in Christ" means looking forward to the return of Jesus and the establishment of His kingdom (Titus 2:13, Revelation 21-22). This hope provides encouragement and motivation for believers as they live out their faith in this present world.

9. Inheritance: Sharing "in Christ" means receiving an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading (1 Peter 1:3-5, Ephesians 1:18). This inheritance includes eternal life with God in heaven, as well as the blessings and promises contained throughout Scripture.

10. Transformation: Sharing "in Christ" means being transformed into His likeness, becoming more like Jesus daily (2 Corinthians 3:18, Romans 8:29). This transformation brings glory to God and enables believers to live lives that reflect His character and nature.
