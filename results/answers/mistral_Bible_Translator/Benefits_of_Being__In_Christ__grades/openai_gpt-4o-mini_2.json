While these aspects touch on the practical implications of a relationship with Christ, the original answer could have been enriched by incorporating more specific details and examples from the provided biblical passages and content to further illustrate how these benefits manifest in believers' lives. Strengthening the response with deeper theological insights and personal applications would have enhanced the understanding of the practical implications of a relationship with Christ."
