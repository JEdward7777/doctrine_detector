  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate list of Bible verses emphasizing forgiveness among believers. They appropriately explained the importance of forgiveness and how it reflects God's forgiveness towards us. However, the student missed highlighting Ephesians 4:31-32 specifically, which was mentioned in the reference answer. Otherwise, their answer aligns well with the Christian worldview in emphasizing forgiveness as a central tenet of the faith."
