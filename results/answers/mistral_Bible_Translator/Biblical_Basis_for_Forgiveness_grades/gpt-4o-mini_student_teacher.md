1. Matthew 6:14-15 (ESV): "For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."

2. Matthew 18:21-22 (ESV): "Then Peter came up and said to him, 'Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?' Jesus said to him, 'I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.'"

3. Mark 11:25 (ESV): "And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."

4. Colossians 3:13 (ESV): "Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."

5. Ephesians 4:32 (NIV): "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

These verses emphasize the importance of forgiveness among individuals and stress that true followers of Christ should imitate Him by extending forgiveness to others. The forgiveness given by God through Jesus Christ serves as an example for believers to extend grace, mercy, and forgiveness to one another.

Grade: 90

Comment: The student provided a thorough and accurate list of Bible verses emphasizing forgiveness among believers. They appropriately explained the importance of forgiveness and how it reflects God's forgiveness towards us. However, the student missed highlighting Ephesians 4:31-32 specifically, which was mentioned in the reference answer. Otherwise, their answer aligns well with the Christian worldview in emphasizing forgiveness as a central tenet of the faith.
