1. Matthew 6:14-15 (ESV): "For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses."

2. Matthew 18:21-22 (ESV): "Then Peter came up and said to him, 'Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?' Jesus said to him, 'I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times.'"

3. Mark 11:25 (ESV): "And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."

4. Colossians 3:13 (ESV): "Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."

5. Ephesians 4:32 (NIV): "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

These verses emphasize the importance of forgiveness among individuals and stress that true followers of Christ should imitate Him by extending forgiveness to others. The forgiveness given by God through Jesus Christ serves as an example for believers to extend grace, mercy, and forgiveness to one another.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response does identify some key verses that support the practice of forgiveness among believers, including Matthew 6:14-15, which is a crucial passage on the topic. However, it falls short in fully capturing the scope and importance of forgiveness as emphasized throughout Scripture.

While Ephesians 4:31-32 is mentioned, it's an incorrect reference (the actual verse says "forgiving each other" instead of "forgiveing one another"), which deducts from the overall grade. Additionally, Colossians 3:12-14 is not a relevant passage for this topic.

To earn a higher grade, the response could have included more comprehensive scriptural support and analysis on the importance of forgiveness in Christian relationships, as well as a clearer connection to the concern about identifying scripture that supports the practice of forgiveness.
