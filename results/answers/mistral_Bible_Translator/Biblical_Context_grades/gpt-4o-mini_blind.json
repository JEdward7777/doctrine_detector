The student accurately outlines the qualifications and duties of deacons as serving the community with wisdom, humility, and integrity. However, the response could be enhanced by emphasizing the spiritual aspect of the deacon's role in terms of serving and leading in the church under the authority of the elders. Additionally, connecting the role of deacons to the broader theme of servant-leadership within the church would further enrich the explanation."
