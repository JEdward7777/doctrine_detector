  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the responsibilities of deacons as described in Acts 6:1-7 and 1 Timothy 3:8-13. However, the student did not explicitly address the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community as specified in the reference answer. While the student highlighted the service aspect of deacons in caring for widows, they could have specifically connected this to the broader concept of fair treatment within the church community. The answer demonstrates good knowledge but lacks focus on the specific concern provided."
