## [Answer](../Biblical_Context.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, the role and responsibilities of deacons are described primarily in Acts 6:1-7 and 1 Timothy 3:8-13.

In Acts 6:1-7, we find that the first deacons were chosen to help with the daily distribution of food among the Greek-speaking widows. The qualifications for these deacons included being filled with the Spirit and wisdom, having a good reputation, being full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and being blameless before God and the community.

In 1 Timothy 3:8-13, the Apostle Paul provides more detailed instructions for the qualifications of deacons. They should be well thought of by outsiders, the husband of one wife, self-controlled, respectable, sensible, honest, hospitable, and able to teach. Deacons are also to manage God's household well, not being a new convert, and they must hold firmly to the mystery of their faith with a clear conscience.

These passages suggest that deacons should serve the community, particularly the vulnerable, with wisdom, humility, and integrity. They should be faithful followers of Jesus Christ, living according to His teachings, and helping to maintain order and unity within the church.
