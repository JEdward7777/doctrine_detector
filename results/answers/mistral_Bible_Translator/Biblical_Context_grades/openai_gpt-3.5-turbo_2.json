The connection between the deacons' role in ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community aligns well with a Christian worldview centered on justice, compassion, and stewardship. However, to achieve a perfect score, it could further emphasize the spiritual qualifications and character traits of deacons as outlined in Acts 6 and 1 Timothy 3."
