  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided well-known biblical examples of humility in Jesus Christ, Moses, and King David. However, the student did not focus solely on the humility aspect but also mentioned other characteristics or actions of these individuals. The focus should have been on tangible examples of humility specifically. Additionally, the student's explanation for Moses lacked depth and connection to the theme of humility. It would have been more effective to elaborate on Moses' humility rather than his obedience to God's command."
