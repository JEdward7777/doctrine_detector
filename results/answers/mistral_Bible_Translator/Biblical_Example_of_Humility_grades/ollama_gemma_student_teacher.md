 Absolutely! One biblical character who exemplified humility is Jesus Christ Himself. In Philippians 2:5-8, it says, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross."

Another example is Moses. In Numbers 12:3, God speaks to Moses' family saying, "Now therefore hear my voice, if at all will I make you a great nation. Now therefore go, and I will be with your heart and will be your God." Here we see that even though Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, he remained humble and obedient to God's command.

Finally, there is King David, who in Psalm 51:17 says, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." Although he was anointed as king and a man after God's own heart, David acknowledged his sin and humbled himself before the Lord.
