  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response provides three specific biblical examples of humility, including Jesus Christ, Moses, and King David. Each example is grounded in scripture, with direct quotes from Philippians, Numbers, and Psalm 51. The response also highlights the connection between these biblical characters' humility and their trust and obedience to God. This meets the concern of finding tangible examples of humility in the scriptures.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the response could be strengthened by a more explicit explanation of what makes these examples humbling. For instance, one could elaborate on how Jesus' willingness to take on human form and suffer death on the cross is an example of extraordinary humility, or how David's acknowledgment of his sin and repentance demonstrate a humble spirit.\n\nOverall, however, this response effectively addresses the concern and provides concrete examples from scripture to illustrate the concept of humility."
