The examples provided are well-referenced and effectively support the assertion that David is an example of a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of humility within a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern by providing tangible examples from the scriptures. Great job!"
