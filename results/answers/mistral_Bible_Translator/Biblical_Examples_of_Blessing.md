## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Absolutely! One of the most well-known examples of God blessing creation can be found in Genesis 1:28, which says, "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.'"

In this verse, God is blessing Adam and Eve (the first humans) as He gives them stewardship over the earth and all its creatures. This blessing allows them to fulfill their role in multiplying and caring for the creation.

Another example can be found in Genesis 8:20-21, after the great flood. Noah, his family, and the animals that survived built an altar and offered sacrifices to God. In response, God made a covenant with Noah and his descendants, saying, "And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."

This verse shows God's continuing blessing upon creation through His covenantal relationship with humanity. The rainbow serves as a symbol of this blessing and His promise to never again destroy the earth by flood.
