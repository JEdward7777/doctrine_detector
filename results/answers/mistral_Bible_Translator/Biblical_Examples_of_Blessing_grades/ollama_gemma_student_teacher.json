  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** The student provides well-reasoned and biblical examples to support their claim that God blesses creation. They correctly identify relevant verses and clearly explain how the blessings relate to human stewardship and God's covenant with creation. The inclusion of the rainbow as a symbol of God's blessing is also insightful. \n\nWhile the response is commendable, it could benefit from additional elaboration on the concept of stewardship and how it relates to responsible care for the environment."
