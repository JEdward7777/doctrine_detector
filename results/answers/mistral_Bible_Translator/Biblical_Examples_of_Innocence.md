Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Absolutely! In the Holy Bible, there are several instances where the idea of innocence, especially as it pertains to Jesus and His accusers, is clearly demonstrated. Here are a few examples:

1. Matthew 27:19 (ESV) - "While he was being accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing." This verse shows that Jesus stood silent before His accusers because He had no sin to confess.

2. Luke 23:4 (ESV) - "But Pilate asked him, 'Are you the King of the Jews?' He answered him, 'You have said so.'" In this passage, Jesus acknowledges that Pilate's words are true in a prophetic sense rather than admitting to any wrongdoing.

3. John 18:34 (ESV) - "Jesus answered, 'It is written, "My kingdom is not of this world."'" Jesus here asserts His innocence by stating that He does not hold political power or seek it, in contrast to the charges against Him.

4. Matthew 26:63-64 (ESV) - "But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, 'I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.' Jesus said to him, 'You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.'" In this encounter, Jesus neither denies nor confesses being the Messiah outright but instead refers to prophetic passages about His future glory.

5. Acts 23:4-5 (ESV) - "Then Paul said, 'I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city. At home or abroad, I always try to make myself a man without causing offense.' And as he spoke for a long time, the Jews listened enthusiastically and said in reply, 'Well spoken! You are not persuading us to abandon our views.'" Here, the Apostle Paul demonstrates his innocence by living a blameless life among both Jews and Gentiles.

These passages illustrate the idea of innocence in Christian theology, particularly as it relates to Jesus and His accusers, showcasing their steadfastness in the face of false accusations and unjust trials.
