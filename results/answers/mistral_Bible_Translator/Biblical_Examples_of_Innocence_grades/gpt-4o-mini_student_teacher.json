  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of relevant Scripture passages that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly in relation to Jesus and his accusers. The examples given effectively demonstrate Jesus' innocence through his responses to various accusations and trials. However, the teacher's reference answer may have slightly edged out the student's response by including a more focused and specific example directly related to Jesus' innocence. Nonetheless, the student's answer is thorough and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview perspective."
