  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of innocence in Christian theology, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers. They provide well-chosen and relevant examples from Scripture to support their claims. The clarity and coherence of their response are commendable. However, including the reference answer provided by the teacher would have strengthened the overall strength of the response."
