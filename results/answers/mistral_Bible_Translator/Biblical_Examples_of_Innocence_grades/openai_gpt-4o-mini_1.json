  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation supported by various relevant Bible passages that demonstrate the concept of innocence, particularly in the context of Jesus and His accusers. The examples are well-analyzed and align with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the innocence of Jesus in the face of false accusations. The additional passages cited further enrich the discussion on innocence within Christian theology. The response effectively addresses the concern raised. Great job!"
