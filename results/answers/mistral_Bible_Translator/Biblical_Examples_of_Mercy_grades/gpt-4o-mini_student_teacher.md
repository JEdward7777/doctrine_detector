1. The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32): This parable tells the story of a young man who squanders his inheritance in a distant land, but eventually returns home to his father's mercy and welcome.

2. Jonah and Nineveh (Jonah 3): God sent the prophet Jonah to warn the city of Nineveh about its impending destruction. Upon hearing Jonah's message, the King of Nineveh ordered the people to fast and put on sackcloth, turning from their evil ways. When the people of Nineveh demonstrated repentance, God showed mercy and did not destroy the city.

3. The Story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17): After David killed Goliath, King Saul wanted to kill him out of jealousy. Instead, David appealed to Saul's mercy, saying "What have I done now? What is my guilt? And what is my sin that I should be in danger of death?" (1 Samuel 24:10).

4. The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:21-35): This parable teaches about forgiveness, which is closely related to mercy. A servant who owed his master a great deal was unable to repay and begged for more time. Moved by compassion, the master forgave him. However, the servant went out and found a fellow servant who owed him a small amount, and demanded immediate payment. When the fellow servant could not pay, the first servant had him thrown in prison. Hearing about this, the master was angry and handed the first servant over to be tortured until he paid back everything he owed. In this story, God is depicted as the compassionate master who forgives those who repent and ask for mercy.

5. Jesus healing the leper (Matthew 8:1-4): A leper came and knelt before Jesus and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." Moved with pity, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the leper, saying, "I am willing; be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.

These stories illustrate God's mercy towards humanity, as well as the expectation that believers should extend mercy to others.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 75.

While the student provided relevant examples from the Bible to illustrate the concept of mercy, their answer could be enhanced by incorporating additional examples such as the mercy shown by the Persian Empire to conquered peoples and Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan, as suggested in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Including these additional examples would have further enriched the understanding of mercy through scriptural references and real-life applications. Nonetheless, the student's answer demonstrates a good grasp of key examples of mercy from the Bible and the importance of extending mercy to others.
