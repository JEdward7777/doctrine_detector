1. The Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32): This parable tells the story of a young man who squanders his inheritance in a distant land, but eventually returns home to his father's mercy and welcome.

2. Jonah and Nineveh (Jonah 3): God sent the prophet Jonah to warn the city of Nineveh about its impending destruction. Upon hearing Jonah's message, the King of Nineveh ordered the people to fast and put on sackcloth, turning from their evil ways. When the people of Nineveh demonstrated repentance, God showed mercy and did not destroy the city.

3. The Story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17): After David killed Goliath, King Saul wanted to kill him out of jealousy. Instead, David appealed to Saul's mercy, saying "What have I done now? What is my guilt? And what is my sin that I should be in danger of death?" (1 Samuel 24:10).

4. The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:21-35): This parable teaches about forgiveness, which is closely related to mercy. A servant who owed his master a great deal was unable to repay and begged for more time. Moved by compassion, the master forgave him. However, the servant went out and found a fellow servant who owed him a small amount, and demanded immediate payment. When the fellow servant could not pay, the first servant had him thrown in prison. Hearing about this, the master was angry and handed the first servant over to be tortured until he paid back everything he owed. In this story, God is depicted as the compassionate master who forgives those who repent and ask for mercy.

5. Jesus healing the leper (Matthew 8:1-4): A leper came and knelt before Jesus and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." Moved with pity, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the leper, saying, "I am willing; be clean." And immediately the leprosy left him.

These stories illustrate God's mercy towards humanity, as well as the expectation that believers should extend mercy to others.

Grade: 85

Comment: This response effectively uses scriptural references to illustrate the concept of mercy in various biblical stories, tying them back to the overarching theme of God's mercy towards humanity and the expectation for believers to show mercy to others. However, it could have been slightly improved by incorporating real-life applications or examples to further enhance the understanding of mercy in a practical context.
