  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided well-chosen examples from the Bible that illustrate the power and importance of prayer. The examples they used effectively demonstrated how prayer can bring miraculous answers, provide strength and protection, help cope with difficult situations, and lead to greater understanding of God's will. However, the student could have incorporated more diverse examples like the ones provided in the reference answer to further enrich the response."
