## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Transgression, in a biblical context, refers to violating God's laws or going beyond the established boundaries that He has set for human behavior. Here are several verses from both the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament that illustrate this concept:

1. Genesis 3:6-7 - This passage tells the story of Adam and Eve's transgression in eating the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, which led to their expulsion from the Garden of Eden.
2. Exodus 20:17 - The Ten Commandments include the prohibition against "coveting" or desiring what belongs to someone else, which can be seen as a form of transgression.
3. Psalm 51:4 - In this verse, King David confesses his transgressions before God and asks for forgiveness.
4. Isaiah 1:2-3 - These verses speak of the Israelites' transgressions against God, who calls them to "learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause."
5. Matthew 15:19 - In this passage from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, He says, "For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander." These actions are all examples of transgressing against God's will.
6. Romans 3:23 - The Apostle Paul writes, "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." This verse emphasizes that everyone has transgressed God's laws in some way.
7. James 2:10 - In this passage, James warns against being a "transgressor" by favoring one person over another, suggesting that all forms of prejudice and discrimination are examples of transgression.
8. Revelation 22:14 - This verse promises that those who keep God's commandments will have the right to the tree of life and enter the Holy City, but it also warns against those who practice "abominations, who by their abominations desecrate my [God's] name." In this context, abominations can be seen as transgressions against God's will.
