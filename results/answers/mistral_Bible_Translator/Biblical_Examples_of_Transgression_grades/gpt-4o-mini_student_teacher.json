  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-researched list of biblical references that illustrate the concept of transgression. However, the student missed including some key references that the teacher provided, such as 1 Thessalonians 4:6, Daniel 9:24-25, and Psalm 32:1. Therefore, while the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept and provided relevant examples, there is room for improvement in aligning their response more closely with the specific references given by the teacher."
