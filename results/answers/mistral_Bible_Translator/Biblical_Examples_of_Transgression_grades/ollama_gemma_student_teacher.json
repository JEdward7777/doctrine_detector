They provide several relevant biblical references from both the Old and New Testaments to illustrate different types of transgression. The student also demonstrates an ability to connect the concept of transgression to the idea of violating God's laws or going beyond established boundaries. The inclusion of references to both individual sins and societal injustices adds depth to the analysis."
