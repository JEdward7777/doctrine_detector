 Yes, I can certainly provide some examples of where trespass is mentioned in the Bible and discuss the moral or spiritual lessons they convey.

1. The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:23-35) - In this parable, a servant who owed his master an immense debt (ten thousand talents) was unable to repay and begged for mercy. Moved with compassion, the master forgave him the entire debt. However, when the servant encountered a fellow servant who owed him a small amount (hundred denarii), he refused to forgive and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay. Hearing about this, the master was angered and handed the unforgiving servant over to the jailers until he should pay all that he owed. This parable emphasizes the importance of extending forgiveness in response to having received it, as well as the consequences of withholding forgiveness.

2. The Trespass Against Moses (Exodus 16:2-4, Numbers 11:4-15) - In these passages, the Israelites grumbled and complained against Moses and Aaron for bringing them out of Egypt to die in the wilderness. God heard their complaints and was deeply displeased with them. This episode illustrates the danger of ungratefulness and ingratitude towards God's provision and leadership, as well as the consequences of discontentment and complaining against those whom He has appointed as leaders.

3. The Trespass Against Jesus (Matthew 5:21-26) - In this passage, Jesus teaches about trespasses in the context of anger and disputes among brothers. He explains that if you are angry with your brother without a cause, you have already committed murder in your heart. This shows that even though the act may not be carried out physically, harboring malice or hatred towards another is still a sin.

4. The Trespass Against Peter (Matthew 16:21-23) - After Jesus told Peter that He would suffer many things and be killed, and on the third day be raised to life, Peter took Him aside and rebuked Him. Jesus then turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; for you are not setting your mind on God, but on man." This episode demonstrates that even well-intentioned advice can be a spiritual trespass if it is given with the wrong motivation and without consideration of God's will.

In each of these examples, trespasses reveal moral or spiritual lessons about the importance of forgiveness, gratitude, humility, and discernment. By examining these instances, we can better understand how to live a life pleasing to God and grow in our relationship with Him.
