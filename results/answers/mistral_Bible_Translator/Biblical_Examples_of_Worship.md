## Question [Biblical Examples of Worship](../../questions/Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md)
Can you identify an example from the Bible where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship?

## Target answer from notes
One example is in Exodus 20:3, where God commands, 'Do not worship other gods,' contrasting the worship of Yahweh with the worship of idols practiced by others.

## Concern to grade by
This highlights the importance of avoiding idolatry and remaining faithful to God's commands in worship.

## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Yes, one example can be found in the Old Testament book of Exodus, chapter 20, verses 4-5: "You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God."

In this passage, the Lord (Yahweh) directly commands the Israelites not to make idols and worship them. This is contrasted with the correct form of worship which is exclusively reserved for Him. Idol worship, in this context, is seen as a grave sin because it violates the first commandment by making other objects or beings an object of worship instead of God.

Another example can be found in Deuteronomy 4:15-19 where Moses warns the Israelites not to forge gods of silver and gold, and not to bow down to them, serve them, or offer sacrifices to them. Instead, they are to cling to the LORD their God, remember His greatness, strength, and awesome works, and never forget that He is the only true God.

In both cases, the Bible contrasts worship of false idols with the proper worship of the one true God, emphasizing the importance of monotheism in the religious life of God's people.
