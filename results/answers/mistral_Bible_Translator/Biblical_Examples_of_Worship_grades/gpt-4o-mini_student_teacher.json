  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 90. \n\nThe student effectively identified two passages from the Bible, Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 4, where worship is negatively contrasted with idol worship, providing insightful explanations and contextualizing the importance of avoiding idolatry and staying faithful to God's commands in worship. The student also correctly highlighted the significance of monotheism in both instances. \n\nThe student's response shows a strong understanding of the specific concern provided, and they effectively connected the examples from the Bible to the importance of avoiding idol worship. Although the student provided additional information beyond the specific concern, their response was thorough, well-explained, and aligned with a Christian worldview."
