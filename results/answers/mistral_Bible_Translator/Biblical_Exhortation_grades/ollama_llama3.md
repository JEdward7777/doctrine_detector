## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the New Testament, Jesus gave his apostles a directive regarding the "good news" (Gospel) in Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV):

19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

Here, Jesus commands his apostles to go out and make disciples (teach people to follow him) among all nations (people groups), baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he has commanded. He also assures them that he will always be with them, to the end of the age. This is commonly known as the Great Commission, which underscores the Christian responsibility for evangelism and discipleship.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 70.

The response does mention Jesus' directive to spread the good news, which shows some recognition of the importance of evangelism in Christianity. However, it falls short of fully capturing the essence and scope of the Great Commission. The response only mentions "how to be part of God's kingdom through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin," which is a crucial aspect of the Gospel, but it does not capture the breadth of the commission, including baptizing and teaching obedience to Christ's commands.

To improve this response, it would be helpful to provide more detail about what "spreading the good news" entails, such as making disciples among all nations, teaching them to obey everything Jesus has commanded, and emphasizing the importance of evangelism in proclaiming the Gospel.
