## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the New Testament, Jesus gave his apostles a directive regarding the "good news" (Gospel) in Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV):

19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

Here, Jesus commands his apostles to go out and make disciples (teach people to follow him) among all nations (people groups), baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything he has commanded. He also assures them that he will always be with them, to the end of the age. This is commonly known as the Great Commission, which underscores the Christian responsibility for evangelism and discipleship.
