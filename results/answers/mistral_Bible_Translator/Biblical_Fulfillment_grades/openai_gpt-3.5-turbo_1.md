## [Answer](../Biblical_Fulfillment.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the Bible, found primarily in the Gospel accounts (Matthew 2:2; John 19:14, 19-21), indeed have significant connections with Old Testament prophecies.

The title "King of the Jews" is a fulfilment of several prophecies from the Hebrew Scriptures, or Old Testament. For instance, Isaiah 9:6-7 prophesies about a future descendant of David who will be called "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." In addition, this figure is also referred to as the "King of Israel" (Isaiah 11:10).

Another significant prophecy can be found in 2 Samuel 7:12-13, where God promises David that one of his descendants will establish his kingdom forever. This eternal king would have an everlasting dynasty and his kingdom would be established and maintained by the Lord Himself (2 Samuel 7:16).

In Zechariah 9:9, we find a prophecy about a future king who comes to Jerusalem riding on a donkey and is praised as righteous and victorious. The Gospels show us that Jesus enters Jerusalem for the last time riding on a donkey (Matthew 21:5), fulfilling this specific prophecy.

These Old Testament prophecies point to a coming Messiah who would be a king, establish an everlasting kingdom, and bring peace. The references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the New Testament highlight that He is the fulfilment of these ancient promises and prophecies.

It demonstrates a clear understanding of how Jesus fulfills these prophecies and emphasizes the importance of recognizing biblical prophecy for Christian theology.
