  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'hope' in a biblical context, emphasizing trust, faith, and reliance on God's promises. They referenced relevant biblical verses from both the Old and New Testament to support their points. However, the student's response could have been improved by placing more emphasis on the aspect of desire and sure expectation in the definition of hope, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
