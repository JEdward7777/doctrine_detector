## [Answer](../Biblical_Hope_Definition.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a biblical context, "hope" (often represented by the Greek word "elpis" or the Hebrew words "besed," "tsedaqah," and "yachas") signifies a confident expectation for God's promises to be fulfilled. It is more than mere wishful thinking; it involves trust, faith, and reliance on God, especially in difficult circumstances. Biblical hope is grounded in the character, goodness, and faithfulness of God as demonstrated through His actions and promises.

In the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 13:13 highlights that "faith, hope, and love" are essential virtues, with hope being a key aspect of Christian life as it is described as the expectation of eternal life in Jesus Christ. Romans 5:20-21 speaks about the law coming in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, just as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

In the Old Testament, Jeremiah 17:7-8 explains that blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD and whose hope is in Him. For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river, and will not fear when heat comes; but its leaf will be green, and will not be anxious in the year of drought, nor will cease from yielding fruit.

Thus, hope in the biblical sense is a firm assurance and confident expectation grounded in faith that God's promises, love, and grace are real, active, and trustworthy, bringing life, joy, and fruitfulness to those who place their hope in Him.
