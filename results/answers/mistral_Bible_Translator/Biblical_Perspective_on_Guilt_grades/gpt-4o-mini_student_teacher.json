  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 80.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of examples from the Bible illustrating the consequences of guilt and sin, they missed focusing on the severity and gravity of sin in relation to God's grace and mercy. The answer primarily presents the consequences of sin without emphasizing the deep and profound impact sin has on our relationship with God and the need for His grace. Although the student did touch on redemption through faith in Jesus Christ, they could have further emphasized the need for repentance and the recognition of our own sinfulness in order to fully appreciate God's grace and mercy as outlined in the reference answer."
