  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a strong selection of Bible verses that effectively illustrate the concept of God's majesty as the creator of the universe and emphasized His unmatched power and wisdom. However, the student missed some key verses mentioned in the reference answer from the teacher that could have further enriched their response. They demonstrated a good understanding of connecting scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature but could improve by incorporating a broader range of verses."
