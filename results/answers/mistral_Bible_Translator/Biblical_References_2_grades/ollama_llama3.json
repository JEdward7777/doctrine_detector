These verses effectively convey God's power, wisdom, and unmatched nature as the Creator of the universe. However, the provided answer references different passages (2 Peter 1:16-18, Daniel 4:36, Isaiah 2:10, Jude 1:25, and Micah 5:4) that do not directly illustrate God's majesty as the creator of the universe. While these verses may indirectly suggest God's majesty, they do not explicitly convey it like the provided references do.\n\nTo improve this response, consider providing biblical references that more directly illustrate God's majestic nature as the Creator of the universe."
