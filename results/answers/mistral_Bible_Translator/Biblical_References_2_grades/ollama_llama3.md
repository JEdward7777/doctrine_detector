## [Answer](../Biblical_References_2.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1. Psalm 96:4-5 (NIV) - "For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens."

2. Isaiah 40:25-26 (NIV) - "To whom will you compare me or make me equal? To whom will you liken me?... Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name, because of his great power and strength, not one is missing."

3. Job 38:4-7 (NIV) - "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand. Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it? On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?"

4. Revelation 4:11 (NIV) - "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."

These verses illustrate the concept of God's majesty as the creator of the universe, one who is beyond comparison, and one whose power and wisdom are unmatched.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides several biblical references that illustrate God's majesty, including Psalm 96, Isaiah 40, Job 38, and Revelation 4. These verses effectively convey God's power, wisdom, and unmatched nature as the Creator of the universe. However, the provided answer references different passages (2 Peter 1:16-18, Daniel 4:36, Isaiah 2:10, Jude 1:25, and Micah 5:4) that do not directly illustrate God's majesty as the creator of the universe. While these verses may indirectly suggest God's majesty, they do not explicitly convey it like the provided references do.

To improve this response, consider providing biblical references that more directly illustrate God's majestic nature as the Creator of the universe.
