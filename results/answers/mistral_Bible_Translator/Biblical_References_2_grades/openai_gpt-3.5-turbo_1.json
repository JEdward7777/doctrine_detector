However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the given verses (Psalm 96:4-5, Isaiah 40:25-26, Job 38:4-7, Revelation 4:11) in relation to the concept of God's majesty as the creator of the universe. Explicitly connecting the verses provided in the response with the verses in the original text would strengthen the answer and deepen the understanding of God's majestic nature."
