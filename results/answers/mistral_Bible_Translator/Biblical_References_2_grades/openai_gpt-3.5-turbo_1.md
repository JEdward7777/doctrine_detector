1. Psalm 96:4-5 (NIV) - "For great is the Lord and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens."

2. Isaiah 40:25-26 (NIV) - "To whom will you compare me or make me equal? To whom will you liken me?... Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name, because of his great power and strength, not one is missing."

3. Job 38:4-7 (NIV) - "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand. Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it? On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?"

4. Revelation 4:11 (NIV) - "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."

These verses illustrate the concept of God's majesty as the creator of the universe, one who is beyond comparison, and one whose power and wisdom are unmatched.

Comment: The response provides a solid foundation by referencing relevant Bible verses that highlight God's majesty and power. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the given verses (Psalm 96:4-5, Isaiah 40:25-26, Job 38:4-7, Revelation 4:11) in relation to the concept of God's majesty as the creator of the universe. Explicitly connecting the verses provided in the response with the verses in the original text would strengthen the answer and deepen the understanding of God's majestic nature.
