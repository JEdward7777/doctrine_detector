  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides appropriate Bible references that emphasize God's majesty, but it lacks a detailed explanation connecting these scriptures with the understanding of God's majestic nature. To improve, the response could delve deeper into how these verses illustrate the concept of God's majesty as the creator of the universe and how they highlight His unmatched power and wisdom. Overall, a good effort but more elaboration is needed."
