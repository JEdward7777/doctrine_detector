The student effectively connects the prophetic visions in Daniel, the symbolism in Ezekiel, the concept of dominion in Psalm 8, and attributes of the Messiah in Isaiah 9. However, the analysis could be strengthened by emphasizing the unique significance of each passage in relation to the title \"Son of Man\" and its messianic implications within the broader context of Old Testament prophecy. Additionally, a more explicit integration of how these references specifically point to Jesus as the fulfillment of messianic expectations would enhance the depth of the explanation."
