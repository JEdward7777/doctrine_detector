While the answer showcases a good grasp of relevant passages and their implications, it could have been strengthened by focusing more on key references like Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel that specifically address the 'Son of Man' in relation to the messianic role. Additionally, the student effectively connects these Old Testament references to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Messiah."
