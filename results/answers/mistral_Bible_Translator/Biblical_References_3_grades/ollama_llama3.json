The provided examples from Daniel, Ezekiel, and Psalm are relevant and well-connected to the concern. However, the response could be improved by providing more analysis and explanation of how these Old Testament references inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\".\n\nThe provided answer is a good start, but it could be more detailed and nuanced in its connection between the Old Testament references and the New Testament understanding. For example, it would be helpful to explore how Daniel 7:14's depiction of the Son of Man coming with the clouds relates to Jesus' baptism or his ascension into heaven, which are key events in the New Testament that highlight his messianic role as the \"Son of Man\". Additionally, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into Ezekiel's use of the title \"son of man\" and how it reflects Jesus' prophetic identity as the Messiah.\n\nOverall, while the response is a good start, it could benefit from more analysis and explanation to fully demonstrate how the Old Testament references inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man\"."
