It effectively highlights the connections between the title \"Son of Man\" in Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel as well as the prophetic identity linked to this title. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a good grasp of the topic. However, there could be further elaboration on how these Old Testament references specifically shape the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the \"Son of Man\" to enhance the depth of the analysis."
