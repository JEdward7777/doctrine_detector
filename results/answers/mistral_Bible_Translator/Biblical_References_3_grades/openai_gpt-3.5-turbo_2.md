## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The concept of the "Son of Man" in the Old Testament lays a significant foundation for understanding Jesus as the coming Messiah in the New Testament. Here are some key Old Testament references that contribute to this understanding:

1. Daniel 7:13-14: In the Book of Daniel, chapter 7, there is a prophetic vision about the Son of Man who comes with the clouds of heaven and receives dominion, glory, and a kingdom. This passage is often seen as a messianic prophecy and is one of the most influential Old Testament passages for Jewish expectations of the Messiah.

2. Daniel 10:5-6: In this passage, an angel identifies himself as "a man, Gabriel," but also states that he has come to Daniel with God's name, "the great Son of Man." This suggests a heavenly figure who serves as a messenger from God and possibly hints at the coming Messiah.

3. Ezekiel 2:1-3: In Ezekiel's call narrative, God tells the prophet that He has made him a watchman for the house of Israel and sends him to speak to "men" (literally, "sons of men") and to bind up the broken hearted, lead the captives out, and declare my holy laws. Ezekiel is given the title "son of man," which likely implies his role as a representative of humanity, including the Messiah.

4. Psalm 8:4-6: This psalm speaks about God's creation of mankind and gives them dominion over the works of His hands, putting all things under their feet, including the angels. While not explicitly referring to a future messianic figure, it foreshadows the role of the Messiah as the one who will rule over the earth and exercise divine authority.

5. Isaiah 9:6: Although not using the exact phrase "Son of Man," this passage describes the coming Messiah as a prince of peace, mighty God, eternal Father, and Wonderful Counselor. These attributes suggest a figure who reigns in both humanity and divinity—echoing the concept of the Son of Man.

Comment: The response provides a concise overview of key Old Testament references, Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel's title as "son of man," connecting them to Jesus' messianic role. However, it could have further elaborated on the significance of other Old Testament passages such as Daniel 10, Psalm 8, and Isaiah 9 to offer a more comprehensive understanding of how the Old Testament informs the New Testament's portrayal of Jesus as the 'Son of Man.'
