  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise overview of key Old Testament references relating to the concept of the \"Son of Man\" and its connection to the Messiah in the New Testament. The examples from Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel effectively demonstrate the prophetic identity of the Son of Man. However, the response could have been strengthened by providing a more detailed analysis of additional Old Testament passages to further explore the depth of the concept's influence on understanding Jesus as the 'Son of Man'. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and effectively addresses the concern presented."
