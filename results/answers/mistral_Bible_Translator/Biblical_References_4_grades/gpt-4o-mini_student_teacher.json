  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90. The student provided a comprehensive selection of biblical passages from both the Old and New Testaments that illustrate the use of \"Lord\" in the context of God. The passages are relevant and demonstrate an understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord. Though the student did not include the specific references mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher, their response is still accurate and effectively reinforces the concept of God's lordship."
