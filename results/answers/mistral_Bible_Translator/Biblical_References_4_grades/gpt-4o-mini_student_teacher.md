## Question [Biblical References 4](../../../questions/Biblical_References_4.md)
Can you give examples of biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God?

## Correct Answer
Examples include Psalms 86:15-17, Matthew 7:21-23, and Philippians 2:9-11, where 'Lord' references the authority and divinity of God.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing biblical references helps reinforce the understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord.

## [Answer](../Biblical_References_4.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Absolutely! The Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) frequently uses the term "Adonai" (הַ֫דֹּודָי, Had-doday), which is often translated as "Lord" in English versions of the Bible. Here are a few examples:

1. Genesis 2:4 - "These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens."

2. Exodus 3:15 - "God also said to Moses, 'Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: 'The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,' has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations.'"

3. Deuteronomy 6:4 - "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one!"

In the New Testament (Greek Bible), the term "Kyrios" (Κύριος) is often used for God and translated as "Lord." Here are a few examples:

1. Matthew 28:19 - "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

2. John 1:1 - "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

3. Acts 20:28 - "Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood."

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's answer a 90. The student provided a comprehensive selection of biblical passages from both the Old and New Testaments that illustrate the use of "Lord" in the context of God. The passages are relevant and demonstrate an understanding of God's authority and the importance of acknowledging Him as Lord. Though the student did not include the specific references mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher, their response is still accurate and effectively reinforces the concept of God's lordship.
