  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and insightful response that effectively demonstrates an understanding of the significance of \"Lord\" in the biblical context. The student provides clear examples from both the Old and New Testaments, thoughtfully explaining the translation and theological implications of the term. However, including the suggested reference answers would have strengthened the response and aligned it more closely with the given concern."
