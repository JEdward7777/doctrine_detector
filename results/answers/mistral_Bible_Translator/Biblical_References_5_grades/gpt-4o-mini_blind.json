The student effectively links the Passover meal, the Eucharist/Communion, and the symbolic significance of unleavened bread in Christian worship. Additionally, the inclusion of Paul's teaching on purity in connection to unleavened bread demonstrates an understanding of the theological implications. Well done!"
