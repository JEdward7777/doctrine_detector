  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85. \n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation of how unleavened bread is connected to Christian teachings through the Last Supper and Paul's letter to the Corinthians, demonstrating a clear understanding of the significance of unleavened bread in Christian practices. However, the student's answer included additional details beyond the specific biblical text referenced in the concern, which could have been more focused on identifying and discussing the relevant biblical text, 1 Corinthians 5:6-8.\n\nOverall, the student's response shows a solid understanding of the topic with well-supported explanations."
