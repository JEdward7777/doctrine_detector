  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 90/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is well-researched and clearly explains the connection between the concept of unleavened bread and Christian teachings. It provides specific references to relevant New Testament passages and connects the practice of Communion to the symbolism of unleavened bread. The student also draws a connection between the concept of unleavened bread and Christian purity, citing Paul's letter to the Corinthians. The reference to the teacher's answer is also appropriate."
