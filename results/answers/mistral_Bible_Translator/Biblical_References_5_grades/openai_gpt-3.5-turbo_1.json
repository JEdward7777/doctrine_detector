  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively identifies relevant biblical texts, specifically referencing 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, that provide insight into Christian practices related to unleavened bread. It also explains the significance of unleavened bread in the context of purity and living a sin-free life as emphasized by Paul. The integration of biblical references and theological interpretation is well-done."
