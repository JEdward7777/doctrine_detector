## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The concept of unleavened bread is most notably connected to Christian teachings through the Last Supper account in the New Testament, specifically in the books of Matthew (26:17-30), Mark (14:12-26), Luke (22:7-23), and Paul's letter to the Corinthians (1 Corinthians 5:7-8).

In these passages, Jesus and his disciples are eating the Passover meal, which includes unleavened bread. Jesus instructs his disciples to remember him through this bread and wine in what is now known as the Eucharist or Communion. This practice became an important part of Christian worship and symbolizes the body and blood of Christ, respectively.

Moreover, in 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, Paul makes a connection between unleavened bread and the purity that Christians should strive for: "For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened by malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth." Here, Paul emphasizes that as followers of Christ, believers should live a life free from sin (represented by leaven or yeast) and should strive for purity and truth.
