  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses that indeed offer insight into the concept of resurrection within Christianity. However, the student missed including some key verses mentioned in the teacher's answer, which could have further enriched their response. Additionally, the student's explanation of the significance of the doctrine of resurrection could have been more detailed to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic. Overall, a solid effort but room for improvement in incorporating a wider range of verses and providing more depth in analysis."
