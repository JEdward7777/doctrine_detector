  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good selection of Bible verses that support the concept of resurrection and eternal life, including John 5:28-29 which specifically highlights the physical resurrection of believers. However, the response could have benefited from more detailed analysis and explanation of how these verses relate to the Christian doctrine of resurrection. Nevertheless, the emphasis on scriptural grounding is commendable, as it meets the concern specified.\n\nThe grade is not higher because:\n\n* The response does not delve deeper into the significance of each verse or provide specific examples of how they contribute to our understanding of resurrection and eternal life.\n* There is no explicit connection made between the verses provided and the original answer, which could have strengthened the response."
