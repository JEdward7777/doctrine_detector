1. John 5:28-29 (NIV) - "Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come outâ€”those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned."

2. 1 Corinthians 15:12-23 (NIV) - "But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied."

3. Acts 24:15 (NIV) - "I have a conscience clear before God and men because I can face my own conscience, and I have great confidence in the Lord that I myself am neither unskilled nor ashamed in the things I teach."

These verses provide insight into the Christian concept of resurrection, emphasizing the belief in the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ and the future resurrection of all believers. They also highlight the significance of this doctrine in the Christian faith.
