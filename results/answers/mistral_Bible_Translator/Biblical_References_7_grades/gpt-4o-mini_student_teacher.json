  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer with multiple relevant Bible references highlighting the significance of the Sabbath in the Christian faith. The references provided effectively demonstrate the importance of the Sabbath as a part of God's covenant, a day of rest and worship, and its extension to both the Israelites and foreigners. While the teacher's reference answer included additional specific verses, the student's response still effectively addresses the concern and showcases a strong understanding of the topic. Great job!"
