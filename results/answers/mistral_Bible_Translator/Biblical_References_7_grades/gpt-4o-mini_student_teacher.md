1. Exodus 20:8-11 (The Ten Commandments): "Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."

2. Deuteronomy 5:12-15 (The Ten Commandments repeated): "Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day."

3. Nehemiah 9:14 (Prayer of Repentance): "You did not make a covenant with us based on our deeds, since we were slaves who had escaped from the land of Egypt. You laid these things before us, so that we would fear you and keep all your commands and do them." This passage acknowledges that God gave the Sabbath as part of the covenant when Israel was delivered from slavery in Egypt.

4. Isaiah 56:1-8 (God's promise to foreigners): "This is what the Lord says: 'Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed. Blessed is the man who does this, the man who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.' Let no foreigner who has bound himself to the Lord say, 'The Lord will surely exclude me from his people.' And let no eunuch complain, 'I am only a dry tree.' For this is what the Lord says: 'To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant—to them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will endure forever. And foreigners who bind themselves to the Lord to serve him, to love the name of the Lord, and to worship him, all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant—these I will bring to my holy mountain and give them joy in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations.' The Sovereign Lord declares—he who gathers the exiles of Israel: 'I will gather still others to them besides those already gathered.'" This passage shows that even foreigners were included in keeping the Sabbath.

5. Luke 4:16-30 (Jesus' sermon in Nazareth): "He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. And he stood up to read. The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: 'The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.' He rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. Then he began to speak to them, 'Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.'" Jesus emphasized the significance of Sabbath by fulfilling its purpose during his ministry.

These passages highlight the importance of the Sabbath as a part of God's covenant with Israel, as a reminder of God's deliverance from Egypt, and as a day set apart for rest, worship, and fellowship. They also show that the Sabbath was not exclusive to the people of Israel but extended to foreigners who chose to follow God and keep His commands.
