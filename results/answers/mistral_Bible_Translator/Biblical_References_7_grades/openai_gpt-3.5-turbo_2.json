The inclusion of Old Testament, New Testament, and Jesus' teachings on the Sabbath, along with an emphasis on its significance in God's covenant with Israel and inclusion of foreigners, demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the scriptural backing for the Sabbath observance and its relevance in Christian faith. Well done!"
