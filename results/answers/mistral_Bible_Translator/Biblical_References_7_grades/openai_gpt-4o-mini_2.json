The inclusion of specific references such as Exodus 20, Deuteronomy 5, Nehemiah 9, Isaiah 56, and Luke 4, along with a clear explanation of the Sabbath's significance based on these texts, aligns well with the concern provided. The additional reference to Exodus 31 and Mark 2 further strengthens the argument. Overall, it effectively demonstrates the scriptural backing for Sabbath observance and its relevance in the Christian faith. Great work!"
