  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of ransom in Christian theology and referenced relevant verses to support their points. However, the student missed out on some key verses like Isaiah 43:3 that were highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Encouraging the student to incorporate a wider range of verses to deepen their exploration of the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption."
