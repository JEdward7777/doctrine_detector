The inclusion of key Bible verses, along with explanations, demonstrates a solid understanding of how the theme of deliverance and God's initiative in redeeming His people is supported by scripture. The response effectively connects the concept of ransom in Atonement Theory to the broader theme of redemption in Christian theology."
