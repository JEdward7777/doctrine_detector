 In Christian theology, the concept of ransom plays a significant role in the understanding of redemption, particularly within the context of Atonement Theory. The idea is that Jesus Christ paid a ransom to free humanity from sin and its consequences. Here are some Bible verses that reference this concept:

1. Matthew 20:28 (NIV): "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." This verse highlights Jesus's mission to save humanity by giving His life as a ransom.

2. Mark 10:45 (NIV): "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." This verse reiterates Jesus's mission as a ransom for many.

3. Matthew 26:28 (NIV): "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." While not explicitly using the term 'ransom', this verse ties Jesus's sacrifice to redemption and forgiveness of sins.

4. 1 Timothy 2:5-6 (NIV): "For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all menâ€”the testimony given in its proper time." This verse emphasizes Jesus as the ransom for all, serving as a mediator between God and humanity.

These verses contribute to the understanding of redemption by explaining that Jesus paid a ransom (sacrificed Himself) to free humanity from sin and reconcile them with God. The ransom concept illustrates that Jesus purchased our salvation through His death, offering us redemption as a gift.
