  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of covenant faithfulness in the Bible. The student effectively referenced key verses from both the Old and New Testaments that highlight God's faithfulness to His covenants with His people. The explanation provided is clear and supported by relevant scripture passages. The only area for improvement would be to include a more explicit connection between the concept of covenant faithfulness and its implications for believers today."
