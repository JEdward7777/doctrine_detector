  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation with relevant Bible verses illustrating covenant faithfulness. However, the student missed the specific references indicated in the teacher's answer, Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18. Encouraging the student to pay closer attention to the specific verses related to the concept of covenant faithfulness in future responses would improve their understanding and application of scriptural examples."
