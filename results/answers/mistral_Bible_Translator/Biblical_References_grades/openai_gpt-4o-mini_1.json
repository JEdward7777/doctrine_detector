  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the provided scriptural examples to the understanding of covenant faithfulness by explaining how each verse highlights God's faithfulness in keeping His promises to His people. The explanation is clear and aligns well with a Christian worldview. The response could have been strengthened by adding some analysis or reflection on the significance of covenant faithfulness in the context of the relationship between God and His people, but overall a solid understanding is demonstrated."
