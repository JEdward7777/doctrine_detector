  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a thorough analysis of the passages and effectively highlights the inclusion of Gentiles in the early Christian community. The student accurately explains the context and meaning of Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion; however, it could have been strengthened by directly addressing how faith in Jesus, rather than adherence to the law, justifies Gentiles before God, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
