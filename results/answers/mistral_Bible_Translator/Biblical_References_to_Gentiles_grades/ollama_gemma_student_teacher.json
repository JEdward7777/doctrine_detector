The student clearly explains the significance of Acts 9:13-16 in relation to God's plan for salvation extending beyond ethnic boundaries, and the relevance of Galatians 2:16 in addressing the issue of legalistic separation between Jews and Gentiles. The response is well-written and demonstrates thoughtful analysis of the texts."
