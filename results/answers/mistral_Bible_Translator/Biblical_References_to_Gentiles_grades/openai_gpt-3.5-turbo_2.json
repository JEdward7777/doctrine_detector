  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a well-analyzed breakdown of the passages in Acts 9:13-16 and Galatians 2:16, highlighting the inclusion of Gentiles in the early Christian community. The student effectively connects the apostolic mission to the Gentiles with the importance of faith in Jesus for justification, aligning with the concern on exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion. Additionally, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on salvation for all. Great job!"
