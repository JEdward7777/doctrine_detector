  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of key verses related to heaven as a prepared place for believers, a new heaven and earth where God dwells with His people, and the promise of eternal life for those who have faith in Christ. The verses cited align well with the concern of exploring references to enhance our understanding of God's kingdom and the physical and spiritual realities of heaven. The integration of these verses with the student's response would further enrich the explanation of heaven within a Christian worldview."
