1. John 14:2-3 (NIV): "In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am."
   This verse emphasizes the idea of heaven as a place prepared by God for those who believe in Him. Jesus refers to it as His Father's house, suggesting a familial relationship between God, Christ, and believers.

2. Revelation 21:1-4 (NIV): "Then I saw ‘a new heaven and a new earth,' for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‘Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.'"
   This passage in Revelation describes a new heaven and new earth, suggesting that heaven is not an ethereal, disembodied existence but rather a physical place where God dwells among His people. There will be no more sorrow, death, or pain, reflecting the perfection and completeness of heaven.

3. 2 Corinthians 5:1 (NIV): "For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands."
   This verse emphasizes the idea of heaven as an eternal dwelling place for believers, contrasting it with our temporary earthly bodies. It suggests that believers will be given new, eternal bodies when they enter heaven.

4. Luke 23:43 (NIV): "And he said to him, ‘Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.'"
   This verse shows Jesus promising a place in paradise, often understood as representing a part of heaven, to the repentant criminal who was crucified alongside Him. It underscores the idea that even those who are unworthy by human standards can enter heaven through faith in Christ.

5. Matthew 25:34 (NIV): "Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.'"
   This verse emphasizes the idea of heaven as a place where believers inherit eternal life and rule with Christ, an inheritance that has been prepared since before the creation of the world. It suggests that heaven is not just a destination but also a reward for faithfulness to God.
