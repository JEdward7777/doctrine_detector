  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost by identifying key verses in Leviticus, Exodus, and Numbers that reference the Festival of Weeks. The inclusion of Acts 2:1 from the New Testament further illustrates the continuity and fulfillment of this Old Testament festival in the events of Pentecost. However, the teacher's reference answer includes additional books where references to the Festival of Weeks can be found, indicating a more comprehensive understanding."
