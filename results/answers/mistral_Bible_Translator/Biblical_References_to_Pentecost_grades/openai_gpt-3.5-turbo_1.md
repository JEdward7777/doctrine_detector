## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Festival of Weeks, also known as Pentecost, appears in three books of the Old Testament (or Hebrew Bible): Leviticus, Exodus, and Numbers. Here are some key verses that reference this festival:

1. Leviticus 23:15-22: This passage gives detailed instructions about how to observe the Festival of Weeks. It specifies that it is to be celebrated seven weeks (forty-nine days) after the offering of the wave sheaf (or Firstfruits), on the fiftieth day.

   Leviticus 23:16 says, "Count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the LORD."

2. Exodus 34:22: This verse mentions the Festival of Weeks as one of the three annual pilgrimage festivals where all Israelite males were required to appear before the Lord in the sanctuary.

   Exodus 34:22 says, "Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival to me."

3. Numbers 28:26-31: This passage describes the offerings to be presented on the Festival of Weeks and highlights the significance of this day. It mentions a special grain offering and burnt offerings, in addition to the regular daily and Sabbath sacrifices.

   Numbers 28:26 says, "Present a one-month-old male lamb without defect as a burnt offering, along with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil, and its drink offering of four liters of wine."

In the New Testament (Acts 2:1), we find the account of the first celebration of Pentecost following Jesus' resurrection, where the Holy Spirit was poured out on the disciples. This event marks a significant transition in God's relationship with humanity and is often interpreted as the inauguration of the Church.

Comment: The response provided accurate information about the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) as referenced in Leviticus, Exodus, and Numbers, as well as the New Testament account in Acts. However, the answer given by the student regarding additional references to Pentecost in 2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, and Acts is incorrect. This misrepresentation shows a lack of understanding of the specific biblical texts related to the observance and significance of Pentecost, resulting in a lower grade.
