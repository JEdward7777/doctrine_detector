However, the response mistakenly stated that references to the festival can be found in 2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, and Acts, which is incorrect. The accurate references were Leviticus, Exodus, and Numbers. Additionally, the New Testament reference given in Acts 2:1 was about the celebration of Pentecost, not the Festival of Weeks, which could lead to confusion. It is important to correctly identify the biblical sources to grasp the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost within a Christian worldview."
