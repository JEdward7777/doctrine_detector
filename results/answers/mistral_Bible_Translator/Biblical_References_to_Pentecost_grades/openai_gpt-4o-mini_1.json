  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed and accurate overview of the Festival of Weeks/Pentecost based on the Old Testament references in Leviticus, Exodus, and Numbers. However, the claim made in the given answer that references to the Festival of Weeks can be found in 2 Chronicles, Deuteronomy, Numbers, and Acts is incorrect and not supported by the scriptural information provided in the response. Therefore, the grade is lowered for inaccurately stating the sources of references to the Festival of Weeks."
