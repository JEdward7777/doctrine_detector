  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student effectively analyzes the passages from 1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20 and provides a thorough explanation of Christ's role as Savior based on those verses. The student successfully connects the sanctifying work of Christ with the concept of salvation, highlighting important aspects of Christ's nature as Savior. However, the student's answer could be improved by explicitly tying in the idea of salvation being foundational to the Christian faith, as mentioned in the reference answer. Strengthening this connection would enhance the overall coherence and depth of the student's analysis."
