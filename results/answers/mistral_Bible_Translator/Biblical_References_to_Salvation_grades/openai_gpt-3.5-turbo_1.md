# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1 Timothy 4:10 and 2 Peter 2:20, while not explicitly describing the nature of Christ as Savior, do provide insights into aspects of His role as a Savior within Christian theology.

In 1 Timothy 4:10, we read, "For to this end we have been sanctified: that we should be for the praise of Him who called us out of darkness into His marvelous light." This verse underscores the salvific work of Christ by revealing that our sanctification, or setting apart for a holy purpose, is for the praise and glory of God. This implies that Jesus Christ, as our Savior, sanctifies us and calls us from spiritual darkness into the light of faith, so that we may glorify Him.

2 Peter 2:20 speaks about false teachers who have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, but then again entangle themselves in these things and are defeated. It says, "For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first."

This passage highlights that those who profess faith in Christ as their Savior can choose to disregard His teachings and return to sinful ways. However, it also emphasizes that the consequences of such actions are severe, suggesting a deep commitment and responsibility on the part of Christians to remain faithful to their Savior. This underscores the importance of Christ's role as our Savior who calls us out of darkness into His light and requires us to remain faithful in return.

In summary, these passages highlight the sanctifying work of Christ as our Savior and emphasize the importance of remaining faithful to Him after professing faith.
