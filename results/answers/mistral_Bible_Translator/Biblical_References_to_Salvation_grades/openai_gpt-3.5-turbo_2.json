The explanation of how Christ sanctifies believers and calls them out of darkness into light, as well as the warning against falling back into sin in 2 Peter 2:20, demonstrates a solid understanding of Christ's role as Savior based on these passages. The response could be enhanced by connecting these insights to the broader theological implications of salvation in Christian belief."
