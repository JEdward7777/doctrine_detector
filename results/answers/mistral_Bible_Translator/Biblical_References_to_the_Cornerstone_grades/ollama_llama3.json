  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response earns points for:\n\n* Providing specific Bible verses that highlight Jesus' significance as the cornerstone, including Acts 4:11, Ephesians 2:20, Matthew 21:42, and Psalms 118:22.\n* Offering brief explanations of the significance of each verse, helping to deepen understanding of Jesus' role in faith and salvation.\n\nHowever, this response falls short of a perfect score due to:\n\n* Not fully exploring the depth of scripture, as the concern suggests. While the response provides some explanations, it could benefit from more in-depth analysis and reflection on what these verses mean for believers.\n* Failing to explicitly connect Jesus' role as cornerstone to his significance in their faith, leaving room for further exploration and encouragement.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of Jesus' importance as the cornerstone and provides relevant scripture examples. However, it could benefit from further development and connection-making to fully encourage believers to explore scripture and deepen their understanding of Jesus' significance."
