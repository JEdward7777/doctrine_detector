  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough exploration of several Bible verses that highlight Jesus as the cornerstone, including explanations of their significance and connections to Jesus as the Messiah. The answer effectively deepens the understanding of Jesus' significance in the foundation of faith and the Church, aligning well with the concern provided. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a broader range of verses, beyond those explicitly mentioned in the original answer, to further enrich the exploration of Jesus as the cornerstone in Scripture."
