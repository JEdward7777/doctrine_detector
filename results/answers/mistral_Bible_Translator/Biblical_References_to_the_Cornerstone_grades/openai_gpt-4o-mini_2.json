The explanation not only lists the verses but also provides brief interpretations and significance. While the response could have benefited from more in-depth analysis and personal reflection on the significance of Jesus as the cornerstone, it effectively encourages believers to explore scripture and deepens their understanding of Jesus' significance in their faith."
