## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Cornerstone.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 There are several Bible verses that refer to Jesus as the cornerstone. Here are some of them and a brief explanation of their significance:

1. Isaiah 28:16 (NIV): "So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: 'See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic." This prophecy in Isaiah speaks of Jesus as the future Messiah and Savior.

2. Psalm 118:22 (NIV): "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone." This psalm was a popular one during Jesus' time, and Jesus himself quotes it in Matthew 21:42-43 to explain his mission as Messiah.

3. Daniel 2:34-35 (NIV): "You [King Nebuchadnezzar] were looking, O king, and there before you stood a large statueâ€”an enormous, shining bronze figure, awesome and terrifying. The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms also were of gold, its belly and thighs of silver, its legs of bronze, its feet of iron, as furnace-baked clay." Daniel interprets the dream for Nebuchadnezzar and reveals that a stone (Jesus) will be cut without hands, which will strike the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smash them. The stone then becomes a great mountain that fills the whole earth.

4. Matthew 21:42-46 (NIV): Jesus quotes Psalm 118:22 in this passage, explaining that though the builders rejected him, he is now the cornerstone, and whoever falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but whoever it falls on will be crushed.

5. Ephesians 2:19-20 (NIV): "Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with God's people and also members of his household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone." In this passage, the Apostle Paul explains that believers in Christ are part of a spiritual building with Jesus as the cornerstone.

These verses convey that Jesus is the foundation upon which our faith and salvation rest. He is the essential, indispensable stone upon which everything else depends.
