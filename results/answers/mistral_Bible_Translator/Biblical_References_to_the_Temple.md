## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The term "House of Yahweh" (or its equivalent in Hebrew, "Bethel" or "Beth-el," meaning "House of God") is used frequently in the Old Testament to refer to the temple or sacred place where Yahweh was worshipped. Here are some key scriptures that reference the temple as the House of Yahweh:

1. Genesis 28:16-19: In this passage, Jacob dreams of a stairway reaching to heaven with angels ascending and descending upon it, and he declares, "This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."

2. Exodus 25:8: God commands Moses to have the Israelites construct the sanctuary (the Tabernacle), saying, "Let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them."

3. 1 Kings 6:12-13: Solomon prays for wisdom to rule God's people and says, "I have built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell forever."

4. Ezekiel 43:1-12: In this vision, Ezekiel sees the glory of the Lord return to the temple, which is referred to as the House of Yahweh.

5. Haggai 2:7-9: The prophet Haggai encourages the people to rebuild the Temple and promises that it will be greater than Solomon's Temple because God is with them. He says, "On this day I am declaring that I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea and the dry land."

6. Malachi 3:1: The prophet Malachi says, "I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the Messenger of the Covenant, whom you desire, will come, 'saying,' I will reclaim and rebuild my exalted dwelling place, and I will come and dwell among you.'"

These scriptures highlight the importance of the temple as a sacred space for worshipping Yahweh. It serves as a physical manifestation of God's presence among his people.
