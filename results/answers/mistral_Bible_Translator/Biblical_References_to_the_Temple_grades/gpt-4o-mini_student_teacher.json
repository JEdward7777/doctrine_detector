  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation and identified several key scriptures that discuss the temple as the House of Yahweh. However, the specific scriptures referenced by the teacher were not included in the student's response, which would have strengthened the answer. Additionally, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept from a Christian worldview."
