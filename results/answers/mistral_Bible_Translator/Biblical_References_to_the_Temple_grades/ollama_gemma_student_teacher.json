  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer is thorough and insightful, providing detailed references from the Old Testament to support their claims. They accurately identify key scriptures that discuss the temple as the \"House of Yahweh\" and explain its significance as a physical manifestation of God's presence. \n\nHowever, the reference answer provided by the teacher includes additional verses that the student did not mention. Including these additional references would have strengthened the student's answer and earned them a slightly higher grade."
