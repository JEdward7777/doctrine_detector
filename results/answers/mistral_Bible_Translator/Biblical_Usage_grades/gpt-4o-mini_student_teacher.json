They also correctly noted that while the term generally indicates direct descent, there are instances where the genealogies may not be strictly linear. The student effectively addressed the concern of understanding the importance of genealogies in establishing Jesus' lineage and fulfilling prophecies. The answer could be improved by directly stating that \"begat\" showcases paternal connections through generations, aligning more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
