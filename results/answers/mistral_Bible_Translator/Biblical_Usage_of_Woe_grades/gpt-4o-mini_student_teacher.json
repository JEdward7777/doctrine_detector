  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful analysis of the term \"woe\" in the Bible and its significance in conveying God's judgment. The student correctly identifies various examples and effectively demonstrates how the term is used in prophetic and narrative contexts to emphasize impending judgment. However, the student's answer could be improved by including additional examples, such as the ones provided in the reference answer, to cover a broader range of biblical instances where \"woe\" is used. Overall, a strong effort with room for slight improvement."
