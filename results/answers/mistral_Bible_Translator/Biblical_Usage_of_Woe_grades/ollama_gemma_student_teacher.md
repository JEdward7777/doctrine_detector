 In the Bible, the term "woe" (Hebrew: אוֹי, oy; Greek: οὐαι, ouaı) is often used by prophets to express strong disapproval or foretell impending judgement and punishment from God. Here are a few examples:

1. In the Old Testament (OT), Isaiah 5:8-23, often called "The Song of the Vineyard," uses the term "woe" four times. This passage describes how Israel was like a vineyard that God had planted and tended but that has produced wild grapes instead of good fruit. The woe pronouncements indicate God's disappointment and impending judgment.

2. In Jeremiah 4:19-31, the prophet speaks of Jerusalem, personified as a desolate woman, and says, "I will make their officials and their nobles wail, and the leaders and all the people will be transported with bitterness." Here, "woe" signifies God's judgment on Jerusalem for its unfaithfulness.

3. In Matthew 11:20-24, Jesus uses the term twice in what is known as the "Woes to the Cities of Galilee." He pronounces woe upon Chorazin and Bethsaida because they saw the miracles of John the Baptist and Jesus but still did not repent. Woe was also pronounced on Capernaum, a city that had seen many miracles performed by Jesus.

4. In Revelation 8:13, the seventh angel sounds his trumpet, and there are great earthquakes, hail, and fire mixed with blood. John sees a star falling from heaven, saying "Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound!" Here, "woe" signifies impending judgment and sorrow for all people on earth.

These examples reveal that God's judgement is a consequence of disobedience or rejection of His will. The term "woe" serves as a solemn warning and call to repentance, emphasizing the gravity of spiritual rebellion against God.
