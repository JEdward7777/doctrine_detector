  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive examination of the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture, focusing on the term \"woe\" as a symbol of strong disapproval and impending judgment from God. The inclusion of specific examples from the Old Testament, New Testament, and Revelation, along with explanations of their contexts, effectively illustrates the gravity of spiritual rebellion against God. The response effectively addresses the concern raised and demonstrates a clear understanding of the Christian worldview on divine judgment."
