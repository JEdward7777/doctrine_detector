  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and detailed examination of the figurative ways in which the term 'Zion' is used in the Bible. The student effectively connects the concept of Zion to various theological themes such as the City of David, the Mountain of God, salvation, the Church, God's eternal dwelling place, righteousness, joy, and peace. The response is well-supported with relevant biblical references and demonstrates a solid understanding of the significance of Zion in Christian theology. Great job overall!"
