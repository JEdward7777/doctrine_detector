  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive and well-structured response that covers various figurative ways 'Zion' is used in the Bible, touching on its significance in relation to physical locations, spiritual concepts, salvation, and eschatological themes. The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the broader spiritual implications and symbolic meanings of 'Zion' in Christian theology. However, the reference answer from the teacher emphasizes the spiritual kingdom of God and the future heavenly Jerusalem more explicitly, which the student's response could have highlighted further. Overall, the student's answer is insightful, detailed, and aligns well with a Christian specific worldview."
