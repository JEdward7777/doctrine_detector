  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the materials commonly used to construct altars during biblical times, drawing from various specific examples and references from the Old Testament. They demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of different materials in cultural and religious contexts. The additional insight provided regarding the focus on Jesus Christ's sacrifice in Christian theology was a valuable contribution to the discussion. However, the student could have mentioned the use of packed dirt as a common material for altars, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong and well-researched response."
