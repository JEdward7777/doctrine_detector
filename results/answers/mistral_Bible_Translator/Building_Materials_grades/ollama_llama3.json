  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response provides some general information about the materials used to construct altars, mentioning packed dirt or large stones as common materials, and also noting the use of wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze for special altars. However, it lacks specificity and detail compared to the provided answer, which mentions a broader range of materials (stone, unhewn stones, earth, unbaked bricks, wood, metal, rams' horns, and bull's horns) and references biblical passages.\n\nThe concern is also not fully addressed, as the response does not explicitly connect the materials and structure of altars to deepening a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and reverence in worship. While it may be implied that knowing about altars can enhance worship, this connection is not explicitly made.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could provide more specific examples from the Bible, such as those mentioned in the original answer, and connect these to the concern about deepening a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and reverence in worship."
