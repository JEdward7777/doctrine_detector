  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses that emphasize the importance of personal sanctification and growth in holiness for believers. However, the student could have directly referenced the command to believers to sanctify themselves to God, as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, a good understanding of the topic but could have been more direct in addressing the specific command given to believers regarding their personal sanctification."
