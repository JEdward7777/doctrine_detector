  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written response that clearly articulates the importance of personal sanctification for believers, referencing relevant passages from Thessalonians and Ephesians. It highlights the role of the Holy Spirit and spiritual leaders in the process of growth and maturity. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit statement regarding the command to believers to actively engage in the process of sanctification."
