  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does a good job of emphasizing the importance of personal sanctification for believers, citing relevant Scripture passages from the New Testament. The discussion of Ephesians 5:26-27 is particularly strong, as it highlights the role of spiritual leaders in equipping believers for works of service and growth in holiness.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response could be strengthened by further elaboration on what this looks like in practical terms. For example, while the response mentions that believers are called to grow in holiness and maturity, it could provide more concrete examples or suggestions for how individuals can prioritize personal sanctification in their daily lives.\n\nOverall, I would say that this response is a good start, but could benefit from some additional development to really drive home the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process."
