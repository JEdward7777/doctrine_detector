## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 As a Christian Bible translator, I would refer to several passages that emphasize the importance of personal sanctification for believers. One such passage is found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3 (NIV), which says, "For God did not call us to impurity but to holiness." Additionally, Ephesians 5:26-27 (NIV) states, "So he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ." These verses emphasize the need for believers to grow in holiness and maturity through the work of the Holy Spirit and the teaching of spiritual leaders.
