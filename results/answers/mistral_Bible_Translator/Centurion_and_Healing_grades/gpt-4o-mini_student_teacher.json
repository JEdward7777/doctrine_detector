  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive analysis of the interaction between the centurion and Jesus, highlighting key aspects of faith and authority. The response effectively discusses the centurion's recognition of Jesus' authority, his humility and transcending faith, and the value of service. However, there is some redundancy and slightly over-elaboration in parts of the answer, which could be more concise. Additionally, the student could have tied their points more directly to the understanding of faith and authority in Jesus' ministry, as specified in the concern."
