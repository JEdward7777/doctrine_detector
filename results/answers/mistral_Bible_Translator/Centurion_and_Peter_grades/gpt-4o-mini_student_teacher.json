Their analysis of the significance of the Roman Centurion's faith and Peter's acceptance of it is well-argued and aligns with the Christian worldview. However, there could be more emphasis on God's love and salvation for all people, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. Integrating this aspect more explicitly would further strengthen the response."
