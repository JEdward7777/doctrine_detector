# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, the account of the Roman Centurion and his interaction with Peter (as found in Matthew 8:5-13, Luke 7:1-10) serves as a significant representation of the spreading of the Gospel to non-Jewish communities.

The centurion was a representative of the Roman Empire, which encompassed many different peoples and nationalities. In Jewish society at that time, interactions between Jews and Gentiles (non-Jews) were often limited due to religious laws and customs. The fact that this Roman officer sought out and had faith in Jesus (as exemplified by his request for help and acknowledgment of Jesus' authority), demonstrates the universal reach and relevance of Jesus' teachings, which was a significant step towards the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community.

Peter's visit to the centurion also shows acceptance and recognition of this faith among non-Jews, foreshadowing the later evangelization efforts that would lead to the growth of Christianity in Gentile communities (Acts 10). This event underlines the inclusive nature of the Gospel message, emphasizing that salvation is not limited to any one ethnicity or cultural group but available to all who believe.
