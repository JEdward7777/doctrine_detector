It accurately portrays the universal reach of Jesus' teachings and the early steps towards the expansion of the Gospel beyond the Jewish community. The only slight improvement could be a deeper exploration of the theological implications of this event in terms of the Gentiles' inclusion in the Kingdom of God."
