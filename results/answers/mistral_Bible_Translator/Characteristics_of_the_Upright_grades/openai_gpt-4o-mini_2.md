 In the biblical context, an "upright" or righteous person is one who follows God's commands and lives according to His laws. Some of the defining qualities of such a person include:

1. Integrity (Proverbs 10:9): An upright person is honest and consistent in their words and actions. They do not lie, cheat, or deceive others.

2. Moral Purity (Psalm 119:1): Upright people strive to live a life that is free from sin and devoted to God. They avoid immorality and seek to please Him in all they do.

3. Love for God and Neighbor (Mark 12:28-31): An upright person loves God with all their heart, soul, mind, and strength, and loves their neighbor as themselves. This love is demonstrated through actions, not just words.

4. Wisdom and Understanding (Proverbs 9:10-11): Upright people seek wisdom from God and strive to understand His ways. They value knowledge and insight, and use them to make wise decisions.

5. Humility (Matthew 23:12): An upright person is humble, recognizing that they are not superior to others and that all good gifts come from God. They do not seek their own glory but rather seek to glorify God in all they do.

6. Justice and Fairness (Micah 6:8): Upright people are concerned with justice and fairness, standing up for the oppressed and defending the rights of others. They do not take advantage of the weak or exploit the vulnerable.

7. Faithfulness (Psalm 15:4): Upright people are faithful to their promises and commitments. They keep their word and can be trusted.

8. Mercifulness (Matthew 5:7): An upright person is merciful, showing compassion and kindness to others, especially those in need. They do not hold grudges or seek revenge but instead forgive as they have been forgiven by God.

9. Patience (Galatians 5:22): Upright people are patient, remaining calm and composed in difficult situations. They do not react impulsively or angrily but instead seek peace and resolution.

10. Self-Control (1 Corinthians 9:25): An upright person practices self-control, disciplining their thoughts, words, and actions to align with God's will. They resist temptation and avoid behaviors that are harmful to themselves or others.
