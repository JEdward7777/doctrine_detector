  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the hierarchical structure of the priestly system in ancient Jewish society, highlighting the roles and responsibilities of the High Priest and ordinary priests. The connection to Jesus Christ as our ultimate High Priest in Christian theology is accurately mentioned. However, to improve the answer, the student could have delved deeper into the specific relationship between the chief priests and ordinary priests in terms of authority, perhaps by discussing potential conflicts or collaborations between the two groups in more detail. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated."
