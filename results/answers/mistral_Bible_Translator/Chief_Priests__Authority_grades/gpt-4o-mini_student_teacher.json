  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and well-explained response regarding the structure of religious leadership in ancient Israel, outlining the roles and responsibilities of the high priest and ordinary priests. They correctly highlighted the higher authority of the chief priests, in line with the reference answer provided by the teacher. Additionally, the incorporation of Christian parallels to the priesthood was a thoughtful touch. However, the response could have been more concise and focused solely on the relationship between the chief priests and ordinary priests, addressing the concern more directly."
