## [Answer](../Children_and_Honor.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible provides clear instructions on how children should honor their parents in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.

In Exodus 20:12, one of the Ten Commandments states, "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you." This commandment emphasizes the importance of showing respect and obedience to parents.

In Ephesians 6:1-3 (NIV), Paul writes, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother,' which is the first commandment with a promise: 'So that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.' Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord." Here, Paul reminds children to obey their parents in the context of pleasing God, and he also encourages fathers to be patient and nurturing in guiding their children.

These verses highlight the importance of honoring parents as a way to honor God, show respect, and maintain family relationships.
