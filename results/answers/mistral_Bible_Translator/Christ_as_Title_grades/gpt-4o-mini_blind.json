The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications of Jesus being referred to as \"Christ.\" The answer is well-structured and presents the information clearly. A minor improvement could be adding more specific examples from the New Testament to further support the points made. Overall, an excellent response with doctrinal correctness."
