  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thoughtful and comprehensive answer that demonstrates an understanding of the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness and its relevance to modern Christian living. The suggestions given are rooted in biblical principles and show an effort to apply these principles in a contemporary context. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to include references to specific Old Testament laws on ritual cleanliness to further emphasize the connection between the Old Testament practices and modern Christian adoption. Additionally, tying each modern practice directly to relevant biblical passages would have strengthened the response further."
