  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that includes various modern practices modern Christians can adopt to reflect the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness. They cited relevant Biblical references and offered practical suggestions for application in contemporary faith practice. The answer effectively addressed the concern by highlighting how incorporating ancient teachings can enhance spiritual growth and accountability. The student's response aligns well with a Christian specific worldview, but the grade is slightly lower due to the lack of direct reference to repentance, confession, and spiritual discipline as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
