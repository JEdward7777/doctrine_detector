Scriptural references are used effectively to support the explanation. However, there could have been a clearer distinction made between the role of a clear conscience in relation to faith and salvation, emphasizing that it is a fruit of faith rather than a means to earn salvation. Additionally, elaborating on the role of confession and repentance in maintaining a clear conscience could have enhanced the response. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound explanation."
