  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of the biblical definition of compassion and supported their answer with relevant Bible verses. They accurately described the actions associated with being compassionate according to the Bible. However, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes that compassion involves actions to help the suffering, which was not explicitly highlighted in the student's response. Incorporating this specific aspect would have strengthened the student's answer even further."
