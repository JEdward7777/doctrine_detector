## [Answer](../Compassion_Definition.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible defines compassion as a deep, empathetic concern for the suffering of others, accompanied by a desire to alleviate their pain or distress. In Hebrew, the word for compassion is "rachamim" (רַחֲמִים), which can also mean mercy, pity, or kindness. In Greek, it is "splagchnizomai" (σπλαγχνίζομαι), meaning to be moved in the inwards (or bowels) with compassion.

The actions associated with being compassionate in the Bible include:
1. Helping the needy: Proverbs 21:13 says, "Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor will also cause his own blood to be cried out." Jesus also emphasized helping the poor and needy, stating that when we do so, we are actually serving Him (Matthew 25:40).
2. Showing kindness to strangers: The Bible encourages treating strangers with kindness because they might be angels in disguise (Hebrews 13:2), or because God himself is present in them (Matthew 25:35-40).
3. Visiting the sick and imprisoned: James 1:27 states, "Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world."
4. Caring for the less fortunate: Isaiah 1:17 says, "Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow."
5. Showing love and mercy to enemies: Jesus taught in the Sermon on the Mount, "But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44).
6. Being patient and understanding with others: Galatians 6:1 says, "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, so that you don't also be tempted."

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical perspective on compassion, accurately defining it as a feeling of concern for those who are suffering, accompanied by actions to help them. The addition of specific biblical examples and verses further supports this definition, showing that compassion is not just a feeling but also an action that is expected of Christians.

However, I would deduct points because the response does not provide a comprehensive overview of the biblical concept of compassion. While it mentions some key actions associated with being compassionate, such as helping the needy and visiting the sick and imprisoned, it does not fully explore the depth and breadth of compassion in the Bible.

Additionally, while the response does mention that Jesus emphasized helping the poor and needy, it could have further developed this point to demonstrate how Jesus' teachings on compassion are a guiding principle for Christian actions towards others.
