## [Answer](../Compassionate_Actions.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Absolutely! The Bible is filled with numerous instances of individuals demonstrating compassion. Here are some examples:

1. Moses and Miriam (Exodus 2:4-10) - When Moses was born, his mother could not bear to see him suffer under Pharaoh's decree, so she placed him in a basket on the Nile River. His sister, Miriam, watched over him from a distance. When Pharaoh's daughter found and nursed Moses, Miriam suggested a Hebrew woman as a wet nurse for Moses, demonstrating compassion towards their people and their infant brother.

2. Naomi and Ruth (Ruth 1:16-17) - After the death of her husband and two sons, Naomi was left with nothing in Moab. Her daughter-in-law, Ruth, chose to stay with Naomi, saying, "Entreat me not to leave you, or to turn back from following after you; for wherever you go, I will go; and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God, my God." This act of compassion showed deep loyalty and commitment.

3. David and Mephibosheth (2 Samuel 9) - After King Saul's death, King David sought out any remaining descendants of Saul to show kindness. He found Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, who had been crippled in both feet due to a tragic accident. David invited Mephibosheth to eat at his table every day, restoring him as one of the king's sons and demonstrating compassion to someone who had lost everything.

4. Jesus (Matthew 9:36; 15:32) - Jesus is often depicted as showing great compassion towards people, particularly those in need. In Matthew 9:36, it says that when He saw the crowds, "He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd." Jesus also healed many who were sick and fed thousands of people with only a few loaves and fish, demonstrating His care for all.

5. Paul (Acts 20:35) - In Acts 20:35, the Apostle Paul tells the elders of the Ephesian church, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." This verse illustrates Paul's compassionate heart towards others and his willingness to share what he had with those in need.

These stories remind us that compassion should be a characteristic reflected in the lives of believers, just as it was in the lives of these individuals from the Bible.
