  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided detailed examples from the Bible where individuals demonstrated compassion, highlighting key moments of compassion and empathy towards others. The examples chosen effectively illustrated the concept of compassion as modeled by biblical figures. However, the student could have incorporated more diverse examples or explained how each individual's actions were reflective of compassion. Overall, a strong and well-supported answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
