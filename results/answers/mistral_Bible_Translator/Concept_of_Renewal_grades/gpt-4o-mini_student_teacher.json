  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85. \n\nWhile the student provides a thorough and detailed explanation of how restoration can be interpreted as renewal in a Christian context, they could have more explicitly focused on the transformative power of faith and God's ongoing work in a believer's life as the concern directed. The student did touch on personal renewal and the daily transformation believers experience, but these points could have been more strongly emphasized throughout the response. Additionally, incorporating more personal examples or practical applications of how this renewal plays out in a believer's life could have strengthened the connection to the transformative power of faith. Despite these areas for improvement, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic and effectively utilized biblical references to support their points."
