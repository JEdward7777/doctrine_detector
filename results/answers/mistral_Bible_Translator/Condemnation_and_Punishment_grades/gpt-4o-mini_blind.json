  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The answer provides a decent analysis of the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 in shaping our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation. The student correctly highlights the importance of mercy, compassion, and redemption over strict judgment. However, the answer lacks depth in connecting these teachings to the broader theological context of sin, justice, and the need for repentance. Drawing on key Christian doctrines such as atonement and the role of Jesus Christ in the redemption of sinners would have strengthened the answer and provided a more robust Christian worldview perspective on punishment and condemnation."
