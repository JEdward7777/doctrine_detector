  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough analysis of the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22, highlighting the importance of mercy, compassion, and redemption in our understanding of punishment. The student effectively incorporates relevant biblical references and articulates how these teachings shape our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation. However, the response could be improved by directly linking the concepts of divine justice and mercy to the interpretation of punishment in the Scriptures provided. Overall, a solid explanation with room for a bit more depth and connection to the concern presented."
