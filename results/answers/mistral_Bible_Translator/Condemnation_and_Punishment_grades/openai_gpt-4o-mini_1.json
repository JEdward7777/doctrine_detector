  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively analyzes the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22, providing a thorough explanation of how these passages influence our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation. The integration of divine mercy and justice is well-balanced and aligned with Christian teachings, emphasizing redemption and growth over strict condemnation. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further elaborate on how divine justice and mercy work together in the context of punishment to deepen the analysis."
