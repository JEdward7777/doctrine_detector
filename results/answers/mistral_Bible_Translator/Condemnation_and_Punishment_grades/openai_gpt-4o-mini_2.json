It balances the concepts of divine justice and mercy well by showcasing how punishment is viewed as an opportunity for redemption rather than solely as a form of condemnation. The integration of a Christian worldview is clear, and the response encourages a compassionate and inclusive approach towards those who have transgressed. Great work in addressing the concern provided."
