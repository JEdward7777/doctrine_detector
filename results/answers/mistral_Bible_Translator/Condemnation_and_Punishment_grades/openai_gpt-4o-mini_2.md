## [Answer](../Condemnation_and_Punishment.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In analyzing the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22, we can derive insights that influence our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation.

Matthew 12:7 states, "But if you had known what this phrase means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent." This verse is from Jesus's teaching about healing the man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, and it suggests that God desires compassion, love, and understanding more than strict adherence to religious laws or rules. This perspective encourages us to view punishment as an opportunity for redemption rather than as a means of condemnation. It emphasizes that people should be shown mercy and given the chance to change their ways, rather than being punished solely for the sake of retribution.

Psalm 34:22 also provides insights into our understanding of punishment and condemnation: "The LORD redeems His servant, and He will come to Him who fears Him, And he will call out to him, and he will hear and fear him." This verse emphasizes that those who turn to the Lord in fear and trust will be heard and saved. It suggests that punishment is not intended as a condemnation but as an opportunity for growth, guidance, and eventual redemption. The focus is on God's grace and mercy rather than on retribution or condemnation.

In summary, these teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalm 34:22 shape our perspective on punishment as a form of condemnation by encouraging us to see it as an opportunity for redemption and growth, emphasizing mercy, compassion, and grace over retribution or strict adherence to rules. This view encourages a more inclusive and empathetic approach when dealing with those who have transgressed or made mistakes.
