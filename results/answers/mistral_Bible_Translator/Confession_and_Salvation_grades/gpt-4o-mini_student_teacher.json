  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the relationship between confessing Jesus as Lord and being saved according to Paul's writings. They effectively referenced relevant Scripture passages and highlighted the significance of also believing in Jesus' resurrection for salvation. The student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer and presents a solid understanding of the theological implications of confession and belief in salvation from a Christian perspective. Great job!"
