## [Answer](../Confession_and_Salvation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Apostle Paul's teachings in the New Testament, confessing that Jesus is Lord and believing in Him are essential for salvation. In Romans 10:9, Paul writes, "That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

Paul further expounds on this concept in other letters, such as in Philippians 2:11, where he encourages Christians to "Confess Jesus as Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

It is important to note that salvation through confessing Jesus as Lord also requires a belief in Jesus' resurrection (Romans 10:9), as this demonstrates His divine nature and power over sin and death.

In summary, according to Paul's writings, confession of faith in Jesus as Lord is an essential component of salvation, along with believing in His resurrection. This is often referred to as professing one's faith or making a personal declaration of allegiance to Christ.
