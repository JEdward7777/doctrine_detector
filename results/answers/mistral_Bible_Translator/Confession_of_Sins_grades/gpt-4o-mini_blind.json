  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComments: The student has provided a solid and accurate response based on biblical passages that instruct on how a Christian should handle temptation. They have correctly highlighted the importance of resisting temptation, seeking God's help, and utilizing the armor of God to stand firm in faith. The inclusion of relevant Scripture passages supports their answer effectively. One area of improvement could be to expand a bit more on the concept of repentance and seeking forgiveness in the process of overcoming sin."
