  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer supported by relevant biblical passages on how a Christian should respond to temptation. However, the crucial aspect of acknowledging personal sin and seeking God's forgiveness was not explicitly addressed in the response. In a Christian worldview, the acknowledgment of personal sin and seeking God's forgiveness is essential in the process of overcoming temptation and living a faithful life. The student could have included a specific emphasis on confession and seeking forgiveness in their response to align more closely with the importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness."
