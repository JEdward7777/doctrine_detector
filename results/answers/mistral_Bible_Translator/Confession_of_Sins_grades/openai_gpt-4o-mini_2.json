It incorporates relevant scripture passages and emphasizes the need to rely on God's strength to overcome sin. The specific concern about confessing sins and God's forgiveness is addressed indirectly through the emphasis on seeking God's help and acknowledging the need for His strength in the face of temptation. Including a direct reference to the importance of confessing sins for receiving God's forgiveness would have strengthened the response further."
