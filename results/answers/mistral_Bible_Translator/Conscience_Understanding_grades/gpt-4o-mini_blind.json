  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid overview of the biblical definition of conscience and its function according to Christian beliefs. The answer appropriately references key Bible passages and highlights the role of conscience in guiding moral decision-making. However, there could be improved clarity and depth in explaining how the conscience is shaped by various influences and how Christians are called to align their consciences with God's will more explicitly. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the convicting and guiding work of the Holy Spirit in the believer's conscience would enhance the answer."
