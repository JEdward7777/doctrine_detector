  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and well-explained answer concerning the biblical definition of conscience and its function according to Christian beliefs. They appropriately reference key Bible verses to support their explanation. However, the student could enhance their response by focusing more on how the conscience specifically functions as a tool given by God to guide moral decision-making based on His will. Strengthening this connection would further solidify the answer in relation to Christian beliefs."
