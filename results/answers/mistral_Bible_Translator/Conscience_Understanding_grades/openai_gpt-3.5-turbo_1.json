  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides an in-depth explanation of the Christian concept of conscience, referencing relevant Bible verses and highlighting the importance of understanding conscience for moral decision-making in a Christian context. The explanation is clear, well-supported by scripture, and aligns well with a Christian worldview. The response could have been slightly improved by elaborating on how one can actively nurture and strengthen their conscience through prayer, scripture study, and fellowship with other believers."
