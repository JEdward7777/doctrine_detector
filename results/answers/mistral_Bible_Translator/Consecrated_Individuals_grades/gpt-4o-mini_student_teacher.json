  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of individuals consecrated to God in the Bible, including specific examples and key details. They demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of consecration in biblical history. However, the reference answer from the teacher focused on priests, the people of Israel, and the oldest male child, which the student did not mention. Encouraging the student to align their response more closely with the specified concern will further strengthen their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
