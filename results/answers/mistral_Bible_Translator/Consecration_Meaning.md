 In a Christian context, consecration refers to the act of setting something or someone apart for sacred use or service to God. It is often associated with a spiritual purification or dedication. This concept can be found throughout the Bible, such as when Aaron and his sons were consecrated as priests in Exodus 29:1-9, or when Samuel anointed Saul as king of Israel in 1 Samuel 10:1.
