## [Answer](../Consequences_of_Evil.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, evil and its consequences are extensively discussed. Here are some examples:

1. Genesis 3 (The Fall): In this account, Adam and Eve disobey God by eating from the forbidden tree. As a consequence, they experience shame, guilt, and punishment. They are expelled from the Garden of Eden, and their lives become difficult and filled with toil. Furthermore, sin and death enter the world, affecting all human beings.

2. Exodus 20:5 (The Fifth Commandment): God warns the Israelites that if they break the commandments, they will face severe consequences. In this verse, He states that He visits "the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me." This suggests that the sins of the parents can have an impact on their descendants for several generations.

3. Proverbs 10:24 (The Book of Proverbs): In this book, wisdom is often portrayed as a way to avoid evil and its consequences. For example, in Proverbs 10:24, it states that "A man's steps are established by the LORD, and He delights in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the LORD upholds him with His hand." This verse suggests that while we may stumble or sin, God is there to help us get back on the right path and avoid being "utterly cast down."

4. Proverbs 16:18 (The Book of Proverbs): In this verse, it states that "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." This suggests that pride and arrogance can lead to our own downfall.

5. Romans 6:23 (The Epistle to the Romans): In this passage, Paul writes that "the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." This verse emphasizes that sin carries a heavy price – spiritual and often physical death – but that through faith in Jesus Christ, we can receive the gift of eternal life.

These examples demonstrate that evil has significant consequences, both for individuals and society as a whole. However, they also illustrate God's love and mercy, as He offers salvation and forgiveness to those who repent and put their faith in Him.
