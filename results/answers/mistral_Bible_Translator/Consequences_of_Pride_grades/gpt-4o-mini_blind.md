## [Answer](../Consequences_of_Pride.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible presents both pride and humility as significant character traits that significantly impact an individual's relationship with God, self, and others. Here are some key verses that illustrate the consequences of pride and the importance of humility:

1. Proverbs 16:18 - "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." This verse highlights that pride can lead to one's downfall and ruin, emphasizing the destructive nature of arrogance.

2. Proverbs 29:23 - "A man's pride will bring him low, but the humble in spirit will retain honor." In this verse, we see the contrast between pride resulting in a fall and humility leading to honor or respect.

3. Proverbs 18:12 - "Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty, and before honor is humility." This verse emphasizes that humility should come before honor, signifying that true recognition comes from being humble rather than seeking it through arrogance or pride.

4. James 4:6 - "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." In this New Testament passage, we find that God resists those who are filled with pride, while extending His grace and favor towards those who remain humble.

5. Matthew 23:12 - "For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted." This verse demonstrates Jesus' teaching that a person should not seek self-exaltation but instead should seek humility, as God will exalt them in return.

In summary, the Bible clearly teaches us that pride leads to destruction, while humility leads to honor and grace from God. It encourages us to strive for humility in our hearts and actions, as this is a key aspect of pleasing God and living a virtuous life.
