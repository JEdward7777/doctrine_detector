  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate description of the items contained within the Ark of the Covenant, tying them back to their significance in God's covenant with the Israelites. However, there was some additional detail that went beyond the specific items requested, which is why the grade is slightly lower than perfect. Overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic."
