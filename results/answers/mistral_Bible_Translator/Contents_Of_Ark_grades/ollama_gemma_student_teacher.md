## [Answer](../Contents_Of_Ark.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Ark of the Covenant, as described in the Old Testament of the Bible, contained three specific items:

1. Two Tablets of Stone: These tablets contained the Ten Commandments that God had written with His own finger (Exodus 24:12, Exodus 31:18). Moses received these commandments from God on Mount Sinai and placed them in the Ark (Exodus 25:21-22).

2. A Pot of Manna: This pot contained a portion of manna, bread from heaven that God had provided for the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness (Exodus 16:33).

3. Aaron's Rod: This was a rod or staff belonging to Aaron, the first high priest of Israel. It was used in the miracle of budding almond rods as a demonstration of God's power and Aaron's appointment as High Priest (Numbers 17:5-10).

The Ark also had cherubim carved on its cover (Exodus 25:18-20) and was covered with a protective veil (Exodus 40:3, 40:21). The Ark symbolized the presence of God among His people and was treated with great reverence. It accompanied the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness and was kept in the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem.
