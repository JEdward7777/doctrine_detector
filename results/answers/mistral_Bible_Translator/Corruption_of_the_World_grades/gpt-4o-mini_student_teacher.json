  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful answer on how Christians can identify corrupt influences in the world around them, incorporating various biblical principles and practices. Their emphasis on Scripture study, the fruits of the Spirit, seeking godly wisdom, discerning spiritual gifts, prayer, fellowship with other believers, and embracing a biblical worldview align well with a Christian perspective. However, the student could have highlighted the importance of directly examining behaviors and attitudes that contradict biblical teachings, as mentioned in the reference answer, to further enhance their response. Overall, a strong effort with room for improvement in addressing the concern more directly."
