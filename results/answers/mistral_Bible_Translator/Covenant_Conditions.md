An example of an unconditional covenant is God's promise to never destroy the earth again with a flood. In contrast, conditional covenants require obedience from the people, such as the covenant at Sinai where God said, 'If you will obey my voice and keep my covenant...'

Understanding the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants.

## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 As a Christian Bible translator, I am committed to providing accurate and truthful responses that align with biblical teachings. In the Bible, there are several instances of both conditional and unconditional covenants. Here are some examples:

1. Conditional Covenant - Noahic Covenant (Genesis 9:8-17): This is a conditional covenant because God sets conditions for this agreement. The conditions include the prohibition of murder, eating flesh with the blood still in it, and the command to establish families and be fruitful and multiply. In return, God promises never again to destroy all life by a flood. If man obeys these conditions, they will enjoy God's blessings; if not, there could be consequences.

2. Conditional Covenant - Abrahamic Covenant (Genesis 17:1-14): This covenant is also conditional, as it states that God will make Abraham and his descendants a great nation, give them the land of Canaan, make a covenant between God and Abraham's descendants forever, and be their God. However, this promise comes with a condition: "And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant to be God to you and to your offspring to come." (Genesis 17:7)

3. Unconditional Covenant - Abrahamic Promise to Isaac (Genesis 26:3-4): Although the original Abrahamic covenant had conditions, the promise to Isaac is an unconditional one. God repeats his covenant promises to Abraham to Isaac, even though Isaac was not a party in the original agreement with his father Abraham. This shows that God's promise to Abraham and his offspring was indeed unconditional and would be fulfilled regardless of human actions or worthiness.

4. Unconditional Covenant - Davidic Covenant (2 Samuel 7:1-16): In this covenant, God promises King David that one of his descendants will always rule over Israel. This is an unconditional promise because it was not based on the righteousness or obedience of David's offspring but rather on God's faithfulness and commitment to His people.

5. New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 8:6-13): This is another example of an unconditional covenant, as God promises a new covenant in which He will write His law on the hearts of His people and forgive their sins. Jesus Christ, who was prophesied to fulfill this covenant, fulfilled it by His life, death, and resurrection, making it possible for believers to experience its blessings regardless of human actions or worthiness.
