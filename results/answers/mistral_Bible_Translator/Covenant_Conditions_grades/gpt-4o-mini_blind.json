  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, supported by relevant scriptural references. The student effectively distinguishes between the two types of covenants and provides clear examples to illustrate each type. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of biblical teachings on covenants. One point to note is that the inclusion of some additional commentary or insight on the significance and implications of these covenants could further enhance the depth of analysis."
