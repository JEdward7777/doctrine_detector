  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates a strong understanding of both conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible, providing relevant examples and explanations. The student effectively connects the examples to the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants, showcasing a depth of knowledge and reflection. The only area for improvement would be to further elaborate on how the dynamics of God's promises and expectations are manifested in each covenant example provided. Overall, a commendable answer."
