  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of God's promises and expectations in covenants, particularly within a Christian worldview. The student provides clear examples of both conditional and unconditional covenants from the Bible and explains the conditions associated with each type of covenant. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of unconditional covenants and their implications for human salvation and redemption."
