## [Answer](../Covenant_with_Israel.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The covenant that God made with the people of Israel, as recorded in the Old Testament, is commonly referred to as the Mosaic Covenant or Sinai Covenant. It was established after the Exodus when God delivered the Israelites from Egypt and they received the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-24).

The Mosaic Covenant can be understood in terms of God's promises and the Israelites' responsibilities. God promised to make the Israelites a unique nation, bless them, and give them the Promised Land if they obeyed His laws (Exodus 19:5-6). On the other hand, if they disobeyed, they would be subject to curses and eventually be driven out of the land.

This covenant had a conditional nature, as it was based on the Israelites' obedience to God's commands. However, it should be noted that the New Testament reveals that the Mosaic Covenant was a shadow of the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ (Hebrews 8:6-13). The New Covenant is not based on human effort or obedience to laws but on God's grace through faith in Christ.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the Mosaic Covenant, highlighting God's promises to the Israelites and their responsibilities within the covenant. The connection between the covenant, God's promises, and the relationship with His chosen people is well-addressed, particularly in the context of the conditional nature of the covenant. It also effectively ties in the significance of the Mosaic Covenant as a foreshadowing of the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated.
