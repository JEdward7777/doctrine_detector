It also makes a valid connection to the New Covenant established through Jesus Christ, emphasizing the shift from law-based to grace-based relationship with God. However, it could have further elaborated on how God's promises and relationship with His chosen people were integral aspects of the covenant, to strengthen the Christian worldview perspective."
