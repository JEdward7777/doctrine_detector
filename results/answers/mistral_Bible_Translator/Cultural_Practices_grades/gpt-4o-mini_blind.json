  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of the Jewish view of Gentiles and their cultural practices, as well as their impact on early Christian practices. The student effectively highlights the tension between separation and kindness in the Jewish perspective on Gentiles, as well as the implications for early Christianity. The mention of the Council of Jerusalem and its significance in the development of early Christian practices is well articulated. The response could have been enhanced by delving deeper into the theological implications of these cultural practices and their relevance to Christian doctrine, thereby providing a more cohesive integration of a Christian worldview into the analysis."
