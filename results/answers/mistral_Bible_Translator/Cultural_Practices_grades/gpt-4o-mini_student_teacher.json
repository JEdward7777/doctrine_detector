  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-detailed response that demonstrates a good understanding of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and their impact on early Christian practices. They have discussed various aspects of the relationship between Jews and Gentiles, as well as the influence of these cultural norms on early Christian communities. However, the student could have further highlighted the specific cultural practice of avoiding eating with or associating with Gentiles, as emphasized in the reference answer, to align more closely with the specified concern of how cultural norms influence faith communities."
