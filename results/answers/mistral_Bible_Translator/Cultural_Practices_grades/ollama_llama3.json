It effectively addresses the concern about how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices. The text also does a good job of highlighting the tensions and debates within the early church regarding inclusivity and acceptance.\n\nThe response could be improved by providing more explicit connections between the Jewish views of Gentiles and the challenges faced by the early Christian community. Additionally, while the response mentions the Council of Jerusalem, it could delve deeper into the significance of this event in shaping the trajectory of Christianity.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and provides valuable insights that help to illuminate the complex relationships between cultural norms, faith communities, and practices."
