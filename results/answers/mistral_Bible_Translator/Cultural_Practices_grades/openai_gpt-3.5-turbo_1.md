# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, the relationship between Israel (the Jews) and the Gentiles (non-Israelites or non-Jews) was complex and nuanced. On one hand, there was a sense of separation and distinctiveness due to God's covenant with Israel. Deuteronomy 7:6 states, "For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession."

On the other hand, there were times when God commanded Israel to treat Gentiles with kindness and fairness, such as in Leviticus 19:34, "The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt."

However, many cultural practices and attitudes towards Gentiles reflected a sense of superiority and separation. For example, Jews were forbidden to intermarry with Gentiles (Exodus 34:16), and certain foods associated with idolatrous practices among the Gentiles were considered unclean (Leviticus 11).

These attitudes and practices had a significant impact on early Christian practices. Early Christians, who were initially Jews, continued to observe many of these Jewish customs. However, as Christianity spread to the Gentiles, there was a growing tension between those who wanted to maintain the traditional Jewish practices (the "Judaizers") and those who believed that salvation was open to all, regardless of ethnicity or adherence to Jewish laws (the "Anti-Judaizers").

This debate culminated in the Council of Jerusalem (Acts 15), where it was decided that Gentile converts were not required to be circumcised or follow Jewish food laws, but should abstain from sexual immorality, meat from strangled animals, and blood. This decision helped to solidify Christianity as a distinct religion separate from Judaism.

In summary, the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles were characterized by a sense of separation and distinctiveness, but also a call to love and treat Gentiles kindly. These attitudes had a significant impact on early Christian practices, shaping the debates and decisions that helped to define Christianity as a separate religion.
