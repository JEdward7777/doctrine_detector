The student effectively references relevant Old Testament passages and highlights the significance of Jesus' lineage, resurrection, and ascension in relation to this promise. The answer could be further strengthened by delving into the theological implications of Jesus' eternal rule and tying it back more explicitly to the overarching theme of God's redemptive plan through Christ."
