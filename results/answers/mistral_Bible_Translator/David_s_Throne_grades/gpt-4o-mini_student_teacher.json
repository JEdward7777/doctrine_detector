  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. The student demonstrates a deep understanding of the connection between the promise of David's throne lasting forever and its fulfillment in Jesus Christ. They accurately cite relevant Old Testament passages and connect them to Jesus's lineage and role as the eternal King. The response effectively highlights the significance of Jesus's reign in Christian theology, emphasizing themes of salvation, justice, and God's faithfulness. However, the response could have been improved by explicitly stating that the promise represents God's eternal covenant and sovereignty, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
