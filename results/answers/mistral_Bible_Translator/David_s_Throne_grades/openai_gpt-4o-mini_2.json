It correctly connects the Old Testament prophecies with Jesus's lineage and his resurrection and ascension as the fulfillment of this promise. The emphasis on the eternal reign and kingship of Jesus Christ and the significance of salvation, peace, justice, and righteousness being ensured through Him aligns well with Christian beliefs. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of understanding this promise for recognizing the fulfillment of God's plan through Jesus. Great job!"
