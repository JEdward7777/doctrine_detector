## [Answer](../Deacon_Definition.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Christian theology, as outlined in the New Testament books of Acts and the Epistles (specifically 1 Timothy 3:8-13 and Philippians 1:1), the primary role of a deacon in a local church is to serve the practical needs of the congregation. Deacons are appointed by the church's leadership, usually the elders or pastors, to assist with tasks such as caring for widows and orphans, distributing food and resources to those in need, managing finances, and facilitating communication between the members and leadership. They also help ensure that the physical aspects of worship services run smoothly, like organizing seating, setting up the sacramental elements (such as communion), and maintaining order during the service. The goal is to allow the elders and pastors to focus more on teaching, preaching, and prayer. Deacons are expected to live a life of integrity, demonstrated by their character, faith, and dedication to the Lord Jesus Christ.
