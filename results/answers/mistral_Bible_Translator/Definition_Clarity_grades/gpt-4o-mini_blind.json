It accurately references key Bible passages from both the Old and New Testaments and acknowledges that adultery encompasses not just physical acts but also emotional or mental infidelity. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include the understanding that adultery is not just a violation of the marriage covenant but also a sin against God Himself (Psalm 51:4)."
