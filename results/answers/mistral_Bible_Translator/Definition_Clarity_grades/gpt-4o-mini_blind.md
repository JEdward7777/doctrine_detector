## Question [Definition Clarity](../../../questions/Definition_Clarity.md)
How is the term 'adultery' defined in the Christian context according to Scripture?

## Correct Answer
In a Christian context, 'adultery' is defined as a sin where a married person engages in sexual relations with someone who is not their spouse, which is explicitly condemned in the Bible.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the Biblical definition and implications of adultery.

## [Answer](../Definition_Clarity.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Christian context, according to Scripture, adultery refers to sexual immorality between a married person and someone other than their spouse. The concept of adultery is primarily found in the Old Testament Law (Leviticus 18:20, 20:10; Deuteronomy 5:18) and is emphasized in both Testaments as a grave sin. In the New Testament, Jesus reiterates this in Matthew 19:9 when he says, "And I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery." Therefore, adultery is considered a violation of the marriage covenant. It's important to note that this definition encompasses not just physical acts but also any form of emotional or mental infidelity that threatens the sanctity of a marriage.

Grade: 90

Comment: The answer provides a solid explanation of how adultery is defined in the Christian context according to Scripture. It accurately references key Bible passages from both the Old and New Testaments and acknowledges that adultery encompasses not just physical acts but also emotional or mental infidelity. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include the understanding that adultery is not just a violation of the marriage covenant but also a sin against God Himself (Psalm 51:4).
