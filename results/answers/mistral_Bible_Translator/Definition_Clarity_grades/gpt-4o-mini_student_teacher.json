  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as a 85. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the Biblical definition of adultery according to Scripture. They correctly identify adultery as sexual immorality between a married person and someone other than their spouse, citing relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments. Additionally, they acknowledge the severity of adultery as a sin that violates the marriage covenant. The student also goes beyond the mere physical act, recognizing that emotional or mental infidelity can also be considered adultery within a Christian context. However, the student slightly deviates from the reference answer by including the specific mention of divorce in relation to adultery, which is not directly addressed in the question. This deviation could have been avoided by focusing solely on the definition of adultery as specified in the question."
