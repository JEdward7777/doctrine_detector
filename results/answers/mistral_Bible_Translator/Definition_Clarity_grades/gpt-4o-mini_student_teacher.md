## Question [Definition Clarity](../../../questions/Definition_Clarity.md)
How is the term 'adultery' defined in the Christian context according to Scripture?

## Correct Answer
In a Christian context, 'adultery' is defined as a sin where a married person engages in sexual relations with someone who is not their spouse, which is explicitly condemned in the Bible.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the Biblical definition and implications of adultery.

## [Answer](../Definition_Clarity.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Christian context, according to Scripture, adultery refers to sexual immorality between a married person and someone other than their spouse. The concept of adultery is primarily found in the Old Testament Law (Leviticus 18:20, 20:10; Deuteronomy 5:18) and is emphasized in both Testaments as a grave sin. In the New Testament, Jesus reiterates this in Matthew 19:9 when he says, "And I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery." Therefore, adultery is considered a violation of the marriage covenant. It's important to note that this definition encompasses not just physical acts but also any form of emotional or mental infidelity that threatens the sanctity of a marriage.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade this student's answer as a 85. The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the Biblical definition of adultery according to Scripture. They correctly identify adultery as sexual immorality between a married person and someone other than their spouse, citing relevant passages from both the Old and New Testaments. Additionally, they acknowledge the severity of adultery as a sin that violates the marriage covenant. The student also goes beyond the mere physical act, recognizing that emotional or mental infidelity can also be considered adultery within a Christian context. However, the student slightly deviates from the reference answer by including the specific mention of divorce in relation to adultery, which is not directly addressed in the question. This deviation could have been avoided by focusing solely on the definition of adultery as specified in the question.
