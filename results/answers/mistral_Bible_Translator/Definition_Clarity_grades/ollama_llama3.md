## Question [Definition Clarity](../../../questions/Definition_Clarity.md)
How is the term 'adultery' defined in the Christian context according to Scripture?

## Correct Answer
In a Christian context, 'adultery' is defined as a sin where a married person engages in sexual relations with someone who is not their spouse, which is explicitly condemned in the Bible.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the Biblical definition and implications of adultery.

## [Answer](../Definition_Clarity.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Christian context, according to Scripture, adultery refers to sexual immorality between a married person and someone other than their spouse. The concept of adultery is primarily found in the Old Testament Law (Leviticus 18:20, 20:10; Deuteronomy 5:18) and is emphasized in both Testaments as a grave sin. In the New Testament, Jesus reiterates this in Matthew 19:9 when he says, "And I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery." Therefore, adultery is considered a violation of the marriage covenant. It's important to note that this definition encompasses not just physical acts but also any form of emotional or mental infidelity that threatens the sanctity of a marriage.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a clear definition of adultery in a Christian context, citing relevant Scripture from both the Old and New Testaments. It also correctly emphasizes that adultery encompasses not just physical acts but also emotional or mental infidelity. The response shows a good understanding of the Biblical definition and implications of adultery.

However, the response could be improved by providing more depth and nuance in its explanation. For example, it would be helpful to explore the reasons why God considers adultery a grave sin, and how it violates the marriage covenant. Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific examples or illustrations to help illustrate the concept of emotional or mental infidelity.

Overall, while the response is strong, it could be even stronger with a bit more development and exploration of the topic.
