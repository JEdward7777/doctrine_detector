  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Christian understanding of adultery based on Scripture, including references from the Old Testament and New Testament. The inclusion of emotional or mental infidelity as part of the definition shows a deep understanding of the broader implications of adultery within marriage. The response effectively addresses the concern by delving into the Biblical definition and emphasizing the seriousness of adultery as a violation of the marriage covenant. Great job overall!"
