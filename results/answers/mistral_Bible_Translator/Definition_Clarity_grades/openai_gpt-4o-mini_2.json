  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a deep understanding of the Biblical definition and implications of adultery within a Christian context. It not only accurately defines adultery as a sin involving sexual immorality between a married person and someone other than their spouse, but also provides scriptural references from both the Old and New Testaments to support this definition. Additionally, the explanation on how emotional or mental infidelity can also threaten the sanctity of a marriage shows a nuanced understanding of the topic. Overall, this response is well-informed and effectively addresses the concern provided."
