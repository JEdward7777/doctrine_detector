  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student provided a thorough list of alternative translations for the term 'intercede' as used in Scripture, including relevant verses to support each translation. They demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of intercession and how it is portrayed in different contexts within the Bible. However, some of the translations provided were a bit repetitive or overlapped in their meanings, which could have been consolidated for a more concise response.\n\nOverall, the student showed a strong grasp of the topic and effectively supported their translations with appropriate Biblical references."
