1. Plead on behalf of: Found in Romans 8:34, where it says "Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us." Here, 'intercede' can be translated as 'pleading on behalf of'.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides a thorough breakdown of various passages that demonstrate Christ's intercession, including Romans 8:34, 1 Timothy 2:5, 1 John 2:1, and Romans 8:26-27. The different alternatives for "intercede" (plead on behalf of, mediate, advocate, make supplication, intervene, interpose, stand in the gap, make petition, appeal, and make intercession) are all clearly explained and supported by biblical references.

The concern about clarifying the meaning and application of intercession in different contexts is also well-addressed. The response demonstrates a good understanding of how Christ's intercession applies to different situations, including pleading for mercy, intervening in conflict, and standing in the gap on behalf of humanity.

However, there is one area where the response could be improved: it would be helpful to provide more context about why these examples are significant or how they relate to each other. Additionally, some of the explanations could be further expanded upon to better illustrate the meaning and application of intercession.

Overall, this is a strong response that effectively clarifies the concept of intercession in different contexts and provides a wealth of biblical support for its claims.
