Comment: The response effectively uses biblical references to explain the concept of intercession in various contexts, connecting it to different terms like plead, mediate, advocate, make supplication, intervene, interpose, stand in the gap, make petition, appeal, and make intercession. The additional translation provided further enriches the understanding of intercession. The integration of Scripture and the clarification of meanings demonstrate a strong grasp of the Christian worldview on intercession. Great work!
