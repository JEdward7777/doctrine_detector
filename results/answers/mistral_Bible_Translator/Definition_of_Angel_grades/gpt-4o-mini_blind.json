  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of the biblical definition of angels and their primary role according to Christian theology. The student correctly emphasizes the role of angels as messengers and servants of God, highlighting key biblical references. The explanation of angels not having free will like humans, their obedience to God's will, and the importance of worshiping God alone aligns well with Christian doctrine. The response could be strengthened by including more Scriptural references to support the points made."
