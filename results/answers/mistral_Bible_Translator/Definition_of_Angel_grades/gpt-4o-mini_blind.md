## [Answer](../Definition_of_Angel.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, angels are spiritual beings created by God. They are often depicted as messengers or servants carrying out God's will (Hebrew: mal'akh - "messenger"). The Bible describes them as being in the presence of God (Psalm 91:11), ministering to humans (Luke 1:26-38, Acts 5:19-20), and serving as guardians or protectors (Daniel 6:22). They are not human, but they can appear in human form. The primary role of angels is to serve God by acting as intermediaries between Him and humanity, delivering messages, and protecting and guiding His people. They are considered to be messengers of salvation, peace, and good news (Luke 2:14).

In addition, it's important to note that angels do not have free will like humans do; they do not sin, and their actions are always in accordance with the will of God. Furthermore, while there are many references to angels in the Bible, there is no specific commandment for believers to worship angels as some religious practices outside of Christianity suggest. Instead, our focus should be on serving God, who alone is worthy of our worship (Revelation 19:10).

Comment: This response provides a solid understanding of the biblical definition of angels and their primary role according to Christian theology. The student correctly emphasizes the role of angels as messengers and servants of God, highlighting key biblical references. The explanation of angels not having free will like humans, their obedience to God's will, and the importance of worshiping God alone aligns well with Christian doctrine. The response could be strengthened by including more Scriptural references to support the points made.
