  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the biblical definition of angels and their primary role. They mention key biblical references and emphasize the role of angels as messengers and servants of God. The student also correctly highlights that angels do not have free will like humans and that worship should be directed towards God alone, aligning well with a Christian worldview. However, the answer could have been enhanced by directly addressing the concern of how understanding the role of angels can deepen faith and provide assurance of God's protection and guidance. Adding a more personal or reflective touch to the explanation could have further strengthened the connection between faith and the role of angels."
