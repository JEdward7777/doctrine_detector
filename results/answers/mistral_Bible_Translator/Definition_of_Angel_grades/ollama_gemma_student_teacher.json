  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical definition of an angel and their primary role. It accurately describes their spiritual nature, role as messengers, and their presence in the presence of God. Additionally, the student provides relevant examples from scripture to support their claims. The only area for improvement would be to elaborate more on the specific ways angels minister to humans."
