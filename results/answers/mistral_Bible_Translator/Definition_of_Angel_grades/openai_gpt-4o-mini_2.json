It acknowledges their importance in delivering messages, protecting, and guiding believers, thus contributing to deepening faith and providing assurance of God's presence and care. The mention of angels not having free will and always aligning with God's will is consistent with Christian beliefs. Overall, this response addresses the concern effectively within a Christian worldview."
