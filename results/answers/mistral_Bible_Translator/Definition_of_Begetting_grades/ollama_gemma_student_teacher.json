They clearly explain its literal meaning as biological parenthood and its spiritual significance in Christian theology. The inclusion of references from the New Testament and Christian theology supports their argument. Additionally, the student acknowledges the uniqueness of Jesus Christ's birth and the metaphorical use of \"beget\" in relation to the Incarnation."
