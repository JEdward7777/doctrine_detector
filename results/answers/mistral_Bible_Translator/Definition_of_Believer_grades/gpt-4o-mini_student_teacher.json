  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate answer citing relevant biblical verses to support their explanation of who is classified as a believer. They correctly emphasized belief in Jesus Christ as Savior, in alignment with the reference answer. However, the student could have further highlighted the importance of faith and reliance on Christ for salvation in their response. Overall, a strong understanding of the concept of being a believer in Christ was demonstrated."
