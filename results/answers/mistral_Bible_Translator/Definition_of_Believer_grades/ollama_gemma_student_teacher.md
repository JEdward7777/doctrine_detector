## [Answer](../Definition_of_Believer.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Bible, anyone who believes in and follows Jesus Christ is considered a believer. In John 3:16, it states, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." In this passage, "whoever" refers to anyone who believes in Jesus. Furthermore, in Romans 10:9-10, it is written, "If you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved." This passage emphasizes both the intellectual assent (believing in one's heart) and the verbal confession of faith as essential elements for being a believer. In summary, according to the Bible, anyone who believes and follows Jesus Christ is classified as a believer.
