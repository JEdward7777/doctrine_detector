 In a biblical context, the term "beloved" often denotes a special affection or deep love, usually between God and His people, or among individuals within the community of believers. It is used to express a close, cherished relationship and often implies a sense of favor, grace, and protection. For instance, in Matthew 3:17, when God the Father speaks from heaven at Jesus' baptism, He refers to Jesus as "My beloved Son," emphasizing their unique and intimate bond. Similarly, in 1 John 4:19, the apostle John says that we love because He first loved us, implying that our love for God is a response to His initial love for us.
