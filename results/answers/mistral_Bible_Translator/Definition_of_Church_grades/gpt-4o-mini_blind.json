  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and doctrinally sound explanation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament. It accurately conveys the spiritual nature of the church as a community of believers called out by Christ, emphasizing its functions and purpose as presented in the Bible. The references to relevant scripture passages enhance the theological depth of the answer. The only minor improvement could be to perhaps include a brief mention of the role of church leadership appointed by Christ (such as elders and deacons) to provide a more holistic understanding. Otherwise, well done."
