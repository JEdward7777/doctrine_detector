  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament, emphasizing its spiritual nature and importance beyond just a physical building. The student effectively highlighted the various roles and functions of the church as presented in scripture. However, the student could have further emphasized the aspect of believers gathering together, as mentioned in the reference answer, and related it more explicitly to the understanding of the church as a community of believers."
