## [Answer](../Definition_of_Church.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, the term "church" (Greek: ekklÄ“sia) primarily refers to a community or assembly of believers in Jesus Christ who have been called out from the world and gathered together under His name. It is not simply a physical building or institution but rather a spiritual entity composed of those who have faith in Christ, are baptized, and participate in fellowship, worship, and service as guided by the teachings of the Bible.

The church serves several important functions in the New Testament, including proclaiming the gospel message, providing pastoral care, encouraging one another in faith, and growing in spiritual maturity together (Matthew 16:18; Acts 2:42-47; Ephesians 4:11-16). The church is also a reflection of God's kingdom here on earth and is tasked with extending the love and grace of Christ to the world around it (Matthew 5:13-16).

It is important to note that while the New Testament presents the church as essential for believers, it does not establish a specific organizational structure or hierarchy. Instead, it emphasizes humility, mutual submission, and love within the community of faith (Philippians 2:3-4; 1 Peter 5:5). Ultimately, the church is called to be a living demonstration of Christ's character and mission in the world today.
