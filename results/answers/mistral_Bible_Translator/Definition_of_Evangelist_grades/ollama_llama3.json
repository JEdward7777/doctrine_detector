  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response correctly conveys the general idea that the term \"evangelist\" comes from the Greek words for \"good\" and \"messenger,\" and it accurately describes the role of evangelists in sharing the Christian faith. However, the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation of the concept.\n\nFor example, while the response mentions that an evangelist can refer to a person who shares the Christian faith actively and systematically, it does not elaborate on what this might look like in practical terms. Additionally, the response does not explicitly mention the importance of personal testimony or the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering evangelists to share their faith.\n\nOverall, while the response is generally accurate and informative, it could be more thorough and insightful in its treatment of the topic.\n\nComment: This response provides a good foundation for understanding the concept of an evangelist, but could benefit from additional depth and detail."
