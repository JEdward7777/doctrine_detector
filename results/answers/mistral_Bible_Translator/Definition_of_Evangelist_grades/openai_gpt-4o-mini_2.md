Understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Evangelist.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The term "Evangelist" comes from the Greek word εὐαγγέλιστος (euangélistos), which is composed of two roots: εὖ (eu), meaning "good," and ἄγγελος (ángelos), meaning "messenger" or "herald." The term "Evangelist" therefore refers to a "good messenger" or "herald of good news." In Christian context, it is often used to describe the four authors of the biblical books known as the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) who were messengers of the Good News about Jesus Christ. It can also refer to a person who shares the Christian faith actively and systematically in Christian communities.
