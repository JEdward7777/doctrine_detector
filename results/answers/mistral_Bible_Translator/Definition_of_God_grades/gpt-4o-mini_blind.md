How does the Bible define the characteristics and nature of God?

The Bible defines God as the eternal being who created the universe, existing as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is described as perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.

## Stated Concern
Understanding God's nature truthfully is essential for proper worship and relationship with Him.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_God.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible presents God as an all-powerful, all-knowing, eternal, and omnipresent being. He is described as perfectly loving, just, holy, and faithful. In the Old Testament, God is often referred to as "Yahweh" or "Jehovah," with characteristics such as a creator (Genesis 1:1), a provider (Exodus 16:4), a judge (Deuteronomy 32:4), and a redeemer (Isaiah 43:1). In the New Testament, God is often portrayed as love personified (1 John 4:8) and the source of all grace (Ephesians 1:3). He is also described as triune, meaning one God in three distinct persons - the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. This concept is further explained in the Nicene Creed, a statement of Christian belief adopted in 325 AD. The Bible also emphasizes that God is unchangeable (Malachi 3:6) and that He cannot lie (Titus 1:2). His nature and characteristics are consistent, holy, and perfect.
