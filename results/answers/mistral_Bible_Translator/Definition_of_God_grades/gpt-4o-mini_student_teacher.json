  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing the characteristics and nature of God as presented in the Bible, including references from both the Old and New Testaments. However, their answer slightly deviated from the reference answer by not explicitly mentioning God's sinless and infinitely wise nature. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of God's nature as described in the Bible, but there is room for improvement in aligning the response more closely with the specific attributes highlighted in the reference answer."
