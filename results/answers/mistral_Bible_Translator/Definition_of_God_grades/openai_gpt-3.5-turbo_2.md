## Stated Concern
Understanding God's nature truthfully is essential for proper worship and relationship with Him.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_God.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible presents God as an all-powerful, all-knowing, eternal, and omnipresent being. He is described as perfectly loving, just, holy, and faithful. In the Old Testament, God is often referred to as "Yahweh" or "Jehovah," with characteristics such as a creator (Genesis 1:1), a provider (Exodus 16:4), a judge (Deuteronomy 32:4), and a redeemer (Isaiah 43:1). In the New Testament, God is often portrayed as love personified (1 John 4:8) and the source of all grace (Ephesians 1:3). He is also described as triune, meaning one God in three distinct persons - the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. This concept is further explained in the Nicene Creed, a statement of Christian belief adopted in 325 AD. The Bible also emphasizes that God is unchangeable (Malachi 3:6) and that He cannot lie (Titus 1:2). His nature and characteristics are consistent, holy, and perfect.
