## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of the Bible, the terms "good" and "evil" often describe moral qualities that distinguish between righteousness and sin, obedience to God and disobedience, love and hatred.

The Hebrew term for good is "tov," which generally signifies something beneficial, pleasant, or morally upright. In Genesis 1:31, after creating the world, God saw that it was "good" (tov). In this context, "good" refers to the harmonious order and perfection of creation as a reflection of God's nature.

On the other hand, the term for evil is "ra'," which means ruin, calamity, wickedness, or moral wrongdoing. It represents the opposite of God's goodness, characterized by disobedience to His commands and a rebellion against His will. In Genesis 3:1, when the serpent tempted Eve, it called God's command not to eat from the tree in the middle of the garden "evil" (ra').

In summary, the Biblical definition of 'good' contrasts with 'evil' in that 'good' is associated with God, His nature, and obedience to His commands, while 'evil' is linked with sin, rebellion, and disobedience to God. The ultimate goal for Christians is to pursue a life of righteousness and goodness as demonstrated by Jesus Christ.
