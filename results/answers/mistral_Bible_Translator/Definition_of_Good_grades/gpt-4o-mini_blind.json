  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a clear and concise explanation of the Biblical definitions of 'good' and 'evil,' supported by relevant scriptural references. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of how these terms are used in the Bible and correctly contrasts them based on God's nature and commands. The integration of key passages from Genesis enhances the explanation. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
