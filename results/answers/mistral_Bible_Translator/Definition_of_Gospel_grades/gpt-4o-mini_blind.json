  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"Gospel\" both in its etymology and biblical context. The student effectively connects the term to the four Gospels in the New Testament and explains the broader concept of the Gospel message in Christianity. The reference to the Apostles' Creed further adds depth to the explanation. A minor improvement could be to include a mention of the importance of repentance and faith in response to the Gospel message. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
