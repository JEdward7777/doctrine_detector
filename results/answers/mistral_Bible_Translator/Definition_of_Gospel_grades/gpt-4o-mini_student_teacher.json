  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the term \"Gospel\" and its significance in Christian faith. They accurately described the term's origin and its broader implications in Christianity. Their answer aligns well with the reference answer, but could have been slightly improved by emphasizing the role of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross as central to the Gospel message. Overall, a strong response demonstrating a good understanding of the definition and significance of the Gospel in Christian faith."
