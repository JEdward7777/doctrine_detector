## [Answer](../Definition_of_Gospel.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The term "Gospel" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word God-spel, Old English for "Good News". In the New Testament of the Bible, the Gospels are the four books that tell the story of the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The four Gospels are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Each Gospel provides a unique perspective on Jesus' ministry, and together they present a comprehensive account of His life and teachings.

The term "Gospel" has come to be used more broadly in Christianity as the message or good news that Jesus came to save humanity from sin and reconcile them with God through faith in Him. This message is central to Christian belief and is often summarized in the Apostles' Creed: "I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; He descended to the dead. On the third day He rose again; He ascended into heaven, is seated at the right hand of the Father, and will come again to judge the living and the dead."

In summary, the term "Gospel" means good news, specifically the message that Jesus Christ came to save humanity from sin through His death and resurrection.
