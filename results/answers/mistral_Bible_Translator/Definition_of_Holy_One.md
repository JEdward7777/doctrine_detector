## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the term "Holy One" is used primarily to describe God and His unique nature. The holiness of God signifies His perfection, righteousness, purity, and separation from sin or evil. It is one of the essential attributes of God that sets Him apart from all creation.

The holy one is also referred to as Yahweh Tzva'ot (יְהוָ֣ה צְבַ֔אוֹת) in the Hebrew Bible, which means "the Lord of hosts" or "Sovereign of the armies." This title emphasizes God's might and sovereignty over all creation.

In addition to God, certain individuals in the Bible are also referred to as "holy ones," including angels, prophets, and the righteous. However, their holiness is derived from God and serves as a reflection of His nature rather than being inherently holy in themselves.

The concept of holiness in the Bible is closely linked with sanctification, which refers to the process of becoming more like God through obedience to His commands and separation from sin. The call to "be holy, for I the Lord your God am holy" (Leviticus 19:2) serves as a reminder that followers of God are called to imitate their Holy Creator in their lives.

Overall, the term "Holy One" in the Bible highlights God's transcendent and unique nature, His righteousness, purity, and separation from sin, and the call for His people to reflect this holiness in their own lives through obedience and sanctification.
