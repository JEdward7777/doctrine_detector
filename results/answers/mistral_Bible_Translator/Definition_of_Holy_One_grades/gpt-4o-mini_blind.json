  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible. They correctly emphasized the attributes of God's holiness, His separation from sin, and highlighted the connection between holiness and sanctification. The inclusion of Yahweh Tzva'ot as a title for God was a good addition. However, the student could have delved deeper into the scriptural references and the theological implications of holiness in the Christian worldview to enhance the depth of their answer."
