It effectively addresses the concern by exploring how the term is used in both the Old and New Testaments to highlight God's holiness, particularly in the context of the 'Holy One of Israel' and Jesus. The integration of biblical references and theological concepts demonstrates a strong understanding of the holiness of God and His significant role in scripture."
