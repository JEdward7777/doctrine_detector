It effectively addresses the concern by delving into the design and function of God's dwelling place, highlighting its role as a sacred space for God's presence. Additionally, the Christian worldview perspective is well-integrated by drawing parallels between the Old Testament Holy Place and the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ in the New Testament."
