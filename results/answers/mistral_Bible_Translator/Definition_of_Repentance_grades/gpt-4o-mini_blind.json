  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a solid explanation of repentance according to the Bible. It accurately describes repentance as a sincere change of mind and heart leading to turning away from sin and towards God. The response includes relevant biblical references and emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for forgiveness. The only improvement could be a deeper exploration of the concept of repentance in terms of the believer's ongoing journey of sanctification after initial repentance."
