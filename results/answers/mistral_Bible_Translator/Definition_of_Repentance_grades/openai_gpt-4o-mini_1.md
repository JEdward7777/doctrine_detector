## [Answer](../Definition_of_Repentance.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, repentance refers to a sincere change of mind and heart that results in turning away from sin and turning towards God. It involves acknowledging one's sins and transgressions, confessing them to God and seeking His forgiveness. Repentance is not just about feeling sorry for wrongdoings but about making a commitment to live according to God's will and commands.

The concept of repentance can be found throughout the Old and New Testaments, with key verses such as Jonah 3:8-10, which describes Nineveh's repentance and God's mercy in sparing them from destruction, and Luke 24:47, where Jesus instructed His disciples to preach about repentance.

Repentance is often accompanied by faith in Jesus Christ as the Savior, who paid the penalty for our sins through His death on the cross and offers forgiveness and eternal life to those who believe in Him (Romans 3:21-26). In essence, repentance is a turning back to God in obedience and faith, driven by a desire to live in accordance with His will and please Him.
