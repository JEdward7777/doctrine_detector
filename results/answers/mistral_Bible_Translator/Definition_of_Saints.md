## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" (Greek: hagios) refers to all believers in Jesus Christ who have been set apart or made holy by God through faith in Him. It is not a title restricted to any specific group within the church but includes every person who has accepted salvation through Jesus. The concept of sainthood as it is often understood today, which focuses on individuals recognized for exceptional holiness, comes from later tradition and development within the Christian Church, rather than being directly indicated in the New Testament texts themselves. It's essential to remember that all Christians are considered saints, as they have been sanctified by God through the work of Christ on the cross and the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.
