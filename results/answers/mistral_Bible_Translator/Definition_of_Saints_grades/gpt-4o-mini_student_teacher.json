  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed explanation of the term \"saints\" in the context of the New Testament, emphasizing that all believers in Jesus Christ are considered saints. While the response goes beyond the reference answer by discussing the development of the concept of sainthood in the Christian Church, it remains in alignment with a Christian worldview. The explanation could be improved by focusing more on the biblical definition of saints and delving deeper into scriptural references to support the points made."
