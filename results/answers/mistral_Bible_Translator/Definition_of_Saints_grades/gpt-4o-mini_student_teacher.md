## Question [Definition of Saints](../../../questions/Definition_of_Saints.md)
What does the term 'saints' mean in the context of the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
The term 'saints' literally means 'holy ones' and refers to believers in Jesus.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints helps to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" (Greek: hagios) refers to all believers in Jesus Christ who have been set apart or made holy by God through faith in Him. It is not a title restricted to any specific group within the church but includes every person who has accepted salvation through Jesus. The concept of sainthood as it is often understood today, which focuses on individuals recognized for exceptional holiness, comes from later tradition and development within the Christian Church, rather than being directly indicated in the New Testament texts themselves. It's essential to remember that all Christians are considered saints, as they have been sanctified by God through the work of Christ on the cross and the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.

Comment: The student's answer provides a detailed explanation of the term "saints" in the context of the New Testament, emphasizing that all believers in Jesus Christ are considered saints. While the response goes beyond the reference answer by discussing the development of the concept of sainthood in the Christian Church, it remains in alignment with a Christian worldview. The explanation could be improved by focusing more on the biblical definition of saints and delving deeper into scriptural references to support the points made.
