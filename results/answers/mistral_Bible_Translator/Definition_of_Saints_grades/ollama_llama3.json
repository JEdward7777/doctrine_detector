  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThe main strength of this response is that it correctly identifies the biblical definition of saints as referring to believers in Jesus Christ, which aligns with the correct answer provided. The response also highlights an important distinction between cultural and scriptural interpretations, addressing the concern specified.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, while the response mentions that the term \"saints\" literally means \"holy ones\", it could be more specific about what this term means in the context of the New Testament. The provided response doesn't explicitly state that all believers in Jesus Christ are considered saints, which is an important point to make.\n\nAdditionally, the response could benefit from a clearer explanation of how cultural and scriptural interpretations differ. While it mentions the importance of distinguishing between these two, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples or illustrations to drive this point home.\n\nOverall, while the response provides a good foundation for understanding the biblical definition of saints, it could be strengthened with additional details and examples to further address the concern specified."
