## Question [Definition of Saints](../../../questions/Definition_of_Saints.md)
What does the term 'saints' mean in the context of the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
The term 'saints' literally means 'holy ones' and refers to believers in Jesus.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the correct Biblical definition of saints helps to distinguish between cultural and scriptural interpretations.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of the New Testament, the term "saints" (Greek: hagios) refers to all believers in Jesus Christ who have been set apart or made holy by God through faith in Him. It is not a title restricted to any specific group within the church but includes every person who has accepted salvation through Jesus. The concept of sainthood as it is often understood today, which focuses on individuals recognized for exceptional holiness, comes from later tradition and development within the Christian Church, rather than being directly indicated in the New Testament texts themselves. It's essential to remember that all Christians are considered saints, as they have been sanctified by God through the work of Christ on the cross and the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response as 80.

The main strength of this response is that it correctly identifies the biblical definition of saints as referring to believers in Jesus Christ, which aligns with the correct answer provided. The response also highlights an important distinction between cultural and scriptural interpretations, addressing the concern specified.

However, there are a few areas for improvement. Firstly, while the response mentions that the term "saints" literally means "holy ones", it could be more specific about what this term means in the context of the New Testament. The provided response doesn't explicitly state that all believers in Jesus Christ are considered saints, which is an important point to make.

Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer explanation of how cultural and scriptural interpretations differ. While it mentions the importance of distinguishing between these two, it would be helpful to provide more specific examples or illustrations to drive this point home.

Overall, while the response provides a good foundation for understanding the biblical definition of saints, it could be strengthened with additional details and examples to further address the concern specified.
