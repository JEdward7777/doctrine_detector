The response appropriately highlights that sanctification is a process of transformation into the image of Christ and underscores the role of God's grace and empowerment of the Holy Spirit in this process. The explanation is clear and doctrinally sound, focusing on the personal aspect of sanctification for believers' spiritual growth and transformation. Great job!"
