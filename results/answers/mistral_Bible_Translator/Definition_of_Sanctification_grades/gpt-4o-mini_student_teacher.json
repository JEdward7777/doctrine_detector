  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid understanding of the biblical concept of sanctification, emphasizing its meaning as being set apart for God's purposes and made holy. They also correctly highlighted the role of the Holy Spirit in the process of sanctification. The student's explanation was thorough and well-supported by relevant biblical references. However, there could have been a bit more depth in connecting the personal aspect of sanctification to the broader biblical perspective. Overall, a strong answer with room for a slight improvement in depth."
