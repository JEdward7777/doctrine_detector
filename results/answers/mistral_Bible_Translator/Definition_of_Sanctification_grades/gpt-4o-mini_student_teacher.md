## [Answer](../Definition_of_Sanctification.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the word "sanctify" or "be sanctified" refers to being set apart for God's purposes and made holy. This holiness is a reflection of God's nature and character, which is perfect, righteous, and morally pure.

Sanctification is a process that occurs in a believer's life through the work of the Holy Spirit. It involves a progressive transformation into the image of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18). This change is not due to personal effort or self-improvement, but rather it comes from God's grace and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit (Philippians 2:13).

Sanctification can also refer to the act of making something sacred or holy, such as setting apart a place for worship or dedicating oneself to God's service. However, in this response, I focused on the personal aspect of sanctification that pertains to the believer's spiritual growth and transformation.

Comment: The student provided a solid understanding of the biblical concept of sanctification, emphasizing its meaning as being set apart for God's purposes and made holy. They also correctly highlighted the role of the Holy Spirit in the process of sanctification. The student's explanation was thorough and well-supported by relevant biblical references. However, there could have been a bit more depth in connecting the personal aspect of sanctification to the broader biblical perspective. Overall, a strong answer with room for a slight improvement in depth.
