Understanding the biblical definition of sanctification.

# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the word "sanctify" or "be sanctified" refers to being set apart for God's purposes and made holy. This holiness is a reflection of God's nature and character, which is perfect, righteous, and morally pure.

Sanctification is a process that occurs in a believer's life through the work of the Holy Spirit. It involves a progressive transformation into the image of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18). This change is not due to personal effort or self-improvement, but rather it comes from God's grace and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit (Philippians 2:13).

Sanctification can also refer to the act of making something sacred or holy, such as setting apart a place for worship or dedicating oneself to God's service. However, in this response, I focused on the personal aspect of sanctification that pertains to the believer's spiritual growth and transformation.
