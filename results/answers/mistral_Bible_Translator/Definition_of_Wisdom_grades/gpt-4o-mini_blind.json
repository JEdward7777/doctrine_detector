The student effectively references relevant Scripture passages and conveys the deep understanding that wisdom is not merely intellectual knowledge but a divine attribute that encompasses reverence for God, virtuous living, and decision-making aligned with God's principles. The inclusion of the personification of wisdom in Proverbs adds depth to the explanation. Well done!"
