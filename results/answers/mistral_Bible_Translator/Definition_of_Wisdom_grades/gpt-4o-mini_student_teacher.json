  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as a 90.\n\nThe student has provided a well-rounded answer that aligns closely with the biblical concept of wisdom. They have correctly highlighted the importance of wisdom as a divine quality encompassing understanding, discernment, and righteousness, rooted in the fear of the LORD and the knowledge of the Holy One. The student also expands on the virtues associated with wisdom and the contrast with folly, providing a comprehensive understanding of wisdom as portrayed in the Bible.\n\nThe student effectively demonstrates an understanding of how wisdom is to be applied in daily life to honor God and make decisions in alignment with His will. The only slight deviation from the teacher's reference answer is the emphasis on the personification of wisdom as a woman in the Bible, which adds depth to the explanation.\n\nOverall, the student shows a strong grasp of the biblical definition of wisdom and its implications for Christian living."
