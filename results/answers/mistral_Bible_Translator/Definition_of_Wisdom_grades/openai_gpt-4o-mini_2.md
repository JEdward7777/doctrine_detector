## [Answer](../Definition_of_Wisdom.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the biblical definition, wisdom is not just knowledge or intelligence, but it is a divine quality that embodies understanding, discernment, and righteousness. It is the ability to apply God's truth and principles in daily life to live a godly and fruitful life.

Proverbs 9:10 says, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight." In this passage, wisdom begins with reverence for God, which leads to a deeper understanding of His ways.

Wisdom is also characterized by virtues such as prudence (discernment), justice (fairness), temperance (self-control), and courage (bravery). It is the capacity to make sound decisions that reflect God's will, lead to peace and prosperity, and bring glory to Him.

Furthermore, wisdom is often portrayed as a woman in the Bible, personifying the qualities of a virtuous life (Proverbs 1-9). She calls out to those who are wise and invites them to come and partake in her wisdom. In contrast, folly (ignorance, stupidity) is characterized by the opposite of these traits and leads to destruction (Proverbs 1:20-33).

Ultimately, Christian wisdom seeks to follow God's will and live a life that honors Him, recognizing that true wisdom comes from above and is a gift from God.
