## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Christian.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 A "Christian" in a biblical sense refers to a person who follows Jesus Christ and believes in His teachings as recorded in the New Testament of the Bible. The term "Christian" first appeared in Acts 11:26, where it was used to describe those who followed the way or teachings of Christ.

In a broader sense, a Christian is someone who acknowledges Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, accepts His sacrifice on the cross for the forgiveness of sins, and seeks to live according to God's will as revealed in the Bible. This belief system encompasses three essential beliefs or doctrines: faith in God the Father, faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the Savior of humanity, and faith in the Holy Spirit as the guide for believers.

It is important to note that being a Christian involves more than just professing belief; it requires active discipleship, obedience to God's commands, and growing in knowledge and love for God and others. As the Apostle Paul wrote in Philippians 1:27, "Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ..."

In summary, a Christian is someone who has accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, believes in His teachings, and seeks to live according to God's will as revealed in the Bible.
