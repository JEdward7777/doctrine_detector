## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Miracle.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, a miracle is an event attributed to the direct intervention of God in the natural world, which violates any known scientific laws. It's important to note that miracles are not considered as violations of the physical laws themselves, but rather as temporary suspensions or overriding by divine power.

Miracles serve as a demonstration of God's authority and sovereignty over creation. They demonstrate His omnipotence (all-powerful nature), His omniscience (all-knowing nature), and His benevolence (goodness). In the Bible, miracles are often used to authenticate the message or ministry of a prophet or messenger of God, such as Jesus Christ.

For example, in the Gospel accounts, Jesus performs many miracles, including turning water into wine at Cana (John 2:1-11), healing lepers (Luke 5:12-16), walking on water (Matthew 14:22-33), and raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-44). These miracles serve as evidence of Jesus' divine nature and authority, as well as His compassion and love for humanity.

Miracles in Christian theology are not simply magical tricks or displays of power, but rather they reveal God's relationship with His creation, His care for humanity, and His willingness to intervene in the affairs of people when necessary. They also serve as a reminder that our God is not confined by the limits of human understanding and ability, but is all-powerful and sovereign over all things.
