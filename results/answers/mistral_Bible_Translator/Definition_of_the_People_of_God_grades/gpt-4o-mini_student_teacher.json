  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of the People of God in both the Old and New Testaments. They accurately explained the covenantal relationship between God and Israel and connected it to the broader biblical narrative. However, the deviation from the provided reference answer regarding the focus solely on the nation of Israel slightly impacts the grade. Overall, the response is well-supported and insightful."
