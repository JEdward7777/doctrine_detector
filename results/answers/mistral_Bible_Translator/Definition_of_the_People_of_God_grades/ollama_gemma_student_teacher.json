They accurately explain that being considered one of the \"People of God\" refers to those in a covenantal relationship with Yahweh and specifically mention the Israelites after the covenant at Mount Sinai. The student also correctly highlights the requirements of this relationship, including worshipping Yahweh, observing the Mosaic law, and living a holy life. The inclusion of the connection to the New Testament and the concept of faith in Jesus Christ shows a broader understanding of the continuity of God's covenant throughout scripture."
