## [Answer](../Definition_of_the_People_of_God.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, being considered one of the "People of God" refers to those who were in a covenantal relationship with Yahweh (God). This term is often used to describe the Israelites, particularly after God chose them at Mount Sinai and established a covenant with them (Exodus 19-24).

The People of God are those who have entered into a sacred bond with God, promising to obey Him and follow His laws in exchange for His protection, guidance, and blessings. This relationship was characterized by worshipping only Yahweh, observing the Mosaic law, and living a life that reflects God's holiness and justice (Leviticus 19:2).

The New Testament continues this concept, as followers of Jesus Christ are also considered the People of God (1 Peter 2:9-10). They have been grafted in through faith in Jesus, continuing the covenantal relationship that began with Abraham and his descendants. The focus shifts from adherence to the Mosaic law to living out love for God and one another as a manifestation of the spirit of Christ.
