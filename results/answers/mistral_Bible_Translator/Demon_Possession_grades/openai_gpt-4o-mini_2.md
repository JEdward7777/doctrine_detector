## [Answer](../Demon_Possession.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the New Testament in the Bible, demon possession refers to an individual who has been taken over or controlled by a malevolent spirit or demons. This concept is often associated with mental illnesses, physical afflictions, and unusual behaviors.

The belief in demon possession can be found throughout the Gospels, most notably in the accounts of Jesus casting out demons from possessed individuals. In these stories, it is suggested that demons can inhabit a person, causing them to act against their will or reason, and bringing suffering or torment upon them.

It is important to note that the Bible does not provide a clear definition of demon possession, and interpretations vary among Christian denominations. Some view demon possession as a literal infestation by malevolent spirits, while others understand it metaphorically, representing spiritual oppression or sin in a person's life.

Ultimately, the biblical understanding of demon possession emphasizes that Jesus has authority over these spirits and can deliver individuals from their control through faith in Him and His power to heal.
