  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' within a Christian context, highlighting their distinct meanings and usage. However, the student's response could have been improved by directly referencing the teacher's defined meanings of each term to align more closely with a Christian worldview. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the differences between the terms, as well as their application in guiding believers according to scripture."
