  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a clear and concise definition of each term within a Christian theological context.\n* Offers relevant examples from scripture to support each definition.\n* Distinguishes between the distinct nuances of each term, highlighting their unique functions in guiding believers.\n* Recognizes the potential overlap between the terms but emphasizes their distinct purposes.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The answer lacks broader analysis or application of the terms beyond their definitions.\n* Does not delve into potential challenges or controversies surrounding the use of these terms in Christian communities.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* The student could expand on the role of these terms in various Christian practices, such as preaching, mentoring, or small group discussions.\n* Addressing potential ethical dilemmas or power dynamics associated with the use of exhortation, encouragement, and admonition would strengthen the response.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe student demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological concepts and offers a well-written response. However, expanding the analysis and addressing potential challenges would elevate the quality of the answer."
