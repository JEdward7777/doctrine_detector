  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise definition for each term, and it also attempts to clarify their nuances in a Christian context. The example verses from Scripture are helpful in illustrating how these terms can be applied in practice.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more detail on how these different forms of encouragement should be used according to Scripture. For example, while the response notes that exhortation is often used to call for obedience or commitment, it would have been helpful to discuss how this should be balanced with encouragement and admonition.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the terms \"exhort,\" \"encourage,\" and \"admonish\" in a Christian context, but could benefit from more development on how they should be applied in practice."
