  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish' in a Christian context, drawing on relevant scripture verses to support the distinctions between these terms. The response effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. The only potential improvement could have been to delve deeper into how scripture specifically guides the application of each form of encouragement in different situations. Overall, a well-crafted and insightful response."
