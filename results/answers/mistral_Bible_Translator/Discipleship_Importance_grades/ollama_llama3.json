  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament than the provided answer. The writer demonstrates an understanding that the apostles were chosen by Jesus for specific purposes, including representation, leadership, faith and obedience, character, and being witnesses to His ministry, death, and resurrection.\n\nThe response also provides biblical support for these points, which adds credibility to the argument. The only areas where the response could improve are:\n\n* Providing more clarity on how the apostles' characteristics and experiences made them uniquely qualified for their roles.\n* Delving deeper into the significance of the number 12 in the context of Israel's tribes.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a solid understanding of the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament."
