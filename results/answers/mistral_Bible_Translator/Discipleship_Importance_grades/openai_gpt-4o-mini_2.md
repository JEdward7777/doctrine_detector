## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The twelve apostles, also known as the Twelve Disciples or the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ, were chosen by Jesus for a specific purpose in His ministry on Earth. The Bible does not provide an exhaustive explanation as to why these specific individuals were selected, but there are several reasons that can be inferred from scripture:

1. Representation: The number 12 was symbolic of the twelve tribes of Israel, signifying that Jesus' message was for all the people of God (Matthew 19:28).

2. Leadership: The apostles were to be witnesses and teachers of Christ's message after His departure (Acts 1:8). They played a vital role in the early Church, spreading the gospel and establishing Christian communities.

3. Faith and obedience: Jesus called these men while they were engaged in their daily activities, often leaving behind their nets or tax collection booths to follow Him (Matthew 4:18-22; Luke 5:1-11). Their immediate response demonstrated their willingness to obey God's call and abandon worldly pursuits for a higher purpose.

4. Character: The apostles had various backgrounds, including fishermen, tax collectors, and a doctor, demonstrating that Jesus chose people from all walks of life to serve Him (Matthew 10:2-4). Their character flaws and strengths were not hidden but were part of their growth in faith and discipleship.

5. Witnesses to Jesus' ministry, death, and resurrection: The apostles saw and experienced the miracles, teachings, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, providing credibility to their testimonies about His life (John 15:26-27; Acts 1:22).

In summary, the selection of the twelve apostles was strategically important for Jesus' ministry as it represented all Israel, provided leadership for the early Church, demonstrated faith and obedience, showed that God calls people from diverse backgrounds, and established credible witnesses to Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
