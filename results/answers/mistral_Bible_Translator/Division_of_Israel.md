## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 After King Solomon's reign, the United Kingdom of Israel experienced a period of division into two kingdoms: The Northern Kingdom (also known as Israel or Ephraim) and the Southern Kingdom (also known as Judah). This event occurred around 930 BCE.

The division came about due to internal strife and disputes over religious practices, with the Northern Kingdom following more of Jeroboam's syncretistic religion and the Southern Kingdom maintaining a more faithful adherence to Yahwism. This event is often associated with the downfall of Israel as a unified nation and led to numerous conflicts and hardships for both kingdoms throughout their histories.

It is essential to note that this event is recorded in biblical texts, such as 1 Kings 12, and is also supported by archaeological and historical evidence. The division had profound theological implications for the people of Israel, as it marked a turning point in their relationship with God and set the stage for the subsequent events leading up to the Babylonian captivity and the restoration of Jerusalem under the Persian Empire.

In summary, the major event that occurred in Israel's history after King Solomon's reign was the division of the United Kingdom of Israel into two separate kingdoms: the Northern Kingdom (Israel or Ephraim) and the Southern Kingdom (Judah).
