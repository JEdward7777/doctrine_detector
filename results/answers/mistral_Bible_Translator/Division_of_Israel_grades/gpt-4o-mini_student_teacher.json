  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the division of Israel after King Solomon's reign, touching on key points such as the religious differences between the Northern and Southern Kingdoms, the historical context of the division, and the theological implications for the Israelites. They also referenced biblical texts and archaeological evidence to support their response. Overall, the student demonstrated a strong understanding of the historical and spiritual significance of the event. The slight deduction in grade is due to the extra details provided in the response beyond the specific concern, which could have been slightly more concise."
