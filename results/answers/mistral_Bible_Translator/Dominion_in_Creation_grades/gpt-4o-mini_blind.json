  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This response provides a solid overview of the biblical teachings on humanity's role in having dominion over the Earth. The student effectively references key passages from both the Old and New Testaments to support their points. The emphasis on stewardship, responsibility, and caring for God's creation is well articulated. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the fallen nature of humanity and the implications of sin on our stewardship role. Additionally, further elaboration on the theological basis for stewardship in Christian doctrine could have strengthened the response."
