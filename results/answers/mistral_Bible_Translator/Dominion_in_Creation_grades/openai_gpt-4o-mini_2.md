## [Answer](../Dominion_in_Creation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible teaches that humanity was created to have dominion over the Earth, according to Genesis 1:26-28. In this passage, God says, "Let Us make mankind in Our image, in Our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all creatures that move along the ground."

This dominion or stewardship is not just about ruling or controlling, but it includes caring for and managing the resources of the Earth responsibly. Humans were given the task of cultivating and keeping the garden (Genesis 2:15). The Bible also emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with God's creation and avoiding practices that exploit or harm it (Leviticus 25:2, Jeremiah 29:7, Luke 12:24).

In the New Testament, Jesus calls on his followers to love their neighbors (Mark 12:31) and extend this love even to animals (Matthew 25:40). He also warns against misusing or hoarding resources (Luke 12:16-21).

In summary, the Bible teaches that humans were created to have a role of stewardship over the Earth. This role involves caring for and managing resources responsibly while living in harmony with God's creation. It also calls on us to love and treat all creatures with kindness and respect.
