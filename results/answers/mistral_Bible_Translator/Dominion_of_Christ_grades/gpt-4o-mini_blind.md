 In the Bible, Jesus Christ's dominion is primarily described through His role as the Messiah (Savior) and the King of Kings. Here are a few examples:

1. As the Messiah, Jesus' dominion is spiritual rather than physical. The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:25-27, "For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. For 'God has put all things under his feet.' Now when it says that 'all things have been put under him,' it is clear that this does not include God himself, for 'he has put everything under Christ.'

2. In Revelation 19:16, it describes Jesus as follows: "On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS." This passage portrays Jesus as a universal and eternal King who rules over all other kings and lords.

3. Psalm 2:7-9 also speaks of the Messiah's dominion, saying, "I will proclaim the decree of the Lord: He said to me, 'You are my Son; today I have become your Father. Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. You will break them with a rod of iron; you will dash them to pieces like pottery.'" This passage describes Jesus as the rightful heir to an inheritance that includes all the nations, which He will rule over with authority.

4. In Matthew 28:18-20, Jesus gives the Great Commission to His disciples, saying in part, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me." This passage emphasizes Jesus' all-encompassing dominion, not only spiritually but also over every realm of human activity.

In summary, according to the Bible, Jesus Christ exercises a spiritual dominion as the Savior and King of Kings, ruling over all things and reigning until He has put all His enemies under His feet.
