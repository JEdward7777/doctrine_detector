The response clearly articulates the spiritual and universal nature of Christ's reign as the Messiah and King of Kings. The inclusion of specific verses and their interpretations strengthens the overall argument. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the impact of Jesus Christ's dominion on the lives of believers."
