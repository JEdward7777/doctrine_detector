It effectively addresses the concern of recognizing the authority of Christ in all aspects of life and how this impacts our faith. The only minor improvement could be to directly link the specific roles of prophet, priest, and king to the concept of dominion in the explanation. Overall, a well-supported and insightful perspective from a Christian worldview."
