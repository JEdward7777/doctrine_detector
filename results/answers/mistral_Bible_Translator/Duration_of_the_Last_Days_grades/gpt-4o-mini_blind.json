  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and accurate explanation of the concept of \"the last days\" in Christian theology, highlighting the uncertainty of its duration according to the Bible and emphasizing its spiritual significance rather than a specific time frame. The reference to Matthew 24:36 supports the explanation well. The answer could be enhanced by including additional scriptural references that discuss the characteristics and events associated with the last days. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
