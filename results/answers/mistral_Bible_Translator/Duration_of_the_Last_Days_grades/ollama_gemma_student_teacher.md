## [Answer](../Duration_of_the_Last_Days.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The concept of "the last days" in Christian theology refers to the eschatological period, which some interpret as starting with the first coming of Jesus Christ and culminating with His second coming or the end of the world. However, the Bible does not provide a specific time frame for the duration of the last days. Instead, it emphasizes that no one knows when these events will occur (Matthew 24:36). The term "last days" is used to denote a period of unprecedented spiritual significance and challenges rather than a specific length of time.
