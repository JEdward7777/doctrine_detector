  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately answers the question about the duration of \"the last days\" by stating that it is unknown, which aligns with the correct answer. Additionally, it provides some biblical support for this view by citing Matthew 24:36.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response does not fully address the concern about how Christians should live out their faith in anticipation of Christ's return due to this uncertainty. While it mentions that the Bible emphasizes the importance of spiritual significance and challenges during the last days, it could have explored more deeply how Christians can respond to this uncertainty and continue living out their faith with hope and urgency.\n\nOverall, I think the response is strong in terms of providing an accurate answer, but could be improved by further exploring the practical implications for Christian living."
