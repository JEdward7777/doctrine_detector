  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the concept of \"the last days\" in Christian theology, stating that the duration is unknown based on biblical references. The concern raised regarding how this uncertainty can impact Christians' faith and anticipation of Christ's return is valid and addresses a significant aspect of eschatological beliefs. Overall, this is a well-rounded response with a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
