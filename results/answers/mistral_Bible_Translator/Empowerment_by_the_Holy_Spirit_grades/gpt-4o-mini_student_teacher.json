  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing various ways in which the Holy Spirit empowers Christians according to Biblical references. The answer aligns well with the concerns of awareness and effectiveness in ministry and faith. However, the student could have tied back their response more directly to the reference answer provided by focusing on leading, teaching, comforting, and proclamation of the Gospel as key aspects of the Holy Spirit's empowerment. Additionally, the student could have emphasized the foundational aspects of empowerment that enable effective ministry and living out one's faith."
