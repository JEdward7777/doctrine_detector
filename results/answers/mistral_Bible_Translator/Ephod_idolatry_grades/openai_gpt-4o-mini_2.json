  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the danger of idolatry and the importance of focusing on God rather than material representations of faith. It provides a thorough analysis of the story of Gideon's golden ephod and offers relevant lessons based on a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the consequences of idolatry in terms of the relational aspect between God and His people."
