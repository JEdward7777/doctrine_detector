  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90 \n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed description of the materials used in the construction of the high priest's ephod, acknowledging the significance of each element mentioned in the Old Testament. The response effectively highlights the importance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The inclusion of the precious stones engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel further enhances the depth of the explanation. Great job overall, with only a minor detail missing in comparison to the reference answer."
