## [Answer](../Ephod_materials.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Old Testament, the ephod worn by the High Priest was made from two main materials. The body of the ephod was constructed out of linen, a natural fiber (Exodus 28:6). On this linen foundation, gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarns were skillfully worked in (verses 5-8). Additionally, precious stones engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were set into the breastplate that hung from the ephod (verse 15-21). This breastplate was also constructed from gold, as well as the two shoulder pieces connected to it. These intricate details demonstrate the significant symbolism and sacredness associated with the High Priest's attire in Jewish tradition.
