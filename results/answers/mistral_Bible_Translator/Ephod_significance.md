## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, the high priest's ephod held great symbolic and practical importance in Jewish worship. The ephod was a piece of clothing worn by the high priest during his ministerial duties (Exodus 28:6-14). It consisted of two main parts: the breastpiece (the "ephod proper") and the waistband.

The breastpiece, or Urim and Thummim, had twelve stones engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, set in four rows of three stones each. The Urim and Thummim were two small boxes attached to the breastpiece which were believed to contain divine wisdom (Exodus 28:30). Through this, God's will could be communicated to the high priest during important decisions or disputes (Leviticus 8:1; Numbers 27:21).

The ephod also had pomegranates and golden bells on the hem of the robe. The pomegranates signified God's promises to Israel, while the bells were meant to alert the community when the high priest entered or left the Holy Place (Numbers 4:26, 30).

In addition, the high priest's ephod served as a physical reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people. The intricate design, materials, and gemstones used in creating the ephod represented holiness, purity, and divine guidance for the Israelites (Exodus 28:2).

Overall, the high priest's ephod was an essential component of Jewish worship, symbolizing the connection between God and His people, as well as providing a means to seek divine wisdom and guidance.
