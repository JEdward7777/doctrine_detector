  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the significance of the high priest's ephod in Old Testament worship, including its symbolism and practical functions. They accurately described the components of the ephod and their purposes, such as the Urim and Thummim for discerning God's will and the pomegranates and bells for various symbolic purposes. The student effectively connected the ephod to the covenant relationship between God and His people. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the priestly mediation aspect of the ephod, as emphasized in the reference answer."
