It correctly emphasizes their coeternal, consubstantial nature and unity of essence while highlighting their distinct roles within the Trinity. The scriptural references further support the explanation. Additionally, the mention of \"perichoresis\" adds depth to the description of the Trinity as a divine mystery. Overall, a well-structured and doctrinally sound response."
