## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, the term "perishing" or "lost" often refers to those who do not accept Jesus Christ as their Savior and therefore spend eternity separated from God in a state known as hell. This belief is based on the teachings of the Bible.

For example, in John 3:16 it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." Similarly, in Matthew 25:46 it states, "Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."

It's important to note that the concept of hell is a deeply controversial and complex topic within Christianity. Many Christians interpret these passages literally, while others interpret them metaphorically or with more nuance. The specific beliefs about heaven, hell, and the afterlife can vary greatly among different Christian denominations and individual believers.

Ultimately, the eternal consequences for those who "perish" are a matter of interpretation and personal faith, and they can have profound emotional and philosophical implications. It's always recommended to discuss such topics with a trusted spiritual advisor or pastor for a more nuanced understanding.
