  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer regarding the eternal consequences for those described as 'perishing' in Christian theology. They referenced relevant Bible verses and acknowledged the diversity of interpretations within Christianity on the topic of hell. However, the student could strengthen their response by emphasizing the seriousness and gravity of eternal separation from God more explicitly in alignment with the concern provided."
