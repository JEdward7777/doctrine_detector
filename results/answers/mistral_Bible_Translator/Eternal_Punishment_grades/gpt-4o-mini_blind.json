However, the answer could be strengthened by emphasizing the foundational aspect of God's holiness and righteousness in relation to His justice. Additionally, the mention of potential restoration or universal reconciliation does not align with the traditional Christian understanding of eternal punishment in Hell as a result of rejecting God. Greater clarity and emphasis on the gravity of sin and the necessity of repentance and faith in Christ for salvation would enhance the response."
