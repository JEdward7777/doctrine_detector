  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provides a well-articulated and comprehensive answer discussing various aspects of God's justice in relation to the concept of eternal punishment in Hell. The answer reflects a strong understanding of Christian beliefs on love, mercy, and accountability. However, the concern mentioned in the teacher's answer, focusing on the direct consequence of not believing in Jesus' sacrifice and God's response to rebellion and rejection, is not clearly addressed in the student's response. The student's answer, though insightful and informative, lacks the direct biblical emphasis on the foundational aspect of salvation through belief in Jesus as the core reason for eternal punishment in Hell."
