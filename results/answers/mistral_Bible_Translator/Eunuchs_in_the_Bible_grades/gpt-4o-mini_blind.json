They correctly highlighted the spiritual aspect of celibacy and its voluntary nature in Christian theology. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the historical and cultural context of eunuchs in biblical times and a deeper analysis of celibacy within the broader Christian tradition. Overall, a well-articulated and doctrinally sound answer."
