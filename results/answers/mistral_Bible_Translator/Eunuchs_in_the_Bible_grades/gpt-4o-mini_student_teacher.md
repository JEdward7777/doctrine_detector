## [Answer](../Eunuchs_in_the_Bible.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Matthew 19:12, Jesus spoke about eunuchs "for the kingdom of heaven." This statement is not just referring to physical eunuchs but also includes those who choose celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom.

Jesus made a distinction between eunuchs who are born that way and those who have been made eunuchs by others (verse 12). The emphasis here is not on their physical condition but on their state of heart and mind. Jesus was referring to those who, for the sake of God's kingdom, choose to live a life of celibacy or abstain from marriage, as exemplified by Himself and some in the Old Testament (such as Jeremiah 16:2).

This passage does not mandate celibacy for all Christians but rather recognizes it as a valid choice and even a blessing for those who can live this way. The concept of celibacy, in Christian theology, is seen as a self-denial, a giving up of personal desires for the sake of following God more closely (Matthew 19:21). It's an expression of love for God and a dedication to serving Him wholeheartedly.

In the Catholic Church, celibacy is required for priests as it is believed to allow them to focus more fully on their ministry, imitating Christ's self-giving love. However, the decision to live in celibacy or marry remains a personal choice and discernment for individual Christians within various denominations.
