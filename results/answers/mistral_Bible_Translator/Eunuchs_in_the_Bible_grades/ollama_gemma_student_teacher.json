  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and eunuchs. The student clearly articulates the different categories of eunuchs mentioned by Jesus and emphasizes the spiritual significance of celibacy as a self-denial for the sake of following God. The response also provides relevant examples from both the Old and New Testaments and concludes with a thoughtful reflection on the personal choice of celibacy within different denominations."
