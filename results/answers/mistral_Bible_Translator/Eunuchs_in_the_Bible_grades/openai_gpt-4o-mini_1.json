  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical perspective on celibacy and the reasons for living a life without marriage. The incorporation of specific Bible verses, such as Matthew 19:12, and the explanation of celibacy as a valid choice in Christian theology, particularly within the Catholic Church, shows a deep understanding of the topic. The response effectively addresses the concern raised with clear explanations and references to relevant biblical teachings."
