  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and thoughtful response to the question, outlining practical ways to exalt God in daily life. They correctly identified key aspects such as praise, living according to biblical principles, seeking guidance, sharing the Gospel, serving others, stewardship, and loving others as foundational in exalting God. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the importance of exalting God above all else in life and provided practical examples to illustrate their points effectively. However, while their response was detailed and well-written, it slightly deviated from the reference answer by including additional elements beyond the core concept of highly praising and honoring God. Overall, the student's answer showed a strong grasp of the topic and its application to daily life from a Christian worldview."
