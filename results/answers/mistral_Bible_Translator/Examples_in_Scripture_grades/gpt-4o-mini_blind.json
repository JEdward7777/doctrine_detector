  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides accurate and detailed examples of demon possession accounts from the Bible. The student effectively highlights key points from each story and demonstrates an understanding of the spiritual significance behind these accounts. The answer could be enhanced by elaborating more on the significance of Jesus' authority over demons and the spiritual warfare aspect in a Christian worldview. Overall, a very well-done response."
