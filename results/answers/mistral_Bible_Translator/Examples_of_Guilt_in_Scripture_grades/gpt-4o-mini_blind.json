  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a comprehensive overview of various biblical examples demonstrating the concept of guilt. The student effectively connects each example to the concept of guilt, highlighting the consequences of sin and the struggle with one's conscience. The inclusion of the Parable of the Prodigal Son to emphasize God's mercy and forgiveness was a good addition. The response could have been further strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references to support each point and by delving deeper into the theological implications of guilt and redemption in the Christian faith."
