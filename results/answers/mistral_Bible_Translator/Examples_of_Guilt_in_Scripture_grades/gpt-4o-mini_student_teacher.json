  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student provided well-explained examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt, showcasing different scenarios where individuals experienced guilt in their actions and relationship with God. Each example was detailed and connected back to the concept of guilt. However, the answer did not directly address the concern provided, which was to help understand how guilt operates in the context of justice and innocence, pointing to the need for divine judgment. The examples given by the student did not explicitly tie in the aspect of justice, innocence, and divine judgment in relation to guilt, as requested in the concern. Despite this, the content of the response was thorough and demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of guilt in the context of biblical narratives."
