1. Adam and Eve's Expulsion from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:7-24): The story of Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit can be seen as an example of guilt. After eating the fruit, they realized they were naked and sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves. God called out to Adam asking what he had done, and Adam admitted to disobeying God's command. Their actions demonstrated a sense of guilt by hiding from God and seeking to cover their own shame.

2. Cain and Abel's Sacrifices (Genesis 4:1-16): In this story, Cain and Abel brought offerings to the Lord. Although the Lord accepted Abel's offering but not Cain's, the Bible does not explicitly state why that was the case. However, when God asked Cain about his brother Abel's whereabouts, Cain responded with anger and eventually killed his brother. His actions show a sense of guilt as he lies to God (Genesis 4:9) and is cursed by Him (Genesis 4:12).

3. King David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11): In this narrative, King David lusted after Bathsheba, the wife of one of his soldiers, Uriah. When she became pregnant with David's child, he attempted to cover up his adultery by having Uriah killed in battle. After Nathan the prophet confronted him with this sin, David confessed and expressed guilt (2 Samuel 12:13).

4. Peter's Denial of Jesus (Matthew 26:69-75): In the story of Peter's denial of Christ, Peter swore to follow Jesus even if everyone else abandoned Him. However, after Jesus was arrested and taken away, Peter denied knowing Him three times, demonstrating a sense of guilt.

5. The Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:11-32): In this parable, the younger son asks his father for his share of the inheritance and squanders it on a life of excess. When he returns home in guilt and shame, his father welcomes him back, demonstrating God's mercy towards repentant sinners.

These examples showcase different ways that guilt is manifested in human actions, either through direct consequences or through the internal struggle with one's own conscience and relationship with God. The Bible also teaches that forgiveness and redemption are available to those who repent of their sins (1 John 1:9).
