It effectively addresses the concern raised by highlighting the examples provided and connecting them to the need for divine judgment. The integration of the additional example about Pilate declaring Jesus innocent adds depth to the overall argument. Overall, a strong and comprehensive treatment of the topic from a Christian worldview."
