  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 80.\n\nThe student's answer effectively highlights the importance of faith in Abram's life and the significance of active trust, commitment, and obedience in receiving and trusting God's promises. However, the student's explanation could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern provided. While the answer is well-written and insightful, some additional clarity and direct connection to the concern would have further strengthened the response."
