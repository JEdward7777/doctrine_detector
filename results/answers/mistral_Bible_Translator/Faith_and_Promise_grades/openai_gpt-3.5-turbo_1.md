# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Biblical account of Abram (later renamed Abraham), faith plays a crucial role in his reception and trust of the promises made by God. The story is found in Genesis 15:6, which says, "And he believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness."

The concept here is that Abram's faith was not only the means by which he received God's promise but also the basis on which God credited or imputed righteousness to Abram. This idea is further developed in the New Testament, particularly in Romans 4:3, where the apostle Paul writes, "For what does the Scripture say? 'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness.'"

In this sense, faith is not simply passive assent or intellectual agreement with a set of beliefs. It involves trust, commitment, and obedience. Abram demonstrated his faith in various ways, including his willingness to leave his homeland, his family, and his comfort zone to follow God's call (Genesis 12:1-4).

Moreover, throughout the story of Abram, he faced numerous challenges and uncertainties. Yet, despite these trials, he continued to trust in God's promises. This persistence in faith is a testament to his reliance on God and his belief that He would keep His word.

In summary, faith plays an essential role in receiving and trusting the promises of God as seen in Abram's example. It involves active trust, commitment, and obedience to God, even in the face of challenges and uncertainties. This demonstrates reliance on God and belief that He will fulfill His promises.
