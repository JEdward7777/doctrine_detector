The mention of Jesus' teachings and sacrificial love as described in the New Testament is also a significant aspect of this concept. However, the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation, especially in terms of the personal implications for believers.\n\nSome areas that are not fully addressed include the emphasis on Jesus being both fully human and fully divine, which is an important aspect of Christian theology. Additionally, the response does not explore the depth of what it means to \"live according to His example\" or how this belief impacts one's daily life as a believer. Nevertheless, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the core message of the Gospel and its personal implications for believers."
