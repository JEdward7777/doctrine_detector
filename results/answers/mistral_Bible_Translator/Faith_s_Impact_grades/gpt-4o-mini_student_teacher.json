  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer detailing various aspects of how true faith in Jesus manifests in a person's life according to Christian theology. The answer covers a wide range of behaviors and attitudes that align with biblical teachings. However, the concern specifically focused on recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life, and while the student's response does touch on daily life manifestations, it may be seen as overly theoretical rather than practical. Despite this, the student's answer demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic and provides valuable insights."
