  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of favoritism in a biblical context, supported by relevant scripture references. The student effectively articulates how favoritism can harm relationships and offers a solid explanation of the Christian perspective on how to treat others. The response could benefit from further elaboration on the redemptive aspect of forgiveness and reconciliation in the context of overcoming favoritism, but overall, it demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
