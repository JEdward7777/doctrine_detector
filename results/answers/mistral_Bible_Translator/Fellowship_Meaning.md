 In a Christian context, the term "fellowship" (also known as koinonia in Greek) often refers to the communal relationship shared among believers through their common faith in Jesus Christ. This relationship is characterized by love, unity, mutual support, and sharing in both spiritual and practical aspects of life. Fellowship implies a sense of belonging to the same body of Christ and participating together in worship, service, and growth. It's also used to describe gathering together for prayer, teaching, breaking bread (communion), and various forms of shared activities that strengthen the bond between believers. Essentially, Christian fellowship is about fostering a deep sense of connection and love within the church community.
