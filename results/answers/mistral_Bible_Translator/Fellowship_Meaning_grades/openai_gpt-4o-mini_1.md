 In a Christian context, the term "fellowship" (also known as koinonia in Greek) often refers to the communal relationship shared among believers through their common faith in Jesus Christ. This relationship is characterized by love, unity, mutual support, and sharing in both spiritual and practical aspects of life. Fellowship implies a sense of belonging to the same body of Christ and participating together in worship, service, and growth.
