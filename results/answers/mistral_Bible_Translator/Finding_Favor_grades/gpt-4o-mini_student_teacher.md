## [Answer](../Finding_Favor.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a biblical context, "finding favor" refers to gaining approval, pleasure, or goodwill from someone, especially God. It's often used to describe the relationship between individuals and God, as well as within human relationships. For example, in Genesis 6:8, it says that "Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD." This means that God looked upon Noah with approval and favor because of his righteousness compared to the wickedness of humanity at that time. The concept is also present in human relationships, such as in Proverbs 3:1 where it says, "My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity." Here, the father's commands are something his son should follow to find favor with him.
