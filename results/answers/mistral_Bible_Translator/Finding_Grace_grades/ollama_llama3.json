  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately defines \"finding grace in the eyes of God\" as receiving divine favor, mercy, and love, which aligns with Christian theology. It also correctly states that this grace is not earned or deserved but is a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ. The mention of salvation and forgiveness of sins adds context to the concept of finding grace.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more depth and exploration on how one can seek and recognize God's favor in their life, which was the concern. While it touches on the idea that God is pleased with those who believe in Jesus Christ, it would have been beneficial to include specific examples or biblical passages that demonstrate how to cultivate a relationship with God.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the concept of finding grace in the eyes of God but could benefit from further development and application."
