It also correctly highlights that this grace is not earned but is a gift through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the response could have further expanded on how individuals can actively seek and recognize God's favor in their lives, perhaps by mentioning practices such as prayer, reading Scripture, and living in alignment with God's will."
