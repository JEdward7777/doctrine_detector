## [Answer](../Finding_Grace.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, finding grace in the eyes of God refers to receiving divine favor, mercy, and love. This grace is not something we earn or deserve, but a gift from God that comes through faith in Jesus Christ. It is often associated with salvation and the forgiveness of sins, as well as the ability to live a life pleasing to God. The ultimate source of this grace is God himself, and it is offered freely to all who believe in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior (John 3:16).
