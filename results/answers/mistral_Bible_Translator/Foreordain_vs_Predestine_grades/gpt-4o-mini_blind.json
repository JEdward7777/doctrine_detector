They appropriately distinguish the nuances of each term and how they relate to God's plan and human free will. The explanation is doctrinally sound and demonstrates a good understanding of the theological concepts. However, the mention of varying interpretations among different Christian denominations and theologians could be expanded upon to provide more depth and clarity."
