  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough explanation of the concepts of predestination and foreordination in Christian theology, highlighting the distinctions between the two terms effectively. The response shows a good understanding of the theological implications of each term. The explanation could be improved by focusing more specifically on the relationship between foreordain and predestine, as well as incorporating the teacher's reference answer more directly."
