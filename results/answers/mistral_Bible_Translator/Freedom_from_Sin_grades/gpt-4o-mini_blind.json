  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 90. \n\nThe answer effectively explains the ways in which being 'bound' by sin hinders a Christian's relationship with God, citing relevant Scripture verses. It also provides a solid foundation for finding freedom from those bonds through repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, sanctification, fellowship with believers, and prayer/study of God's Word. \n\nHowever, to improve the answer, the student could further emphasize the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering Christians to overcome sin and grow in holiness (Galatians 5:16-25). Additionally, highlighting the importance of ongoing confession and repentance in the Christian walk would enhance the completeness of the response."
