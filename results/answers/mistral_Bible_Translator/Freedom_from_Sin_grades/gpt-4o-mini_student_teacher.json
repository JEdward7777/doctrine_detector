  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer addressing the ways in which being 'bound' by sin can hinder a Christian's relationship with God, as well as practical steps to find freedom from these bonds. The biblical references and incorporation of key Christian principles such as repentance, faith in Jesus, sanctification, fellowship with believers, and prayer/study of God's Word were well-executed. The answer effectively aligns with the concern of encouraging believers to address sin for a deeper relationship with God. However, to improve further, the student could have made the conclusion more concise and directly tied it back to the specific concern provided."
