  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is an excellent response that clearly articulates the ways in which sin can hinder a Christian's relationship with God. The student provides insightful explanations of how sin creates separation, spiritual blindness, loss of peace, and hinders the ability to please God. The proposed solutions of repentance, faith in Jesus Christ, sanctification, fellowship with believers, and prayer/study of God's Word are comprehensive and well-supported by scripture. Overall, this response demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian theology and its application in practical living."
