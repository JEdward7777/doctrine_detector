## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 As a Christian Bible translator, I can tell you that in the book of Galatians, chapter 5, verses 22-23, it is written: "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law." These qualities are often referred to as the fruits of the Holy Spirit, and a wise person should strive to exhibit these virtues in their daily lives as they are guided by the Spirit. Each fruit represents a different aspect of godliness and love that characterizes a life lived in accord with God's will.
