## Question [Fruits of Wisdom](../../../questions/Fruits_of_Wisdom.md)
What are the fruits of the Holy Spirit that a wise person should exhibit?

## Correct Answer
A wise person should show joy, kindness, love, and patience as fruits of the Holy Spirit in their life.

## Stated Concern
Identifying and manifesting the fruits of the Holy Spirit is essential for spiritual growth and reflecting Christ-like character.

## [Answer](../Fruits_of_Wisdom.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 As a Christian Bible translator, I can tell you that in the book of Galatians, chapter 5, verses 22-23, it is written: "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law." These qualities are often referred to as the fruits of the Holy Spirit, and a wise person should strive to exhibit these virtues in their daily lives as they are guided by the Spirit. Each fruit represents a different aspect of godliness and love that characterizes a life lived in accord with God's will.
