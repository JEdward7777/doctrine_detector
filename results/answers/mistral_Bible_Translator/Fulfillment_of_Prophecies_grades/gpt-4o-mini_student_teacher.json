  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. The student demonstrates a good understanding of different ways prophecies can be fulfilled according to Biblical teaching, including literal, spiritual, and progressive fulfillments. They also highlight the importance of studying the context and historical background for interpretation. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly emphasizing that ultimately, it is God who brings about the fulfillment of prophecies as stated in the reference answer."
