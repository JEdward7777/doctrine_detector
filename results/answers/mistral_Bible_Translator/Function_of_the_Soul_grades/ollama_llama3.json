  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response exceeds the minimum requirements for acknowledging the figurative language surrounding 'soul' by delving deeper into its biblical significance and multifaceted nature. It provides a comprehensive overview of the soul, discussing its spiritual, emotional, and intellectual aspects, and how these dimensions intersect to form human identity. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points and highlights the importance of understanding the soul from a biblical perspective.\n\nThe only areas for improvement would be to provide more specific biblical references to support the discussion (some are provided, but more could be added) and to elaborate on how this understanding of the soul can inform Christian living and discipleship. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a clear grasp of the figurative language surrounding 'soul' and its implications for human experience from a biblical perspective."
