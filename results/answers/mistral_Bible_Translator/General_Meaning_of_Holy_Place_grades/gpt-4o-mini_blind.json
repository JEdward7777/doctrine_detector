  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-supported and comprehensive explanation of the term \"holy place\" beyond the tabernacle or temple, incorporating various scriptural references from both the Old and New Testaments. The answer aligns with Christian beliefs regarding God's presence being manifested in different locations and individuals. The only improvement could be to include more direct references from Scripture to support certain points further."
