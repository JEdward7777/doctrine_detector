  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful response to the question, discussing various locations and their significance in experiencing God's presence beyond the traditional tabernacle or temple. The answer effectively incorporates Biblical references to support their points and offers a broad understanding of 'holy places' in both the Old and New Testaments. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of places set apart for God's worship and sacredness to align more closely with the teacher's specific concern."
