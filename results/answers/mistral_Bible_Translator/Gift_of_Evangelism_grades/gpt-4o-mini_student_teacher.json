  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained response that aligns with a Christian worldview. They have clearly outlined the distinctions between evangelists and other Christians, highlighting key points such as focus, spiritual gift, preaching and teaching abilities, motivation, calling, and biblical examples. This response effectively addresses the concern regarding the understanding of spiritual gifts related to evangelism and their role in the church. However, the only minor deduction is for the additional details provided beyond the reference answer, which slightly deviates from the simplicity and conciseness of the teacher's answer."
