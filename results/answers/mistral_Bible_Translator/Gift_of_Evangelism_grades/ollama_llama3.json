  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise explanation of what sets evangelists apart from other Christians, including their focus on sharing the Gospel, spiritual gift of evangelism, preaching and teaching abilities, motivation, and calling. The examples provided in Scripture also help to illustrate these points.\n\nHowever, I would like to see more emphasis on the role that evangelists play within the church. While the response does mention that evangelists may feel a divinely-given calling to proclaim the Gospel, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of how they contribute to the body of Christ as a whole. Nevertheless, the response is well-organized and effectively addresses the concern about understanding spiritual gifts related to evangelism."
