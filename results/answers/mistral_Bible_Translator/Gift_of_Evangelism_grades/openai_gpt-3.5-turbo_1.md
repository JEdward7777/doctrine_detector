## [Answer](../Gift_of_Evangelism.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christianity, all believers share the common goal of spreading the Gospel (the good news of Jesus Christ) and growing in their faith. However, the term "evangelist" is specifically used in the New Testament to refer to individuals who have a special role in this mission. Here are some key differences that set evangelists apart from other Christians:

1. Focus: Evangelists have a primary focus on sharing the Gospel with unbelievers, while other believers may also share their faith but may not necessarily prioritize it as much or to the same extent.
2. Spiritual Gift: An evangelist is often understood to possess the spiritual gift of evangelism, which is the ability to effectively communicate the Gospel and persuade others to accept Jesus Christ (Romans 12:6-8; Ephesians 4:11). This gift is given by God for the benefit of the Church.
3. Preaching and Teaching: Evangelists are known for their preaching and teaching abilities, especially in sharing the Gospel message. They are skilled at explaining the plan of salvation and making it understandable to those who may not yet know Jesus.
4. Motivation: An evangelist is motivated by a deep passion for God and a strong desire to see others come to know Him. This motivation drives their efforts in sharing the Gospel with others.
5. Calling: While all Christians are called to be witnesses of Christ, an evangelist may feel a specific, divinely-given calling to proclaim the Gospel to those outside the Church.
6. Examples in Scripture: Some examples of evangelists in the New Testament include Philip (Acts 8), Paul (Acts 20:24), and Peter (Acts 11:19). These individuals were instrumental in spreading the message of Christ to new regions and people groups.

In summary, while all Christians share a common faith and a desire to grow in their relationship with God, evangelists are those who have a specific focus on sharing the Gospel, possess the spiritual gift of evangelism, are skilled at preaching and teaching, are motivated by a passion for God, and may feel a divinely-given calling to proclaim the Gospel.
