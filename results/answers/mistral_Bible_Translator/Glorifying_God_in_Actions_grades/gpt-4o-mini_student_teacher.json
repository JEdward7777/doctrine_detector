  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive list of ways a believer can actively glorify God in their daily life, incorporating Biblical principles and practices. Each point is supported with relevant Bible verses, showing a strong foundation in Scripture. However, the reference answer emphasizes sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments as primary ways to glorify God, which the student's response does not entirely align with. Overall, the student's answer showcases a solid understanding of how to honor God's greatness in daily life."
