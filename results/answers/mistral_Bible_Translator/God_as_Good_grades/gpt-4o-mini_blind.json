  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of Jesus' statement about God being the only one who is good. They accurately highlight God's moral perfection and the contrast between God's goodness and human sinfulness. The student effectively connects this teaching to the broader biblical context and the need for a Savior. However, there is room for improvement in directly referencing the specific passages where Jesus refers to God as \"good\" and in providing more scriptural support for the points made. Overall, a strong understanding of the concept is demonstrated."
