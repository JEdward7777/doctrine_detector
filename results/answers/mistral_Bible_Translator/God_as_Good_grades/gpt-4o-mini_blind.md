## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, Jesus often refers to God as "good" (Matthew 19:17, Mark 10:18, Luke 18:19). The statement you provided, "There is only one who is good, and that is God," is not a direct quote from the Bible but a summary of Jesus' teachings on the nature of God.

When Jesus says there is only one who is good, He affirms the absolute moral perfection of God. In other words, God's goodness sets the standard for all morality and righteousness in the universe. No human being can claim to be morally perfect or truly good in comparison to an infinitely good God.

This statement also highlights the contrast between God and sinful humanity. As the apostle Paul wrote in Romans 3:10-12, "There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one."

In summary, Jesus' statement that only God is good emphasizes God's moral perfection and contrasts it with the sinful nature of humanity. It serves as a reminder of our need for a Savior and the importance of seeking a relationship with Him.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student has provided a solid explanation of Jesus' statement about God being the only one who is good. They accurately highlight God's moral perfection and the contrast between God's goodness and human sinfulness. The student effectively connects this teaching to the broader biblical context and the need for a Savior. However, there is room for improvement in directly referencing the specific passages where Jesus refers to God as "good" and in providing more scriptural support for the points made. Overall, a strong understanding of the concept is demonstrated.
