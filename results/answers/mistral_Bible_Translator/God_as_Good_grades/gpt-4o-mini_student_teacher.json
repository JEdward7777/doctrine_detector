  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a strong understanding of the concept of God's moral perfection and how it contrasts with the sinful nature of humanity. They effectively connect Jesus' statement to the larger biblical context and the need for a Savior. The only improvement could be to directly state the emphasis on God's moral perfection and righteousness as the ultimate standard of goodness, as specified in the reference answer. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful response from a Christian worldview perspective."
