  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response thoroughly addresses the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs by highlighting Jesus' statement that only God is good. It effectively explains how this statement emphasizes God's moral perfection, which serves as the ultimate standard for goodness. The response also accurately contrasts human nature with God's goodness, emphasizing the need for a Savior.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly tied the concept of God's goodness to our actions and beliefs, making it clearer how recognizing God as the source of goodness impacts our daily lives. Nonetheless, the response provides a strong biblical foundation for understanding the nature of God's goodness and its implications for humanity.\n\nComment: This response effectively answers the concern by showcasing Jesus' statement as a reminder of God's moral perfection and highlighting the need for humans to seek a relationship with Him. However, it could benefit from more explicit connections between God's goodness and our daily lives."
