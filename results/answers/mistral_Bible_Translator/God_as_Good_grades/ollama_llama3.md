## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, Jesus often refers to God as "good" (Matthew 19:17, Mark 10:18, Luke 18:19). The statement you provided, "There is only one who is good, and that is God," is not a direct quote from the Bible but a summary of Jesus' teachings on the nature of God.

When Jesus says there is only one who is good, He affirms the absolute moral perfection of God. In other words, God's goodness sets the standard for all morality and righteousness in the universe. No human being can claim to be morally perfect or truly good in comparison to an infinitely good God.

This statement also highlights the contrast between God and sinful humanity. As the apostle Paul wrote in Romans 3:10-12, "There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one."

In summary, Jesus' statement that only God is good emphasizes God's moral perfection and contrasts it with the sinful nature of humanity. It serves as a reminder of our need for a Savior and the importance of seeking a relationship with Him.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
95.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

The response thoroughly addresses the concern of recognizing the source of goodness in our actions and beliefs by highlighting Jesus' statement that only God is good. It effectively explains how this statement emphasizes God's moral perfection, which serves as the ultimate standard for goodness. The response also accurately contrasts human nature with God's goodness, emphasizing the need for a Savior.

The only area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly tied the concept of God's goodness to our actions and beliefs, making it clearer how recognizing God as the source of goodness impacts our daily lives. Nonetheless, the response provides a strong biblical foundation for understanding the nature of God's goodness and its implications for humanity.

Comment: This response effectively answers the concern by showcasing Jesus' statement as a reminder of God's moral perfection and highlighting the need for humans to seek a relationship with Him. However, it could benefit from more explicit connections between God's goodness and our daily lives.
