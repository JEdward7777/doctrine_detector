  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively explains the Christian perspective on the moral perfection and righteousness of God as the ultimate standard of goodness. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of Jesus' teachings and how they relate to human nature and the need for a Savior. The only reason for not giving a perfect score is the slight lack of depth in discussing how Christians should practically apply this understanding to recognize the source of goodness in their actions and beliefs. Overall, a strong and insightful analysis."
