  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and coherent explanation of the concept of a remnant in relation to God's selective grace towards His people, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament. The student effectively connects the idea of the remnant to God's sovereignty and emphasizes the role of grace in salvation. The response is well-supported with relevant biblical references and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. Great job overall!"
