  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that effectively demonstrates an understanding of how the concept of a remnant showcases God's selective grace towards His people. The student has integrated relevant biblical references and explained the significance of being chosen by God in both the Old and New Testaments. Additionally, the response aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing salvation as a gift from God based on His grace and not human merit. The only point of improvement would be to directly mirror the reference answer's concise statement in the conclusion to further demonstrate clarity and conciseness."
