## [Answer](../God_s_Chosen_People.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The concept of a remnant in the Bible indicates God's sovereign and selective grace towards His people, particularly within the context of Israel in the Old Testament and the Church in the New Testament.

In the Old Testament, the term "remnant" often refers to a small group of faithful individuals who remain loyal to God amidst a larger population that has turned away from Him. Despite the nation of Israel's frequent disobedience, God always chose to preserve a remnant, as promised through prophets like Isaiah (Isaiah 1:9) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 23:3). This chosen few were set apart for God's purpose, demonstrating His grace in choosing and preserving those who truly follow Him.

In the New Testament, the remnant is seen in the context of the Church, which emerged from the faithful followers of Jesus Christ. Despite humanity's sinful nature, God chose to call a people out for Himself (Ephesians 1:4). This election, or choosing, was not based on human merit but solely on God's grace and mercy (Romans 9:16).

The idea of the remnant thus showcases God's selective grace towards His people. It highlights that salvation is a gift from God, extended to those who put their faith in Him, as opposed to being something that can be earned or deserved by human effort (Ephesians 2:8-9). In this sense, the remnant concept underscores the sovereignty of God and emphasizes His unfathomable love and grace.
