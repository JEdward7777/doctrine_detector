  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the remnant in both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing God's sovereign and selective grace. It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of being chosen by God and how it is a demonstration of His grace rather than something earned by human effort. The explanation is coherent, supported by relevant biblical references, and aligns well with a Christian worldview. Great job overall!"
