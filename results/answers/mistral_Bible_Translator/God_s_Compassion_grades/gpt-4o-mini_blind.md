## [Answer](../God_s_Compassion.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, God's nature is described as being abundantly compassionate towards humanity. One of the most well-known verses that encapsulates this aspect of God's character can be found in Jeremiah 31:3 (NIV): "I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with loving-kindness."

   In addition, the books of Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Nehemiah highlight the importance of showing compassion to the vulnerable and marginalized in society. For example, in Leviticus 19:18 (NIV), it says "Love your neighbor as yourself" which is often considered a summary of the entire law.

   Moreover, Jesus Christ, who is God incarnate according to Christian belief, repeatedly showed compassion throughout the Gospels by healing the sick, feeding the hungry, and showing mercy to sinners. In Matthew 9:36 (NIV), it says that "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd."

   These passages, among others, demonstrate the importance of compassion as an aspect of God's nature and as a call to action for believers.
