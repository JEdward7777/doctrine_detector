  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student effectively explains how being \"called by my name\" reflects a deep and intimate relationship with God by highlighting the personal connection, covenantal bond, and specific purpose that God has for individuals. They also emphasize the reciprocal nature of the relationship, where individuals are called to respond in faith and obedience. The student's answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, showcasing a clear understanding of the implications of identity and belonging to God in a Christian's life.\n\nOverall, the student's response is coherent, well-supported with scriptural references, and offers a nuanced explanation of the concept in question."
