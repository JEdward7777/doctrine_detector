## [Answer](../God_s_Identity_Through_Naming.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The concept of being "called by my name" in the context of the Bible reflects a deep and intimate relationship between God and His people. It signifies that God knows each individual personally, not just as part of a crowd or a collective, but as unique beings created in His image.

When God calls someone by their name, it suggests a personal connection and a covenantal bond. It implies that He has a specific purpose for them (Jeremiah 1:5), and they belong to Him. This relationship is characterized by intimacy, love, and commitment. It's not a one-way relationship; individuals called by God are also expected to respond in faith, obedience, and worship.

In essence, being "called by my name" reflects the idea that our relationship with God is personal, intentional, and purposeful. It emphasizes that we are known and loved by God on an individual level, and we are called to respond to that love in a way that brings glory to Him.
