  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a well-rounded explanation of the significance of God's calling, incorporating key theological principles such as God's sovereignty, divine purpose, human response and obedience, relationship building, and spiritual growth. The answer effectively articulates the biblical implications of God's intentional calling and its implications for believers. Great job overall, but could be strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references to support the points made."
