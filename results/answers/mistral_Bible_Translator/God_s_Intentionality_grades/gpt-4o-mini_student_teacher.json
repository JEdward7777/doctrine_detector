  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of God's intentional calling in a biblical context. They effectively highlighted key points such as God's sovereignty, divine purpose, the importance of response and obedience, relationship building, and spiritual growth. The response demonstrated a strong understanding of the concept, but could have been strengthened by directly tying each point back to the intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity, as highlighted in the reference answer."
