## [Answer](../God_s_Jealousy.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The word "jealous" in the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, doesn't carry the same connotations as it does in everyday language today. In this context, the term "jealous" (Hebrew: qanas; Greek: zelos) often refers to a passionate and protective love. God is described as being "jealous" for His people because He loves them deeply and desires an exclusive relationship with them. This jealousy is not self-centered or envious, but rather a deep concern that His people would not turn away from Him and seek other gods. It emphasizes the importance of faithfulness in the covenant relationship between God and humanity. In essence, when God says He is "jealous," it expresses a profound love for His people and a desire to maintain that relationship without any rivalry or distractions.
