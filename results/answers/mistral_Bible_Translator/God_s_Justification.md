## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, justification refers to the act of God declaring sinners righteous, or counting them as if they were righteous based on faith in Jesus Christ. This concept is a central theme in the Bible, particularly in the books of Romans (3:21-26) and Galatians (2:16), among others.

Justification entails several key elements:

1. God's Righteousness: God's righteousness is imputed or credited to the believer, meaning that His perfect righteousness is given to us. This righteousness is not something we can earn or achieve but is a gift received by faith. (Romans 3:22)

2. Faith in Jesus Christ: Justification is always a work of God's grace and is received through faith in Jesus Christ. Faith is not merely an intellectual assent to certain truths, but a trust and reliance upon Jesus for salvation. (Ephesians 2:8-9)

3. Forgiveness of Sins: When God justifies us, He forgives our sins. This means that the penalty for our sins, which is death, has been paid by Jesus on the cross, and we are no longer under the judgment and condemnation of sin. (Romans 4:7-8)

4. A New Relationship with God: Justification also results in a new relationship with God, where we are adopted as children of God, and we can now approach Him with confidence and boldness. (Galatians 3:26-27)

5. Sanctification: While justification is a one-time event occurring at the moment of faith, it also marks the beginning of a process of sanctification, whereby God progressively transforms us into the image of Christ in our lives. (Romans 8:29-30)
