## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The name "Yahweh" is one of the most significant names for God in the Hebrew Bible, often referred to as the Old Testament in Christianity. It appears more than 6,800 times in the Hebrew text, representing the central and unique aspect of Israel's faith.

The name Yahweh comes from the Hebrew verb "Hayah," which means "to be" or "to exist." However, when used as a noun, it signifies the self-existent one, the eternal God. This name emphasizes God's self-revelation to Israel and His relationship with them.

In Exodus 3:14, God revealed His name to Moses as "Yahweh" (יְהוָ֫ה, YHWH) when He said, "I AM WHO I AM." This name serves as a reminder of God's unchanging nature and His promise to be with His people throughout their history.

The significance of the name Yahweh lies in its expression of the unique covenantal relationship between God and Israel, as well as its emphasis on God's self-revelation, faithfulness, and eternal existence.
