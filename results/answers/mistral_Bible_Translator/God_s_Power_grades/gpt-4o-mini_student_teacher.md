## [Answer](../God_s_Power.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The term "Almighty" in Christian theology signifies that God possesses omnipotence, which means He has unlimited power and can do anything consistent with His perfect nature. This includes the power to create the universe, sustain it, and work miracles. However, it's important to note that the concept of omnipotence also implies that God cannot contradict Himself or act against His own nature. For example, He cannot make a rock so heavy that even He cannot lift it, as this would imply a limitation on His power. The term "Almighty" reflects God's supreme authority and sovereignty over all things in the universe.
