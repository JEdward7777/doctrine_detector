  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer with relevant Bible verses and principles to guide believers in discerning God's plan. However, there was an excessive focus on specific verses and principles without emphasizing the importance of seeking counsel from mature Christians or observing circumstances and opportunities as mentioned in the reference answer. Encouraging the student to incorporate these additional aspects would enhance their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
