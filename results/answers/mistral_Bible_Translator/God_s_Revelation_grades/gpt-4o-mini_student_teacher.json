  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of various names of God in the Bible and their significance, the answer did not focus specifically on how God introduces Himself using His name to reveal His identity and the covenant relationship with His people. The student did touch upon these aspects, but the explanation could have been more focused on the specific question asked. However, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the names of God and their meanings in the Bible. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in addressing the specific concern raised in the question."
