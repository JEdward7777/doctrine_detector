It also mentions the titles of God in the New Testament and acknowledges the limitations of human language in describing the essence of God. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how God's use of His name 'Yahweh' reveals His identity and covenant relationship with His people. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's revelation in understanding His character and relationship with His followers."
