## [Answer](../God_s_Revelation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, God introduces Himself by using several names that reflect different aspects of His character and relationship with humanity. The most well-known are Yahweh (יְהוָה) and Elohim (אֱלֹהִים).

The name Yahweh is used around 6,800 times in the Hebrew Bible. It is a proper noun that functions as a verb ("I Am") and conveys God's eternal and unchanging nature. In Exodus 3:14-15, when Moses asks for God's name, God replies, "I AM WHO I AM." He also says, "This is what you shall say to the Israelites: 'I AM has sent me to you.'"

The name Elohim appears around 2,500 times in the Hebrew Bible. It is a plural noun, but it is used in a singular context and usually refers to God as the one true deity. The use of the plural form underscores God's omnipotence and majesty, emphasizing His infinite nature.

In the New Testament, God is primarily referred to as "Father" (πατήρ), and Jesus often addresses Him as such in prayer. Additionally, Jesus reveals that He and the Father are one (John 10:30). The Holy Spirit is also mentioned frequently, particularly in the Gospel of John and the Book of Acts.

It's important to remember that these names and titles are human attempts to describe the unknowable nature of God, and they offer only a limited understanding of His essence. Ultimately, God is beyond our comprehension, and any name or title can only point us towards the mystery that is God.
