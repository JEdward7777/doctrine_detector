  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe respondent's answer accurately reflects the biblical teaching that new birth is a divine initiative, emphasizing God's work in causing a person to be born again. The response also correctly highlights the importance of recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation, as specified by the concern.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more explicit connections between the various aspects of the process (drawing, regeneration, conviction, repentance and faith, sanctification, and glorification). While the response does a good job of listing these steps, it could benefit from more detailed explanations and illustrations of how they work together to bring about spiritual rebirth.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that effectively addresses the concern and accurately reflects the biblical teaching on the process of salvation."
