The references to relevant Bible verses and the detailed steps involved in the process of salvation demonstrate a strong understanding of the concept. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting God's role as the initiator of new birth, which aligns with the Christian worldview of salvation being entirely a work of God's grace. Great job!"
