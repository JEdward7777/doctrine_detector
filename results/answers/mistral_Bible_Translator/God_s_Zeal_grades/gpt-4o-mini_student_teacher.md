## Question [God's Zeal](../../../questions/God_s_Zeal.md)

## Correct Answer
'The zeal of the Lord' refers to God's strong and persistent efforts to bless His people and ensure justice is served.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing God's zeal can deepen believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being.

## [Answer](../God_s_Zeal.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of the Bible, particularly in the Old Testament, the "zeal of the Lord" often refers to God's intense love and protective care for His people Israel. This zeal is not a passive or indifferent attitude but rather a deep, passionate commitment to upholding His covenant and preserving righteousness among His people.

For instance, in Numbers 25:10-13, we read about Phinehas, a descendant of Aaron the priest, who took zealous action against Zimri, a leader of Israel, and Cozbi, a Midianite woman, for their open disobedience to God. This act pleased God, and it is said that He granted an everlasting priesthood to Phinehas because of his "zeal" or fervent devotion to God's laws.

Similarly, in Ezekiel 39:25, it speaks of the zeal of the Lord bringing about the restoration and salvation of Israel after their exile. So, the term 'zeal of the Lord' reflects God's active, passionate love for His people, His commitment to upholding righteousness, and His desire to bring them back to Him when they stray.
