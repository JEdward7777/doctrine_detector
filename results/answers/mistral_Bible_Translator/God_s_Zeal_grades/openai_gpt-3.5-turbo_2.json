The connection to specific biblical examples further strengthens the explanation. The focus on God's zeal as a demonstration of His love and righteousness aligns well with the concern of deepening believers' trust in His commitment to their well-being. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept from a Christian worldview. The grade is slightly reduced only to allow room for additional biblical references or deeper exploration of theological nuances."
