It provides textual evidence from various passages to support the definition and highlights key aspects of living a godly life. The student clearly explains that godliness involves aligning one's actions with God's will, reflecting His character, and maintaining a personal relationship with Him through faith in Jesus Christ. The inclusion of practical aspects like discipline, virtue practice, and rejecting sin further strengthens the response."
