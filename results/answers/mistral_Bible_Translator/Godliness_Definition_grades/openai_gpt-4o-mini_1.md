## [Answer](../Godliness_Definition.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1 Timothy 2:3-4 provides a foundational understanding of godliness within the context of living one's life, stating, "This is good and pleasing to God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus."

In this passage, godliness can be defined as living a life in accordance with God's will, reflecting His nature and character, and actively seeking a personal relationship with Him through faith in Jesus Christ. In 1 Timothy 4:7-8, Paul writes that "discipline yourselves for the purpose of godliness" by training yourself to be godly, focusing on physical health and spiritual fitness, and avoiding worldly desires.

Godliness can also be seen through the practice of virtues such as love, kindness, humility, patience, self-control, and justice (see Galatians 5:22-23). In Titus 1:1, Paul refers to God as "God our Savior, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good." Living a godly life involves pursuing holiness, rejecting sin, and striving to live out the love of God in our actions, words, and attitudes.

Ultimately, being godly means living a life that honors God and reflects His character, with a desire to grow closer to Him through faith in Jesus Christ and a commitment to following His teachings.
