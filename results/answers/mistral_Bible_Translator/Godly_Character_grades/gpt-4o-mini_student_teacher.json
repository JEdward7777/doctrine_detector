  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the Fruits of the Holy Spirit as outlined in Galatians 5:22-23 and correctly identified them. However, the student included additional attributes beyond what was specifically listed in the provided reference answer. While these qualities are indeed commendable, the reference answer focused on a more concise list. Overall, the student's understanding of the characteristics of a godly individual and how to cultivate them is clear, but sticking closer to the reference answer would have strengthened their response."
