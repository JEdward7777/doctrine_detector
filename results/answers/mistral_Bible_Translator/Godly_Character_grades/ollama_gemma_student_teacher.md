 The Fruits of the Holy Spirit, as described in Galatians 5:22-23 (NIV), are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. These attributes demonstrate a person's godly character and growth in their relationship with God through the Holy Spirit. Each fruit represents a spiritual quality that should be evident in a believer's life as they yield themselves to the work of the Spirit.
