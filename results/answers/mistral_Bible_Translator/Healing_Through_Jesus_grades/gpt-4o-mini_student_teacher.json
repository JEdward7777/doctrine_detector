  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and well-explained answer demonstrating a good understanding of how Jesus approached healing demon-possessed individuals with both authority and compassion. The answer included relevant Bible references and highlighted Jesus' interaction with those afflicted by demons. However, the grade is lower due to the lack of emphasis on the specific concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. The focus was more on Jesus' overall approach rather than specifically addressing the concern provided."
