## [Answer](../Healing_Through_Jesus.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Bible, Jesus approached the healing of demon-possessed individuals with compassion and authority. In the Gospels, there are several instances where Jesus encounters people possessed by demons (Matthew 8:28-34, Mark 5:1-20, Luke 8:26-39).

In these accounts, it is clear that Jesus does not shy away from confronting the demons. He addresses them directly, commanding them to leave the individuals they possess. In every case, the demons obey Jesus' command and depart from their victims. This demonstrates Jesus' authority over demons as the Son of God (Matthew 12:28).

However, it is also important to note that Jesus' approach was one of compassion for the individuals who were suffering. He showed concern for their well-being and sought to free them from their affliction. In Luke 7:13, when Jairus asked Jesus to heal his daughter, Jesus "felt a sense of compassion for him" (NIV). This compassion was evident in His healing ministry as a whole, and it is clear that He approached each individual with love and concern for their physical and spiritual well-being.

Overall, Jesus' approach to healing demon-possessed individuals involved both authority over demons and compassion for the individuals who were suffering. He demonstrated His divine power by casting out the demons, but He also showed great empathy and concern for those who were afflicted. This balance between authority and compassion is a powerful example for Christians today as we seek to follow in Jesus' footsteps.
