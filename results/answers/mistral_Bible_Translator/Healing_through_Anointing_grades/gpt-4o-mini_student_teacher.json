  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that shows a clear understanding of the connection between anointing and healing in the New Testament, referencing specific passages and events. They have also highlighted the significance of anointing in both Jesus' ministry and the early church, supporting their points effectively. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the spiritual aspects of anointing in relation to healing, as the concern specifically asked for recognition of the spiritual component in Christian practice. Despite this, the student's answer demonstrates a good grasp of the topic."
