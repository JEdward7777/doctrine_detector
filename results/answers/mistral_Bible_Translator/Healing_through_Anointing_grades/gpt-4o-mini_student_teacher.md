 In the New Testament, the practice of anointing is closely associated with healing, particularly as it pertains to Jesus Christ and His ministry. This connection is primarily established through events documented in the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John).

Anointing, in this context, refers to the act of pouring or rubbing oil on someone's body as a sign of honor, respect, or healing. Oil was a common component in ancient Jewish practices for anointing and healing. In fact, the Hebrew word for anoint (mashach) can also mean "to smear with oil" or "to consecrate."

The most notable example of anointing related to healing is found in the account of Jesus Christ's ministry in Capernaum (Matthew 8:1-4; Mark 1:40-45). Here, a man with leprosy came and knelt before Jesus, asking for help. Jesus reached out and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was healed. Notably, in verses 3 & 6 of Mark's account, it mentions that Jesus "spat on his hands" and touched the man, and afterward Jesus "went out and about all the city, and he healed every disease and every affliction." These verses suggest a connection between Jesus' touch (or anointing) and the healing.

Additionally, in James 5:14-16, we find guidance for the practice of anointing the sick with oil as part of prayer for healing: "Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven." This passage demonstrates that the practice of anointing continued in the early church and was associated with healing and forgiveness.

In summary, the practice of anointing in the New Testament is related to healing as it was often part of Jesus' ministry and was later practiced by His followers as a means of seeking divine intervention for physical and spiritual ailments.

Comment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that shows a clear understanding of the connection between anointing and healing in the New Testament, referencing specific passages and events. They have also highlighted the significance of anointing in both Jesus' ministry and the early church, supporting their points effectively. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the spiritual aspects of anointing in relation to healing, as the concern specifically asked for recognition of the spiritual component in Christian practice. Despite this, the student's answer demonstrates a good grasp of the topic.
