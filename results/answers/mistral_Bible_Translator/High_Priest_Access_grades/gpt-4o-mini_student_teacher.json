  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and accurate answer, demonstrating a clear understanding of the specific individuals allowed to approach the Ark of the Covenant and the regulated circumstances. They correctly identified the high priest as the primary individual permitted to approach the ark once a year on the Day of Atonement, in line with the significance of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant. The additional information provided further contextualizes the role of priests, Levites, and other Israelites in relation to the Ark. Despite the minor deviation from the precise answer given by the teacher, the student's response showcases a solid knowledge of the biblical regulations regarding the Ark of the Covenant."
