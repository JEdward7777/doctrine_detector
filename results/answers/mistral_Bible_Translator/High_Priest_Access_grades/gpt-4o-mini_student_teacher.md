## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, only specific individuals were permitted to approach the Ark of the Covenant, and the circumstances were strictly regulated according to biblical law. The Ark of the Covenant was a sacred object that represented God's presence among the Israelites. It contained the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod (the staff of Levi), and manna (Exodus 25:10-22).

1. Priests (Aaron's descendants): The high priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) to make atonement for the sins of the people and Israel (Leviticus 16).

2. Levites: The Levites, who were descendants of Moses' brother, Aaron, were responsible for carrying the Ark during its journey through the wilderness and setting it up in the Tabernacle or Temple (Numbers 4:15). They could not, however, touch the Ark itself, as that was reserved only for the high priest.

3. Other Israelites: The general population of Israelites were prohibited from approaching the Ark under normal circumstances because it was too holy and their purity was not sufficient (Numbers 4:15). Even the priests could not come near it if they had any defilement or impurity upon them (Numbers 4:20).

It is important to note that these rules were specific to ancient Israelite worship, and modern Christian practices are based on the teachings of Jesus Christ and the New Testament. The Ark of the Covenant is no longer a central focus in Christianity as it was for the Israelites.
