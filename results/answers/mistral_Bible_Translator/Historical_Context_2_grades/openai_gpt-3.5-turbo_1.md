## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The reason the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt is explained in Exodus 12:34 and 13:7. According to these passages, they were instructed to do so because God wanted them to leave Egypt quickly without time to let their dough rise (unleavened bread). This was a symbol of the haste with which they had to depart from Egypt, as well as a commemoration of the Israelites' deliverance from slavery. The annual celebration of Passover, which includes eating unleavened bread, is a continuation of this tradition.
