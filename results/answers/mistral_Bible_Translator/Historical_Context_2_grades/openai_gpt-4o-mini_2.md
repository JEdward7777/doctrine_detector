## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The reason the Israelites ate unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt is explained in Exodus 12:34 and 13:7. According to these passages, they were instructed to do so because God wanted them to leave Egypt quickly without time to let their dough rise (unleavened bread). This was a symbol of the haste with which they had to depart from Egypt, as well as a commemoration of the Israelites' deliverance from slavery. The annual celebration of Passover, which includes eating unleavened bread, is a continuation of this tradition.
