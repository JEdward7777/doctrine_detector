  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation with relevant Bible verses from Isaiah and Amos that illustrate the concept of a remnant. They effectively connected the concept to faithfulness amidst apostasy or judgment. However, the student's answer could have been improved by focusing more on the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises, as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, they could have further emphasized the persistence in God's covenant as seen in the biblical events."
