  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of highlighting the concept of a remnant in Isaiah and Amos, and it provides specific examples from each book to illustrate the idea. The writer also recognizes the historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises, noting that it provides hope for future deliverance and restoration.\n\nHowever, there is room for improvement. For example, the response could have delved deeper into the cultural and historical context of the times in which these passages were written, and how they might have been understood by their original audience. Additionally, while the writer mentions the idea of a remnant providing hope for future deliverance, they could have explored this theme more fully, discussing how it relates to God's character and promises.\n\nOverall, I think this is a solid response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of a remnant in Isaiah and Amos. With some further development and analysis, it could be even stronger."
