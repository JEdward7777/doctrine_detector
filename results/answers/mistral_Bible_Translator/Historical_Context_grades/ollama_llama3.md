## [Answer](../Historical_Context.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the concept of "remnant" is often used to refer to a small group of people who remain faithful to God even amidst widespread apostasy or judgment. This idea is strongly conveyed in the books of Isaiah and Amos, which provide several examples that help illustrate this concept.

1. In Isaiah 1:9, the prophet states, "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah." This passage suggests that despite the sins of God's people (Israel), a remnant will be preserved and spared from destruction.

2. In Isaiah 4:3, God promises to "rebuild Jerusalem" and says, "Then the remnant of His people shall be called Zion." Here, the term "remnant" refers to those who remain faithful to God amidst judgment and exile and will eventually return to their homeland.

3. In Isaiah 10:20-22, God promises a future deliverance for His people: "In that day the remnant of Israel, and those of the house of Jacob who have escaped, will never again rely on the one who struck them down (but) will truly trust in the Lord, the Holy One of Israel."

4. In Amos 5:15, the prophet writes, "Seek good, and not evil, that you may live; and so the LORD, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you have said. Hate evil, love good, and establish justice in the gate. It may be that the LORD God Almighty will pardon the remnant of Joseph." This passage highlights the importance of seeking goodness and justice and suggests that a faithful remnant among the people of Israel will be spared from judgment.

These examples demonstrate the idea of a "remnant" as a small group of individuals who remain faithful to God amidst widespread apostasy or judgment, providing hope for future deliverance and restoration.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response does a good job of highlighting the concept of a remnant in Isaiah and Amos, and it provides specific examples from each book to illustrate the idea. The writer also recognizes the historical significance of the remnant in relation to God's promises, noting that it provides hope for future deliverance and restoration.

However, there is room for improvement. For example, the response could have delved deeper into the cultural and historical context of the times in which these passages were written, and how they might have been understood by their original audience. Additionally, while the writer mentions the idea of a remnant providing hope for future deliverance, they could have explored this theme more fully, discussing how it relates to God's character and promises.

Overall, I think this is a solid response that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of a remnant in Isaiah and Amos. With some further development and analysis, it could be even stronger.
