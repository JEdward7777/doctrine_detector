The examples given from the Bible effectively illustrate the persistence of God's covenant with a faithful remnant despite judgment and exile. The response could have been enhanced by explicitly connecting the historical significance of the remnant to the broader theme of God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises throughout Israel's history."
