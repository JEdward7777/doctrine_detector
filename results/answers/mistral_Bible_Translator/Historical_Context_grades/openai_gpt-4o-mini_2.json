  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a deep understanding of the historical significance of a remnant in relation to God's promises by referencing specific verses from Isaiah and Amos that showcase the concept of a faithful remnant amidst judgment and exile. The examples given effectively demonstrate the persistence of God's covenant with His people and their eventual restoration. The grade is high because the response shows a clear connection between the concept of a remnant in these biblical texts and God's promises throughout history."
