## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The division of Herod the Great's kingdom into four tetrarchies (Herod Antipas, Herod Archelaus, Herod Philip I, and a fourth ruled by Herodias) following his death in 4 BC had significant impacts on the Jewish people. Here are a few key points:

1. Political Instability: The division led to political instability among the Jewish population as each tetrarch sought to assert their power and maintain control over their respective territories. This instability often resulted in increased taxation, forced labor, and violence against the Jewish people.

2. Religious Tension: Each tetrarchy had its own administrative center where Greek culture and language were emphasized. As a result, the Hellenization of Judaism accelerated, causing religious tension between those who embraced Greek culture and those who adhered strictly to Jewish customs and traditions.

3. Conflicts with Roman Authorities: The tetrarchs' efforts to assert their power often led to conflicts with the Roman authorities, which in turn had a negative impact on the Jewish people. For example, Herod Antipas executed John the Baptist at the behest of his wife Herodias, and later he played a role in the trial and crucifixion of Jesus Christ (Matthew 27:1-26).

4. Struggle for Independence: The political instability and religious tension caused by the division of Herod's kingdom ultimately contributed to the Jewish desire for independence, leading to the Great Jewish Revolt in AD 66 that eventually resulted in the destruction of the Second Temple and the exile of many Jews from Jerusalem.

Overall, the division of Herod the Great's kingdom into tetrarchies increased political instability, caused religious tension, led to conflicts with Roman authorities, and contributed to the struggle for Jewish independence.
