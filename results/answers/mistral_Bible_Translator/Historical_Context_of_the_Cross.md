## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Roman practice of crucifixion significantly impacted the perception of the cross in early Christianity, as it was a brutal and public form of execution reserved for those considered to be the worst criminals. Jesus' crucifixion on the cross was not just another Roman execution; it was a fulfillment of prophecies found in the Old Testament about the Messiah (see Isaiah 53:5, Psalm 22).

The cross, therefore, came to symbolize suffering, sacrifice, and redemption within early Christianity. The death of Jesus on the cross is seen as a voluntary act where he willingly gave up his life as an atonement for sin (see John 10:18). This interpretation of the cross was in sharp contrast to its association with shame and punishment in Roman culture.

Moreover, the resurrection of Jesus three days later affirmed that the cross was not just a symbol of defeat but also of victory over death and sin. The empty tomb became a powerful reminder that Christ had conquered death and offered eternal life to those who believe in him (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).

So, while the Roman practice of crucifixion initially brought shame and disgrace upon the cross, it ultimately served as a means for Christians to proclaim the gospel message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
