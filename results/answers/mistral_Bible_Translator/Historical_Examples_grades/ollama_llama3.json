  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response is strong because it provides several examples from Scripture that demonstrate how building altars was a tangible expression of faith and obedience. The writer's explanation of the significance of these events, such as Abraham's altar representing his commitment to follow God and Jacob's altar signifying his experience and commitment to follow God, shows an understanding of the biblical context.\n\nHowever, I would deduct 15 points because this response does not directly address the concern about inspiring Christians to express their faith and devotion through intentional acts of worship. While the examples provided do relate to worship, the connection is not explicitly made. To fully address the concern, the writer could have highlighted how these biblical examples can inspire modern-day believers to intentionally build altars or create sacred spaces in their daily lives.\n\nOverall, this response provides a good overview of the biblical concept of building altars, but could be strengthened by explicitly connecting it to the concern about inspiring worship."
