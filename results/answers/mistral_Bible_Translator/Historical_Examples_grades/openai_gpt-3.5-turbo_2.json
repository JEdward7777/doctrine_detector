  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of building altars in the Bible, citing multiple examples to support the argument. The response effectively connects the historical examples provided to the concern about inspiring Christians to express their faith and devotion through intentional acts of worship. The only room for improvement would be to include a brief conclusion summarizing the main points made in the response. Overall, well done!"
