  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-structured approach to introducing the concept of the Holy Spirit in contexts unfamiliar with the Trinity. They have covered various aspects of the Holy Spirit's identity, role in creation, guidance for believers, and spiritual gifts. The step-by-step method is effective in ensuring clear understanding. However, the student could improve their answer by further emphasizing the divinity of the Holy Spirit as a distinct person within the Trinity, in line with the teacher's reference answer. This emphasis is crucial to prevent misconceptions about the Holy Spirit's identity and work."
