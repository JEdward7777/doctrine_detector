  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of hope in a Christian worldview. They referenced relevant Bible passages and accurately discussed the implications of hopelessness in relation to faith in God's promises. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the concern by explicitly mentioning the contrast between having hope in God's promises and the consequences of lacking such hope."
