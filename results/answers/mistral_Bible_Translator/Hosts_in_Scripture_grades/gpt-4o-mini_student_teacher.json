  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the term \"hosts\" in scripture, focusing on its depiction as celestial beings, supernatural forces, and organized military-like structures under God's command. The student's examples from Daniel and 1 Kings effectively illustrate the concept. The answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer and effectively addresses the concern regarding the impact of understanding spiritual warfare and divine authority on a believer's perspective."
