It acknowledges the different contexts in which the term is used. The answer effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the role of spiritual warfare and divine authority in shaping a believer's perspective on prayer and spiritual battles. However, it could have further emphasized the significance of God's ultimate authority in these battles and the importance of relying on Him in prayer."
