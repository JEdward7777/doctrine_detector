  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-thought-out answer from a Christian perspective, referencing relevant Bible passages and emphasizing the importance of replacing jealousy with Godly virtues and seeking guidance through prayer. However, the student's response focused more on internal reflection and personal growth rather than directly addressing the impact of jealousy on relationships. The reference answer highlighted the need for open communication and trust in relationships, which was not as explicitly addressed in the student's response. Thus, while the student's answer contained valuable insights, it could have been strengthened by including more emphasis on the relational aspect of jealousy and its potential impact on others."
