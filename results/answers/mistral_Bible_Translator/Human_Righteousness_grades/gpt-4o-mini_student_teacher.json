  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that effectively explains the concept of being declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ according to Christian theology. They accurately referenced relevant Bible verses and elaborated on the process of justification by faith. The student also correctly emphasized the importance of faith in Jesus for salvation and clarified the relationship between faith, works, and salvation. The answer aligns well with the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern raised. However, the reference answer succinctly captures the essence of being declared righteous in Christ, hence a slight deduction in the grade."
