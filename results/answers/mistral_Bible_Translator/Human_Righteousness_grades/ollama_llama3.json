  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian theology, particularly in regards to justification by faith alone. The student correctly explains that a person can be declared righteous through trust in Jesus Christ, and that this righteousness is attributed to them by God. The mention of sola fide and the distinction between earning salvation through works and evidence of a transformed heart are also well-handled.\n\nThe only area for improvement is the lack of explicit reference to specific Bible verses or passages, which could further support and illustrate the student's understanding. Nevertheless, the response provides a clear and concise explanation of the concept, and effectively addresses the concern of clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus."
