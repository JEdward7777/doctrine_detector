  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of how a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ, highlighting key biblical passages and the theological concept of justification by faith alone. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the essential connection between human righteousness and faith in Jesus for understanding salvation. The inclusion of the Reformation concept of sola fide further enriches the explanation from a Christian worldview perspective. Overall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic."
