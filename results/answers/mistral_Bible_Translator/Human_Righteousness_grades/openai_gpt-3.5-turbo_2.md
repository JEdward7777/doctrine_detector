## Question [Human Righteousness](../../../questions/Human_Righteousness.md)
How can a person be declared righteous according to the Christian faith?

A person can be declared righteous when they trust in Jesus to save them, as God cleanses them from their sins and attributes Jesusâ€™ righteousness to them.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying the basis for human righteousness as it relates to faith in Jesus is essential for understanding salvation.

## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, a person can be declared righteous through faith in Jesus Christ. This concept is rooted in the Bible, particularly in books like Romans and Galatians. According to the New Testament, all have sinned (Romans 3:23) and fallen short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). However, God has provided a way for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, who died for our sins and was raised on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:3-4).

By believing that Jesus is Lord and confessing that God raised Him from the dead, a person can be justified or declared righteous by faith (Romans 10:9). This does not mean that we will never sin again or that we are perfect, but rather that our sins have been forgiven and we are positioned in a right relationship with God through Jesus Christ.

This concept is often described as justification by faith alone, or sola fide, one of the five solas of the Reformation. It is important to note that this does not mean that works or good deeds have no place in a Christian's life. Instead, they are the evidence of a transformed heart and faith, rather than the means of earning salvation (Ephesians 2:8-10).
