The steps recommended, such as studying the Bible, consistent prayer, seeking wisdom from others, humility, love, self-control, forgiveness, service, confession, and accountability, are all key components of living authentically according to God's Word. The only suggestion for improvement would be to emphasize the importance of repentance as a key step in addressing hypocrisy and restoring integrity in the context of the Christian worldview."
