## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of the Bible, when God says "I have called you by name," it is often used to emphasize a personal and intimate relationship between Him and an individual or group of people. This phrase appears several times in the Old Testament, such as in Isaiah 43:1 ("Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are Mine") and Exodus 3:4 ("When the LORD saw that he had turned aside to see, God called to him from the midst of the bush...").

In these passages, God's personal, direct address to Moses and to His people signifies a relationship based on knowledge, love, and belonging. It indicates that each person is not just a part of a large crowd or mass but that they have been singled out and known by name by the Creator of the universe. This emphasizes God's personal involvement in their lives and His desire for an intimate connection with each one of us.
