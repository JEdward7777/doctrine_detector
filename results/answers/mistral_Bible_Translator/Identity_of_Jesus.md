## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The name "Jesus" (Ιησους in Greek) is a translation of the Hebrew name "Yeshua" or "Jeshua," which means "God saves." In Christian theology, Jesus Christ's name signifies His divine mission to save humanity from sin. This salvation is achieved through His life, death on the cross, and resurrection, according to the New Testament in the Bible. As the Messiah (Anointed One), Jesus is believed by Christians to fulfill the promises made to Israel throughout the Old Testament, offering redemption and eternal life to all who believe in Him. This interpretation of Jesus' name emphasizes His role as a Savior sent by God to reconcile humanity with the divine.
