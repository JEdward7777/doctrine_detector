They referenced the incident with the golden calf in Exodus, King Solomon's downfall into idolatry in 1 Kings, and the New Testament warning against idolatry in Corinthians. The response effectively conveys the seriousness of idolatry and its implications in both the Old and New Testaments. A strong emphasis on the eternal consequences of idolatry and a deeper exploration of God's righteous judgment could have further bolstered the answer."
