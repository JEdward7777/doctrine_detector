  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough answer with relevant examples from both the Old and New Testaments to illustrate the consequences of idolatry among God's people. They effectively tied in the significance of these consequences in helping Christians understand the seriousness of straying from God's commandments. The answer was well-structured and demonstrated a solid grasp of the topic. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher succinctly captured the essence of the consequences of idolatry without going into specific examples, which could have been more directly addressed in the student's response."
