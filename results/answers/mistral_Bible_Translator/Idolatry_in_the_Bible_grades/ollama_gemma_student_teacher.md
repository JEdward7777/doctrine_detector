## [Answer](../Idolatry_in_the_Bible.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible provides numerous examples and warnings about the consequences of idolatry among God's people. One notable instance can be found in the Old Testament book of Exodus, where the Israelites, having fled from Egypt, worshipped a golden calf while Moses was receiving the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. God's wrath was kindled against them, and as a result, He proclaimed: "I have seen these people, and indeed, they are a stiff-necked people" (Exodus 32:9).

Another example is found in the story of King Solomon, who started off his reign with great devotion to God but later fell into idolatry. The Bible states that as a result, "there was no king in Israel who sinned more than he" (1 Kings 11:6). This led to the division of Israel into two kingdoms and ultimately to their defeat and exile.

The New Testament also warns against idolatry. In his letter to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul writes: "Flee from idolatry" (1 Corinthians 10:14). He goes on to explain that the food offered to idols is not what defiles a person but the practice of idolatry itself.

These examples illustrate that idolatry, or the worship of anything other than God, leads to God's wrath and judgment, as well as spiritual and temporal consequences for individuals and communities. It is a grave sin that should be avoided at all costs.
