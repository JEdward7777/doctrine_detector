The biblical references provided are aptly used to support the argument, highlighting the Christian values of love, respect, and justice. The discussion on seeing others as created in the image of God and deserving dignity adds depth to the response. The link to forgiveness and reconciliation within the Christian community could have been explored further to enhance the overall coherence of the argument."
