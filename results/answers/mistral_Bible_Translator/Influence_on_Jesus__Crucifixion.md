## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Roman authorities were ultimately responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus, but the Sadducees and Pharisees played a significant role in setting events into motion. It is important to note that both groups had different beliefs and roles within Jewish society during that time.

The Sadducees were primarily high priests, aristocrats, and members of the religious establishment who did not believe in the resurrection or angels, among other things. They saw Jesus as a threat to their power and authority since He often criticized them for neglecting God's laws. When the Sanhedrin (the Jewish supreme court) heard about Jesus performing miracles on the Sabbath, they viewed it as a violation of Jewish law and decided to arrest Him. However, they did not have the authority to execute someone by crucifixion; that power lay with the Romans.

The Pharisees, on the other hand, were a more conservative and influential group of Jewish scholars who believed in oral traditions and the resurrection of the dead. They initially supported Jesus and His teachings, but as He gained popularity, they grew increasingly wary of His influence over the people. Some Pharisees might have reported Jesus to the Roman authorities out of jealousy or a desire to preserve their own power and status within Jewish society.

Regarding the character of both groups, it is evident that the Sadducees prioritized maintaining their wealth, power, and influence over upholding God's law. They were willing to manipulate religious and political systems for their benefit. The Pharisees, on the other hand, may have acted out of a misguided sense of duty and concern for religious orthodoxy, but they failed to recognize and embrace Jesus as the Messiah. Their actions ultimately led to His death, which was a tragedy for humanity and a fulfillment of biblical prophecy.

In summary, both the Sadducees and Pharisees played key roles in setting events into motion that led to the crucifixion of Jesus, but it is essential to remember that ultimate responsibility lies with the Roman authorities who carried out the execution. Their actions reveal a lack of understanding and openness to God's will, as well as a focus on self-interest over upholding God's law and loving their neighbors.
