  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the roles of the Sadducees and Pharisees in the crucifixion of Jesus and how their actions were influenced by their desire to protect their own power and authority. The student effectively analyzed the character of these groups within the context of the conflict with Jesus. However, the student could have further emphasized the perspective of self-interest, hypocrisy, and condemnation by Jesus in their response, aligning more closely with the teacher's provided answer."
