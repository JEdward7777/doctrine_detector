  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders in ancient Judea. The student clearly explains the different beliefs and motivations of the Sadducees and Pharisees, and how their actions ultimately led to Jesus' crucifixion. The conclusion is well-reasoned and highlights the selfishness and hypocrisy of the religious leaders."
