## [Answer](../Inheriting_Eternal_Life.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to several passages in the New Testament of the Bible, inheriting eternal life is tied to faith and belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God. In Mark 16:16, it states, "Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned." In John 3:16, it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

Additionally, faith in Jesus is often accompanied by obedience to His teachings and living a righteous life (Matthew 7:21, James 2:14-26). However, it's important to note that salvation through faith in Christ is a free gift from God (Ephesians 2:8-9), and we are saved by grace through faith.

This concept is further explained throughout the New Testament books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians. It's always a good idea to consult with a pastor or trusted Christian leader for a deeper understanding.
