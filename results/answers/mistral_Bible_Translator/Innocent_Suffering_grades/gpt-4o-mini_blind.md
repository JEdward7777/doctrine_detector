## [Answer](../Innocent_Suffering.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the concept of "innocent blood" is addressed primarily in the Old Testament, specifically in Leviticus 17:11, which states, "For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life." This verse underscores the importance of preserving human life and emphasizes that God considers all innocent lives as precious.

The concept of "innocent blood" is also mentioned in several other passages, such as Exodus 20:13 ("You shall not murder.") and Deuteronomy 5:20 ("Neither shall there be found among you anyone who sacrifices his son or his daughter in the fire, or uses divination, or practices sorcery, or interprets omens, or engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or is a medium or necromancer, or who consults ghosts and spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead."), emphasizing that God places a high value on human life and forbids taking it unjustly.

The Book of Acts in the New Testament also refers to this concept when Ananias and Sapphira lie about their financial contributions to the church, and Peter condemns them by saying, "While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God." (Acts 5:4)

Overall, the Bible consistently upholds that all human life is sacred and valuable, with a particular emphasis on preserving the lives of innocent people. This belief has significant implications for Christian ethical and moral principles, including the prohibition of murder, the promotion of justice, and the protection of vulnerable populations.
