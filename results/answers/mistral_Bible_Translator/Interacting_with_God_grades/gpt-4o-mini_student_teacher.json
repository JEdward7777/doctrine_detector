They referenced relevant Bible verses and articulated how seeking God, obeying His commands, following His guidance, prayer, and being filled with the Holy Spirit are all crucial aspects of aligning with God's will. The explanation was clear, detailed, and demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic. Great job!"
