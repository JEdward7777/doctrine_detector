## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian teaching, "the last day" generally refers to the end of time or the eschaton, which is the final part of history leading up to and including the return of Jesus Christ and the consummation of God's plan for creation. It is a term used in both the Old and New Testaments to describe a future day of judgment and renewal.

In John 6:39-40, Jesus says, "This is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day."

In 2 Peter 3:3-4, the apostle Peter writes about "scoffers" who deny that there will be a future day of judgment and say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our ancestors died, all things continue as they did from the beginning of creation."

The exact interpretation and details of the last day are subject to various eschatological views within Christianity. Some believe in a pre-tribulation rapture, others in a post-tribulation rapture, while still others reject the rapture altogether. These interpretations reflect different understandings of Scripture and how it relates to the end times. Ultimately, the last day is a time when God will bring all things to completion, judging the living and the dead and establishing His eternal kingdom.
