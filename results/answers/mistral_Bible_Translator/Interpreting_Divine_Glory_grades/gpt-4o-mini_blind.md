## [Answer](../Interpreting_Divine_Glory.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of worship, divine glory refers to the radiant and magnificent splendor that God possesses, which reveals His eternal, infinite, and perfect nature. This glory is a reflection of His holiness, power, wisdom, love, justice, faithfulness, and other divine attributes. Worshiping God in response to His glory means recognizing and honoring Him for who He truly is. It's an act of acknowledging God's sovereignty, submitting ourselves to His will, and expressing our gratitude, praise, and devotion towards Him.

In the Bible, divine glory is often associated with the manifestation of God's presence, as seen in the burning bush (Exodus 3:2), the cloud by day and fire by night during the Exodus (Exodus 13:21-22), and Jesus transfigured on the mountain (Matthew 17:1-8). It is also emphasized in passages like Isaiah 6:3, where the prophet describes seeing God's throne and the seraphim crying out, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory!" (NKJV)

Worshiping God in light of His divine glory means acknowledging His worthiness and responding appropriately through obedience, praise, and humility. It's about aligning our lives with God's perfect character and glorifying Him in all we do, as commanded in 1 Corinthians 10:31 (NKJV), "Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
