 In the context of biblical language, particularly in the Old Testament, the phrase "Most High" (Hebrew: אֵל עֶלְיוֹן, El Elyon) is used to describe God's supremacy and sovereignty over all creation. The term "high" here signifies not physical elevation but rather God's exalted nature, His infinite greatness, power, and holiness. It underscores God's transcendence above the earthly realm, emphasizing that He is the ultimate authority, the one who governs all things, and the one to whom all praise, honor, and worship are due.

The use of the term "Most High" in relation to God serves to remind us of His unique nature and position as Creator, Ruler, and Judge. It reminds us that God is not bound by space or time and stands above all creation, deserving our reverence and devotion. Ultimately, this title highlights God's awe-inspiring greatness, transcendence, and sovereignty over all things.
