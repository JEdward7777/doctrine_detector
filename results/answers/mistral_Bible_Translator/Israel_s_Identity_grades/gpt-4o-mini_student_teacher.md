## [Answer](../Israel_s_Identity.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of its biblical origin, the name "Israel" signifies God's chosen people. It was first given by God to Jacob (later renamed Israel) after he wrestled with an angel and prevailed. Genesis 32:28 states, "Then the man said, 'Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.'"

Throughout the Old Testament, "Israel" generally refers to the twelve tribes of Israel or the kingdoms of Israel (North) and Judah (South). As a collective noun, it signifies the people chosen by God to be His covenant people. In the New Testament, the term "Israel" is used in various ways, but it often refers to ethnic Jews or descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. However, the Apostle Paul teaches that spiritual Israel, the true heirs of God's promises, are those who have faith in Christ (Romans 9:6-8). Ultimately, Israel is a significant part of God's redemptive plan throughout history.
