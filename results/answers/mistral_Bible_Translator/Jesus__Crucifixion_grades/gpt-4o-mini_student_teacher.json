  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and informative response, explaining the significance of the offer of wine mixed with myrrh during Jesus' crucifixion. The student correctly interpreted this offer as a form of pain relief commonly used during executions in the ancient world. However, the student did not address the specified concern of reflecting on Jesus' refusal leading to deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission. To improve the grade, the student should have focused more on Jesus' refusal of the wine mixed with myrrh and how it reflects his full acceptance of his sacrificial role, as stated in the reference answer."
