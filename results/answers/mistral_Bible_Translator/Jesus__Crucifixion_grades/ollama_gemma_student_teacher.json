  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the biblical text and the Christian worldview. The student clearly explains the historical context of the offering of wine and myrrh, while also noting the absence of explicit textual evidence regarding Jesus' acceptance or refusal. The theological interpretation of the offering as a symbol of Christ's sacrificial love is particularly insightful and demonstrates a strong grasp of Christian doctrine."
