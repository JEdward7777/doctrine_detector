## Question [Jesus’ Crucifixion](../../../questions/Jesus__Crucifixion.md)
What does the offer of wine mixed with myrrh indicate about Jesus' experience on the cross?

## Correct Answer
The offer of wine mixed with myrrh was meant to ease Jesus' pain and suffering, yet he refused it, reflecting his full acceptance of his sacrificial role.

## Stated Concern
Reflecting on Jesus' refusal can lead to deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Crucifixion.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Gospel accounts, an offer of wine mixed with myrrh is presented to Jesus during His crucifixion (Matthew 27:34, Mark 15:23, Luke 23:36, John 19:29). This was a common practice in the ancient world for alleviating pain and reducing anxiety during the execution process. The wine offered to Jesus would have been fortified with myrrh as a painkiller and anesthetic.

The offering of this mixture to Jesus suggests that even in His suffering, Jesus was given aid to help endure the excruciating pain of crucifixion. However, it is important to note that scripture does not explicitly state whether Jesus accepted or refused this offer. The significance of the wine and myrrh offering lies in its representation of Christ's willingness to suffer for our salvation, as well as the compassionate efforts made by those around Him to alleviate some of His pain.

In a broader theological context, the offer of wine mixed with myrrh serves as an emblem of Jesus' sacrificial love and obedience on the cross. By willingly accepting this excruciating death, Jesus demonstrated His unfathomable love for humanity and His ultimate purpose to redeem mankind from sin (Romans 5:8). The offering of wine mixed with myrrh highlights both the physical anguish endured by Jesus during His crucifixion and the divine purpose behind it.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response a 60.

The response does not fully engage with the concern of reflecting on Jesus' refusal to accept the wine mixed with myrrh, which is the main focus of the answer. While it mentions that scripture does not explicitly state whether Jesus accepted or refused the offer, it does not delve deeper into the significance of his decision and how it relates to his mission.

The response also spends more time on the general context of the offering of wine mixed with myrrh, discussing its representation of Christ's willingness to suffer for our salvation and the compassionate efforts made by those around Him. While this provides some background information, it does not directly address the concern of reflecting on Jesus' refusal.

To improve this response, I would suggest providing more analysis on why Jesus might have refused the offer, how his acceptance or rejection of the wine reflects his commitment to his mission, and what deeper insights can be gained from his decision.
