# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Gospel accounts, an offer of wine mixed with myrrh is presented to Jesus during His crucifixion (Matthew 27:34, Mark 15:23, Luke 23:36, John 19:29). This was a common practice in the ancient world for alleviating pain and reducing anxiety during the execution process. The wine offered to Jesus would have been fortified with myrrh as a painkiller and anesthetic.

The offering of this mixture to Jesus suggests that even in His suffering, Jesus was given aid to help endure the excruciating pain of crucifixion. However, it is important to note that scripture does not explicitly state whether Jesus accepted or refused this offer. The significance of the wine and myrrh offering lies in its representation of Christ's willingness to suffer for our salvation, as well as the compassionate efforts made by those around Him to alleviate some of His pain.

In a broader theological context, the offer of wine mixed with myrrh serves as an emblem of Jesus' sacrificial love and obedience on the cross. By willingly accepting this excruciating death, Jesus demonstrated His unfathomable love for humanity and His ultimate purpose to redeem mankind from sin (Romans 5:8). The offering of wine mixed with myrrh highlights both the physical anguish endured by Jesus during His crucifixion and the divine purpose behind it.
