  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a clear and accurate explanation of Jesus' statement, \"I am the Resurrection and the Life,\" using scripture from John 11:25-26. They effectively conveyed the profound significance of Jesus being the source of eternal life and emphasized the dual aspect of physical resurrection and spiritual life through faith in Him. The explanation aligns well with Christian doctrine and provides a strong theological understanding of the concept. Well done!"
