  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thoughtful explanation of Jesus' statement and its significance in terms of eternal life and spiritual understanding. The student correctly identifies Jesus as the source of resurrection and eternal life, aligning well with the teacher's reference answer. However, the student's response could further emphasize the importance of Jesus' identity as the Son of God and His pivotal role in salvation, connecting it more explicitly to Christian faith and theology."
