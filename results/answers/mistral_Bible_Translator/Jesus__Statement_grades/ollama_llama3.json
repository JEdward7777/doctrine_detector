  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response provides some accurate information about Jesus' statement in John 11:25-26, correctly highlighting its significance for understanding Jesus' role in resurrection. The writer's explanation that Jesus is not only the One who brings people back to life from the dead but also the One who gives eternal life is a good summary of Jesus' message.\n\nHowever, there are some areas for improvement. The response could benefit from more specific biblical support and deeper theological reflection on the implications of Jesus' statement. For example, the writer does not explicitly address the concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, which is an important aspect of understanding faith and theology.\n\nAdditionally, the response's interpretation of Jesus' statement is somewhat superficial and lacks nuance. A more detailed analysis of Jesus' claim to be \"the resurrection\" would provide a richer understanding of his message.\n\nOverall, while this response provides some good insights, it could be improved by delving deeper into the biblical text and theological implications."
