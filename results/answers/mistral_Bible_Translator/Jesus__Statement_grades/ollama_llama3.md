## Question [Jesus' Statement](../../../questions/Jesus__Statement.md)
What did Jesus mean when he said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life'?

## Correct Answer
When Jesus said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life,' he meant that he is the source of resurrection and the one who causes people to come back to life.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection is important for faith and theological understanding.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Statement.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In John 11:25-26, Jesus says, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die."

Jesus was making a profound statement about His role as the source of eternal life, which is also referred to as the resurrection. He was emphasizing that faith in Him leads not just to physical survival after death, but to spiritual life â€“ a state of being with God forever. In other words, Jesus is stating that He is not only the One who brings people back to life from the dead (resurrection), but also the One who gives eternal life (life). This life with Him transcends the physical realm and offers everlasting communion with God.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response provides some accurate information about Jesus' statement in John 11:25-26, correctly highlighting its significance for understanding Jesus' role in resurrection. The writer's explanation that Jesus is not only the One who brings people back to life from the dead but also the One who gives eternal life is a good summary of Jesus' message.

However, there are some areas for improvement. The response could benefit from more specific biblical support and deeper theological reflection on the implications of Jesus' statement. For example, the writer does not explicitly address the concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, which is an important aspect of understanding faith and theology.

Additionally, the response's interpretation of Jesus' statement is somewhat superficial and lacks nuance. A more detailed analysis of Jesus' claim to be "the resurrection" would provide a richer understanding of his message.

Overall, while this response provides some good insights, it could be improved by delving deeper into the biblical text and theological implications.
