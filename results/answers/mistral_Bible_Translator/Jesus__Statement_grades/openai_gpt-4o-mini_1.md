## Question [Jesus' Statement](../../../questions/Jesus__Statement.md)
What did Jesus mean when he said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life'?

## Correct Answer
When Jesus said, 'I am the Resurrection and the Life,' he meant that he is the source of resurrection and the one who causes people to come back to life.

## Stated Concern
Clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection is important for faith and theological understanding.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Statement.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In John 11:25-26, Jesus says, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die."

Jesus was making a profound statement about His role as the source of eternal life, which is also referred to as the resurrection. He was emphasizing that faith in Him leads not just to physical survival after death, but to spiritual life â€“ a state of being with God forever. In other words, Jesus is stating that He is not only the One who brings people back to life from the dead (resurrection), but also the One who gives eternal life (life). This life with Him transcends the physical realm and offers everlasting communion with God.
