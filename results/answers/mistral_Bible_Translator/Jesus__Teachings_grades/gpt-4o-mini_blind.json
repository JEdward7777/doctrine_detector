The connection to Matthew 6:13 is appropriate and adds clarity to the point being made. However, the response could be strengthened by further emphasizing that Jesus' use of \"Amen\" went beyond mere confirmation and actually served to underline the authority and divine origin of His teachings. Additionally, integrating more scriptural references to demonstrate the significance of this term in Jesus' ministry would enhance the depth of the explanation."
