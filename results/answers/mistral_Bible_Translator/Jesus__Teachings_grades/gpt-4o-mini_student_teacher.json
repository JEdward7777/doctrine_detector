  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Based on the concern provided, I would grade the student's answer as 70.\n\nThe student correctly identified that Jesus used the term \"Amen\" to affirm the truthfulness of His teachings, which aligns with recognizing the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture. However, the student missed the mark slightly in emphasizing the truth aspect instead of the authority aspect. Additionally, the student provided relevant scriptural reference (Matthew 6:13) to support their explanation. Overall, the student demonstrated an understanding of the concept but could have further highlighted the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture."
