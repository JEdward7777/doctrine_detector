## Question [Jesus' Teachings](../../../questions/Jesus__Teachings.md)
How did Jesus use the term 'amen' to emphasize His teachings?

## Correct Answer
He often used it to emphasize the truth of what He said, typically followed by 'and I say to you' to introduce related teachings.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, Jesus often used the word "Amen" not as an emphasis on His teachings, but rather as an affirmation or confirmation of what He was saying. For example, in Matthew 6:13, Jesus teaches His disciples to pray with the phrase "Amen, amen" (KJV) which means, "I assure you, I tell you" or "Truly, truly." Jesus used "Amen" to underscore the authenticity and solemnity of His teachings. It is important to note that this usage does not necessarily imply an emphasis on His teachings as much as it highlights their truthfulness.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Based on the concern provided, I would grade the student's answer as 70.

The student correctly identified that Jesus used the term "Amen" to affirm the truthfulness of His teachings, which aligns with recognizing the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture. However, the student missed the mark slightly in emphasizing the truth aspect instead of the authority aspect. Additionally, the student provided relevant scriptural reference (Matthew 6:13) to support their explanation. Overall, the student demonstrated an understanding of the concept but could have further highlighted the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture.
