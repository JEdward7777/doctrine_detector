  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the textual usage of \"Amen\" in the New Testament. It accurately points out that Jesus primarily used the word to affirm the truthfulness of his teachings, rather than as an emphasis on them. The student also provides a relevant example from Matthew 6:13 to support their claim. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on how Jesus' use of \"Amen\" reinforces the authority and significance of his teachings within a Christian worldview."
