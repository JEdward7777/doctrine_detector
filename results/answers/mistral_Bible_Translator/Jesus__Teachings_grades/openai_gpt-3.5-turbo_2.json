It properly addresses the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words in Scripture, showing an understanding of the significance of Jesus' affirmations. There is a slight deviation from the original answer in terms of the introduction of related teachings after \"Amen,\" but overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview perspective."
