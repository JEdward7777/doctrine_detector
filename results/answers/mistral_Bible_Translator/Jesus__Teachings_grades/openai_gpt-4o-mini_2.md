He often used it to emphasize the truth of what He said, typically followed by 'and I say to you' to introduce related teachings.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture.

## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, Jesus often used the word "Amen" not as an emphasis on His teachings, but rather as an affirmation or confirmation of what He was saying. For example, in Matthew 6:13, Jesus teaches His disciples to pray with the phrase "Amen, amen" (KJV) which means, "I assure you, I tell you" or "Truly, truly." Jesus used "Amen" to underscore the authenticity and solemnity of His teachings. It is important to note that this usage does not necessarily imply an emphasis on His teachings as much as it highlights their truthfulness.
