## Question [Jesus as High Priest](../../../questions/Jesus_as_High_Priest.md)
How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

## Correct Answer
Jesus is referred to as our 'great high priest' who intercedes for us in God's presence and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, meaning that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, Jesus is often referred to as our High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16, 8:1-2). This title signifies His role in mediating between God and humanity. Unlike the Levitical priests under the Old Covenant who offered animal sacrifices for sins, Jesus, as our Great High Priest, offers a perfect sacrifice - Himself - on our behalf (Hebrews 9:11-14). This means that through His atoning death and resurrection, believers no longer need to offer animal sacrifices to gain access to God or seek forgiveness for sin. Instead, we approach God through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:18).

This shift from the Old Testament priesthood to Christ as our High Priest emphasizes that Jesus' sacrifice is once and for all, sufficient for the sins of all who believe in Him (Hebrews 7:26-28; 10:10-14). This new covenant established by Jesus' priestly work brings salvation and eternal life to those who trust in Him.
