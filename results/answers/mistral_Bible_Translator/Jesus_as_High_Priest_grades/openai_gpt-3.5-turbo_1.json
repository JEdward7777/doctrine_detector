The student demonstrates a clear grasp of the concept and effectively communicates how Jesus' sacrifice abolishes the need for animal sacrifices. The only minor improvement could be to include a brief mention of how Jesus' priesthood fulfills and surpasses the Old Testament priesthood to further emphasize the transformative nature of Christ's role."
