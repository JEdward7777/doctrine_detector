It highlights the uniqueness of Jesus' sacrifice compared to the animal sacrifices offered by human priests under the Old Covenant, emphasizing the sufficiency of His atoning death for the forgiveness of sins. The response effectively communicates the theological implications of Jesus' priestly work in bringing salvation and eternal life to believers."
