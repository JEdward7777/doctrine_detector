## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, Jesus is often described as having a unique and superior priesthood in comparison to the Old Testament high priests. Here are some key passages that illustrate this:

1. Hebrews 4:14-16 - "Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need."

   This passage emphasizes Jesus' unique high priesthood because He is the one who has ascended into heaven, whereas Old Testament high priests served only in the earthly temple. Additionally, unlike the Old Testament high priests who were tempted but could not perfectly resist sin, Jesus was tempted yet remained without sin, making Him a more effective intercessor for humanity.

2. Hebrews 5:1-4 - "For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer. If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are those who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, for when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed, ‘See that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.’ But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises."

   This passage highlights how Jesus' priesthood surpasses that of the Old Testament high priests because His ministry is heavenly and based on a better covenant with better promises. This superiority comes from the fact that Jesus Himself is the source of the new covenant rather than being merely an administrator like the earthly high priests.

3. Hebrews 7:1-28 - "This Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth of everything. In the one priesthood he holds a lifetime appointment, being made a priest permanently like Melchizedek. For when on the one hand there is another priest who resembles Melchizedek, perfect in every respect, one who has become a priest not by means of a law of physical requirement but by the power of an indestructible life, he holds the priesthood permanently."

   In this passage, the author of Hebrews makes a comparison between Jesus and Melchizedek, a prefiguration of Christ as a king-priest. They both do not have a successor, indicating their perpetual high priesthood, unlike the Old Testament high priests who served for a limited time and had successors. This passage further emphasizes Jesus' unique high priesthood by comparing Him to Melchizedek.

In summary, according to the New Testament, Jesus is described as having a superior priesthood compared to the Old Testament high priests because His ministry is heavenly, based on a better covenant with better promises, and because He himself is the source of that new covenant rather than being an administrator like the earthly high priests. Additionally, His perpetual priesthood is highlighted by the comparison made between Him and Melchizedek.
