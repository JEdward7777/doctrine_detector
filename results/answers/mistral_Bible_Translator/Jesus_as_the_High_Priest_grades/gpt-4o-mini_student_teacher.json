  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of Jesus' unique high priesthood in comparison to the Old Testament high priests based on key passages from the New Testament. The answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the theological implications of Jesus fulfilling the role of high priest. However, the grade is slightly lower than perfect as the student could have directly included the reference answer from the teacher in their response to strengthen their argument."
