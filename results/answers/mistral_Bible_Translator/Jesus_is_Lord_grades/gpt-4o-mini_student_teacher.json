The student effectively emphasizes the spiritual and religious significance of Jesus' lordship. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly stating the distinctiveness of Jesus' divine authority and supremacy over human rulers as the teacher's reference answer highlights. Raising awareness of this crucial distinction would further enhance the clarity in differentiating between Jesus' lordship and earthly titles."
