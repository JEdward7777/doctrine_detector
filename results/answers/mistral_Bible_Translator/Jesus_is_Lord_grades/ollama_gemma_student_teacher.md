 In a context where political leaders are also referred to as "Lord," it would be appropriate to communicate the phrase "Jesus is Lord" by emphasizing the spiritual and religious connotation of the term. Here are some possible ways to express this:

1. "Jesus is our King, not just in a political sense, but spiritually as well."
2. "When we say 'Jesus is Lord,' we mean that He is our ultimate authority and ruler over our lives."
3. "To acknowledge Jesus as Lord means recognizing His supreme rule and reign over us, not just in the religious realm, but in every aspect of life."
4. "Jesus Christ is not simply a political figure, but rather, He is our Savior and King who rules over us with love and grace."
5. "When we say 'Jesus is Lord,' we are affirming that He is our ultimate leader, guiding us in all things, and that our allegiance to Him surpasses any earthly authority."
