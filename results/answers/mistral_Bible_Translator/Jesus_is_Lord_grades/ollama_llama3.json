  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively conveys the idea that \"Jesus is Lord\" signifies His divine authority and supremacy over all creation, distinct from human rulers. It also addresses the concern of clarity by providing alternative ways to express this concept, which helps to differentiate between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. While the response does not directly quote the concern or answer, it implicitly acknowledges it through its explanations. Overall, a solid attempt at conveying the importance of Jesus' lordship and differentiating it from human rulers."
