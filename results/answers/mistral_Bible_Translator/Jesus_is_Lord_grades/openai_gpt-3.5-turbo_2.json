The provided ways to express \"Jesus is Lord\" clearly differentiate between His divine lordship and earthly titles, addressing the concern raised. However, there could be a bit more emphasis on the distinction between human rulers and Jesus as the ultimate authority. Overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview."
