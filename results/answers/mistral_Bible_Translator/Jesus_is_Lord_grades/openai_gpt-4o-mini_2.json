The suggested ways to communicate this phrase emphasize the spiritual and religious connotation, which helps differentiate between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. However, there could be a bit more explicit emphasis on the distinction between Jesus' lordship and political titles to further address the concern raised regarding clarity on this differentiation."
