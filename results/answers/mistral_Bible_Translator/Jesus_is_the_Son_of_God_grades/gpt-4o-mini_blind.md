## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## [Answer](../Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a Muslim context, it would be more appropriate to express the concept in a way that respects Islamic beliefs while also accurately conveying the original meaning as much as possible within the limits of both faiths' theological differences. Here is one possible translation:

"Jesus is a divine messenger sent by God, highly esteemed and exalted above others."

In Islam, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered to be one of the greatest prophets, but he is not regarded as the Son of God. This translation emphasizes his special status while avoiding language that might be seen as contradictory to Islamic teachings. It is important to remember that each faith has its unique beliefs and perspectives, and translations should strive for understanding and respect within those boundaries.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student's answer shows an attempt to respect Islamic beliefs while conveying the concept of Jesus as the Son of God in a Muslim context. The translation provided emphasizes Jesus' special status as a divine messenger without explicitly stating that he is the Son of God, which aligns with Islamic teachings. However, there could have been a clearer distinction between the Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the Islamic belief in Jesus as a prophet, which would have helped to maintain doctrinal correctness more effectively. Additionally, the answer could have incorporated more specific references to Islamic theology to further strengthen the response.
