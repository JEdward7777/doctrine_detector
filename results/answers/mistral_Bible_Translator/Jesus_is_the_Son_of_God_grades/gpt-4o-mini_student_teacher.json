However, the translation provided significantly deviates from the reference answer by not maintaining the original terminology. It does not explicitly use the term \"Son of God,\" which is crucial in accurately representing the Christian belief about Jesus. While sensitivity to Islamic beliefs is important, the translation should aim to preserve the core theological truth of Jesus being the Son of God while providing clarification or context to minimize offense."
