It clearly explains that Jesus is considered a prophet in Islam but not the Son of God, while maintaining the original terminology. The explanation of the theological differences between the two faiths is also well-articulated. Overall, this is a well-written and thoughtful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of both Christianity and Islam."
