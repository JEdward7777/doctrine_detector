While it is important to be sensitive to other faiths, providing clear teaching and context within a Christian worldview is essential when translating such a central and distinct belief like Jesus being the Son of God. This response falls short in fully meeting the concern of maintaining accuracy and explaining the meaning appropriately within a Christian framework."
