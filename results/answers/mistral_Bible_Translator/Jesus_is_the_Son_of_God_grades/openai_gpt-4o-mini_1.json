While it is important to be sensitive to different religious beliefs, the translation should still strive to maintain the core theological truth of Jesus' divinity as the Son of God within a Christian worldview. The response could have included more emphasis on the unique Christian understanding of Jesus' identity while also acknowledging Islamic perspectives."
