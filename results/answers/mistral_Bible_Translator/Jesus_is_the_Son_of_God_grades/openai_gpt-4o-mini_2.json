However, the translation provided deviates from the original terminology and does not fully maintain the Biblical accuracy of the phrase. While it attempts to explain the meaning within the Islamic context, it falls short of providing a clear teaching that aligns with Christian beliefs. More emphasis on maintaining the original terminology and providing a deeper explanation of the concept within a Christian framework would improve the translation."
