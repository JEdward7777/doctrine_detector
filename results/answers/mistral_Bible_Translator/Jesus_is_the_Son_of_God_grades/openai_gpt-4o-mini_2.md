## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Correct Answer
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Stated Concern
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## [Answer](../Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a Muslim context, it would be more appropriate to express the concept in a way that respects Islamic beliefs while also accurately conveying the original meaning as much as possible within the limits of both faiths' theological differences. Here is one possible translation:

"Jesus is a divine messenger sent by God, highly esteemed and exalted above others."

In Islam, Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) is considered to be one of the greatest prophets, but he is not regarded as the Son of God. This translation emphasizes his special status while avoiding language that might be seen as contradictory to Islamic teachings. It is important to remember that each faith has its unique beliefs and perspectives, and translations should strive for understanding and respect within those boundaries.

Grade: 65

Comment: The response acknowledges the importance of respecting Islamic beliefs while translating the concept of Jesus being the Son of God. However, the translation provided deviates from the original terminology and does not fully maintain the Biblical accuracy of the phrase. While it attempts to explain the meaning within the Islamic context, it falls short of providing a clear teaching that aligns with Christian beliefs. More emphasis on maintaining the original terminology and providing a deeper explanation of the concept within a Christian framework would improve the translation.
