The inclusion of key scriptures such as John 3:16, Romans 3:23, Acts 10:43, Revelation 20:12-13, and Matthew 7:21-23 supports the answer effectively. The explanation of the importance of both faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His commandments is doctrinally sound. However, to improve, the response could delve deeper into the concept of grace and how it intersects with judgment, as salvation is ultimately a result of God's grace through faith in Christ rather than works alone."
