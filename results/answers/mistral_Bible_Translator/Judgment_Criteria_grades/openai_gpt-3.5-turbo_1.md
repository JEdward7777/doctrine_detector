# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the biblical perspective, individuals will be judged on the Day of Judgment based on their faith in Jesus Christ and their obedience to His commandments. Here are some key scriptures that support this:

1. John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

2. Romans 3:23 - "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," indicating that all individuals are imperfect and have fallen short of God's perfect standard.

3. Acts 10:43 - "All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."

4. Revelation 20:12-13 - "And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books."

In this passage from Revelation, it's important to note that our actions are recorded (or not recorded) in the "books" mentioned. Those whose names are found in the "Book of Life" will be granted eternal life, and those whose deeds do not merit entry into the "Book of Life" will face God's judgment.

5. Matthew 7:21-23 - "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'"

This passage warns that merely proclaiming faith or performing good deeds is not enough to enter the kingdom of heaven; one must also do the will of God the Father.

In summary, individuals will be judged on the Day of Judgment based on their faith in Jesus Christ and their obedience to His commandments as expressed through their actions and beliefs. Those whose names are found in the "Book of Life" will enter eternal life, while those who do not meet these criteria will face God's judgment.
