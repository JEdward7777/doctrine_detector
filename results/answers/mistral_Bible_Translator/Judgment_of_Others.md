## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the teachings of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament, it is important for individuals to recognize and address their own faults before pointing out the faults of others (Matthew 7:3-5). This principle is often referred to as the "Golden Rule" or the "Plank in Your Own Eye" lesson.

In Matthew 7:3-5, Jesus says: "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye."

This passage encourages humility and self-reflection as a foundation for offering guidance or correction to others. By focusing on our own flaws and shortcomings, we are better equipped to offer help and support to those around us in a spirit of love and compassion, rather than judgment and condemnation.
