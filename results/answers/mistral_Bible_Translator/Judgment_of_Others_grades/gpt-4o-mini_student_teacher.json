  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thorough answer that accurately reflects the teachings of Jesus on the importance of addressing our own faults before pointing out the faults of others. They effectively cited the relevant passage from Matthew 7:3-5 and demonstrated an understanding of the principle of humility and self-reflection. While the reference answer mentioned a slightly different passage from Luke, the student's answer still aligns well with the Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern provided."
