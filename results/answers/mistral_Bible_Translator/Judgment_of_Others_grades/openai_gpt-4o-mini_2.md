## Question [Judgment of Others](../../../questions/Judgment_of_Others.md)
What does Jesus teach us about pointing out the faults of others in relation to our own faults?

Jesus teaches us to first remove the plank from our own eye before pointing out the speck in someone else's eye, reminding us to practice humility and self-reflection (Luke 6:41-42).

## Stated Concern
Criticizing others while ignoring our own faults can reflect hypocrisy and diminish our witness as Christians.

## [Answer](../Judgment_of_Others.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the teachings of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament, it is important for individuals to recognize and address their own faults before pointing out the faults of others (Matthew 7:3-5). This principle is often referred to as the "Golden Rule" or the "Plank in Your Own Eye" lesson.

In Matthew 7:3-5, Jesus says: "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye."

This passage encourages humility and self-reflection as a foundation for offering guidance or correction to others. By focusing on our own flaws and shortcomings, we are better equipped to offer help and support to those around us in a spirit of love and compassion, rather than judgment and condemnation.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of the importance of humility and self-reflection before correcting others, drawing on the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 7:3-5. The link to the concern raised about the potential for hypocrisy and compromised Christian witness is effectively addressed. The only area for improvement would be to correct the reference to Luke 6:41-42, as the correct passage for the discussed teaching is actually Matthew 7:3-5. Overall, a well-written and insightful response.
