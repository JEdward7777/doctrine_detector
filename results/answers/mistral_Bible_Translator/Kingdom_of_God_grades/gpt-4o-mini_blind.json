The emphasis on maintaining the original meaning and consulting with local theologians and scholars is commendable. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the importance of preserving doctrinal accuracy in the translation process to ensure that the essence of God's reign and sovereignty is accurately conveyed. Additionally, incorporating Scriptural references or theological principles supporting the significance of the \"Kingdom of God\" concept would strengthen the response further."
