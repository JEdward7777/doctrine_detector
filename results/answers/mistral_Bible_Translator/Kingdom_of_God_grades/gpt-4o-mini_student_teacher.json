  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's answer shows a thoughtful consideration of cultural adaptation in translation while maintaining the essence of the term \"Kingdom of God.\" However, the concern raised about potentially losing the depth and biblical context by rephrasing is not fully addressed. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' and explaining its spiritual and eschatological significance, which the student's response does not align with completely. Overall, the student's answer is insightful but could be improved by emphasizing the importance of retaining the original term with provided explanations."
