The suggested approach of using descriptive phrases or metaphors, while taking into account the cultural understanding of the audience, may not adequately capture the full biblical richness of the term 'Kingdom of God'. It is important to prioritize preserving the original meaning and depth of biblical terms, especially when translating sacred texts like the Bible."
