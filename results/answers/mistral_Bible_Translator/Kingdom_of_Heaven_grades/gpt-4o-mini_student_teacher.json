  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nWhile the student provides a thorough explanation of the theological and historical significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"Kingdom of Heaven\" in the book of Matthew, they could have been more concise and directly addressed the concern raised. The student's answer could have been improved by focusing more on the unique aspect of Matthew's gospel and how that ties into the theological implications of God's reign. However, the student's answer demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and effectively presents the importance of the term \"heaven\" in conveying Jesus' teachings."
