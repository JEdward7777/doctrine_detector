  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response addresses the concern about understanding unique terminology used in the gospels by discussing the significance of retaining the term \"heaven\" in the phrase \"Kingdom of Heaven\". The writer provides some biblical context, theological implications, and historical context to support their claim that the term is distinctive to Matthew's gospel and conveys specific theological implications regarding God's reign.\n\nThe response is well-organized and clear in its explanation. However, it could be improved by providing more depth and analysis on how this terminology contributes to Jesus' message and what implications it has for the reader. Additionally, some biblical references or quotes would have strengthened the argument.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern and provides some thoughtful insights, but falls short of fully exploring the significance of this terminology in Matthew's gospel."
