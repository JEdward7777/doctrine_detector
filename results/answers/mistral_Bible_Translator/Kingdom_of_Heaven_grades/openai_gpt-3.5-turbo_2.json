The explanation is detailed, supported by biblical and historical context, and effectively conveys the significance of this terminology in conveying Jesus' teachings. The response effectively addresses the concern of understanding unique terminology in the gospels to grasp the intended messages of the biblical authors. Overall, a comprehensive and well-constructed response."
