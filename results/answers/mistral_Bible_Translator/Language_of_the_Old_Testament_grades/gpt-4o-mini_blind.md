## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The vast majority of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, was originally written in Biblical Hebrew, specifically in the Jewish literary language called Classical Hebrew. This includes books like Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, and parts of Esther. A smaller portion of the Old Testament was written in Biblical Aramaic, which is found mainly in the books of Ezra (4:8-6:18; 7:12-26, 44), Daniel (2:4-7:28), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 10:11 and parts of Jeremiah 36).
