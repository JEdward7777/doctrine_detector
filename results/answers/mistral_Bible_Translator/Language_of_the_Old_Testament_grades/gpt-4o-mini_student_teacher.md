## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The vast majority of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, was originally written in Biblical Hebrew, specifically in the Jewish literary language called Classical Hebrew. This includes books like Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, and parts of Esther. A smaller portion of the Old Testament was written in Biblical Aramaic, which is found mainly in the books of Ezra (4:8-6:18; 7:12-26, 44), Daniel (2:4-7:28), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 10:11 and parts of Jeremiah 36).

Grade: 90

Comment: The student provided a thorough and accurate answer, correctly noting that the vast majority of the Old Testament was indeed written in Hebrew and even specifying that it was Classical Hebrew. They also mentioned the inclusion of Aramaic in certain portions of the Old Testament, showing a good level of understanding. However, it would have been ideal for the student to focus more directly on the precise language at hand like the teacher's reference answer.
