The list of books mentioned is impressive, demonstrating a clear understanding of the scope of languages used.\n\nHowever, I deducted 10 points because the response does not explicitly state that \"The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew\" as per the given answer. While it's implied that most of the OT was written in Hebrew, a more direct statement would be more in line with the original question.\n\nNevertheless, the response effectively addresses the concern about understanding the original context of Scripture, highlighting the importance of knowing the languages used in the Old Testament."
