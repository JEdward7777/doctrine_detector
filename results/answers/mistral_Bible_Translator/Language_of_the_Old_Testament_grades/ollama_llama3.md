## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The vast majority of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, was originally written in Biblical Hebrew, specifically in the Jewish literary language called Classical Hebrew. This includes books like Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, and parts of Esther. A smaller portion of the Old Testament was written in Biblical Aramaic, which is found mainly in the books of Ezra (4:8-6:18; 7:12-26, 44), Daniel (2:4-7:28), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 10:11 and parts of Jeremiah 36).

Grade: 90

The response provides accurate information about the languages used in the Old Testament, specifically that the vast majority was written in Biblical Hebrew (Classical Hebrew) and a smaller portion in Biblical Aramaic. The list of books mentioned is impressive, demonstrating a clear understanding of the scope of languages used.

However, I deducted 10 points because the response does not explicitly state that "The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew" as per the given answer. While it's implied that most of the OT was written in Hebrew, a more direct statement would be more in line with the original question.

Nevertheless, the response effectively addresses the concern about understanding the original context of Scripture, highlighting the importance of knowing the languages used in the Old Testament.
