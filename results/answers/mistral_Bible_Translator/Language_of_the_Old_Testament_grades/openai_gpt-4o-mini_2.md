## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The vast majority of the Old Testament, also known as the Hebrew Bible, was originally written in Biblical Hebrew, specifically in the Jewish literary language called Classical Hebrew. This includes books like Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, and parts of Esther. A smaller portion of the Old Testament was written in Biblical Aramaic, which is found mainly in the books of Ezra (4:8-6:18; 7:12-26, 44), Daniel (2:4-7:28), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 10:11 and parts of Jeremiah 36).

Comment: The response accurately expands on the original answer by providing additional detail about the languages in which the Old Testament was written, highlighting the importance of this knowledge for studying the Scriptures in their original context. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly mentioning Aramaic in the initial answer, which would have made the response even more comprehensive.
