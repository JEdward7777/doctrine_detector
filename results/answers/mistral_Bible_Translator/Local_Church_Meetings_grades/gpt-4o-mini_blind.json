It accurately references scriptural passages in Acts 2:42-47 and 1 Corinthians 16:1-2 to support the description of their gatherings for fellowship, teaching, breaking bread, and prayer. The response effectively conveys the importance of these meetings for worship, study, support, and mutual care. Well done!"
