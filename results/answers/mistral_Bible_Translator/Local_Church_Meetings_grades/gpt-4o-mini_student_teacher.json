  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of how early Christian communities typically met according to the New Testament, they did not directly address the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers. The student should have emphasized the importance of meeting in someone's home specifically for prayer and scripture discussion to encourage a closer fellowship among believers. Incorporating this element would have aligned the response more closely with the concern provided."
