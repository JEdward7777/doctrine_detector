# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the New Testament, early Christian communities typically met for fellowship, teaching, breaking bread (communion), and prayer. This practice is described in several books of the New Testament, such as Acts 2:42-47 and 1 Corinthians 16:1-2.

In Acts 2:42-47, it is mentioned that the believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, breaking bread, and prayer. They met daily in the temple courts and in homes.

In 1 Corinthians 16:1-2, Paul encourages the believers in Corinth to collect a financial offering for the poor saints in Jerusalem during the week when he was going to pass by Macedonia. This suggests that they were meeting regularly to discuss matters of importance to the community and to take up collections for the needy.

These meetings provided an opportunity for believers to worship God, study Scripture, encourage one another, pray together, and share their resources with those in need. The exact format and structure of these gatherings may have varied from city to city and from community to community, depending on factors such as the size of the group, cultural customs, and local leadership.
