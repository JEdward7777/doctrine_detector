It goes beyond the given answer to highlight specific examples from the New Testament, showing a strong understanding of fostering local fellowship among believers. The only minor improvement could be to directly tie back the discussion to the importance of encouraging believers to continue practicing and valuing these forms of fellowship in the present-day Christian context."
