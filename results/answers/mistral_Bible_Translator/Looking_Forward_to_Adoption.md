## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the book of Romans, chapter 8, verse 23 says, "And not only that, but we also exult in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."

This verse implies that as believers, we are eagerly awaiting or longing for our adoption as sons, which is symbolic of our glorification and the redemption of our bodies. This is the second blessing (the first being justification) that we receive through faith in Jesus Christ. It signifies our full inheritance as God's children and our ultimate transformation into the likeness of Christ when He returns or at the moment of death for those who are already physically dead.

In essence, this waiting for adoption is a reminder of our hopeful expectation for our final glorification and the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises. It also reminds us that the process of sanctification (growing in holiness) can be difficult, but it produces character and hope in us, which will ultimately lead to our glorious redemption. This verse encourages believers to persevere in their faith and trust in God during times of suffering because our hope in Christ does not disappoint us.
