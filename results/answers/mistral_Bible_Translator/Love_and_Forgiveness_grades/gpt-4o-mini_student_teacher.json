  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer that effectively connects forgiveness to God's love and the importance of forgiveness in relationships. The biblical references and explanations are sound, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the student could have directly addressed the concern by emphasizing how encouraging forgiveness in daily interactions reflects God's love more explicitly. Overall, a strong answer with room for slight improvement in alignment with the concern."
