  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-supported answer from a Christian perspective regarding the significance of the 'bond of marriage' and how couples should view their commitment to each other. The response highlighted important biblical references and principles related to marriage, emphasizing the spiritual aspects of love, faithfulness, and mutual submission. The student effectively connected the bond of marriage to God's design for relationships and the importance of seeking guidance and wisdom from Him. The answer could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern of promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages even more explicitly throughout the response. Overall, a solid understanding and application of Christian principles to the topic of marriage."
