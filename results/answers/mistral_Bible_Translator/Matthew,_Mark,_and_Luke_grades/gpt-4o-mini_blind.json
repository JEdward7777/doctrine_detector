  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and accurate list of the names of the twelve disciples, including additional information about Nathanael being Bartholomew, Thaddaeus being known as Lebbaeus or Judas son of James in other versions, and the replacement of Judas Iscariot by Matthias. The only area for improvement would be to include the additional references for where some disciples are known by different names in other versions, such as Thaddaeus and Lebbaeus/Judas son of James. Overall, a well-detailed and doctrinally sound response."
