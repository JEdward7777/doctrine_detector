  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates some familiarity with the biblical accounts, correctly identifying the three books (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. However, it lacks specificity and detail, not providing the actual names of the disciples as mentioned in the correct passages. To improve, the response could have provided more concrete information about the disciples, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the biblical accounts and their teachings.\n\nThis grade aligns with the concern \"Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings\" because while the response shows some awareness of the biblical accounts, it does not delve deeply into the specific details or teachings found in those accounts."
