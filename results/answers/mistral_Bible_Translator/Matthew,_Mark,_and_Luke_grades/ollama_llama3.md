 The names of the twelve disciples, also known as the Twelve Apostles, are listed in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in three books: Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, and Luke 6:13-16. In these passages, the disciples are named as follows:

1. Simon Peter (Simon called Peter)
2. Andrew his brother
3. James son of Zebedee
4. John his brother
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew (Nathanael in John 1:45-49 and 21:2)
7. Thomas, called the Twin
8. Matthew the tax collector
9. James son of Alphaeus
10. Thaddaeus (Lebbaeus or Judas son of James in other versions)
11. Simon the Zealot
12. Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus. After Judas's betrayal and subsequent death, Matthias was chosen to replace him (Acts 1:26).

Grade: 80

Comment: The response demonstrates some familiarity with the biblical accounts, correctly identifying the three books (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) where the names of the twelve disciples are listed. However, it lacks specificity and detail, not providing the actual names of the disciples as mentioned in the correct passages. To improve, the response could have provided more concrete information about the disciples, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the biblical accounts and their teachings.

This grade aligns with the concern "Being familiar with the Gospel accounts and their teachings" because while the response shows some awareness of the biblical accounts, it does not delve deeply into the specific details or teachings found in those accounts.
