 The names of the twelve disciples, also known as the Twelve Apostles, are listed in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in three books: Matthew 10:2-4, Mark 3:16-19, and Luke 6:13-16. In these passages, the disciples are named as follows:

1. Simon Peter (Simon called Peter)
2. Andrew his brother
3. James son of Zebedee
4. John his brother
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew (Nathanael in John 1:45-49 and 21:2)
7. Thomas, called the Twin
8. Matthew the tax collector
9. James son of Alphaeus
10. Thaddaeus (Lebbaeus or Judas son of James in other versions)
11. Simon the Zealot
12. Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus. After Judas's betrayal and subsequent death, Matthias was chosen to replace him (Acts 1:26).

The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the Gospel accounts and their teachings by accurately presenting the names of the disciples as recorded in Scripture. The only minor improvement could be to briefly explain the significance or roles of these disciples within the context of Jesus' ministry.
