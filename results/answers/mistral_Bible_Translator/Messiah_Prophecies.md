1. Prophecy of the Virgo Birth (Isaiah 7:14): The prophecy states that a virgin will conceive and give birth to a son who will be called Immanuel, meaning "God with us." Jesus was born from the Virgin Mary, fulfilling this prophecy.

2. Prophecy of the Nation (Isaiah 9:6-7): The prophecy foretells a ruler named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace who would be born of the house of David and his kingdom would have no end. Jesus is acknowledged as this ruler and His kingdom shall have no end (Matthew 1:1).

3. Prophecy of the Suffering Servant (Isaiah 52:13-53:12): The prophecy describes a man who would be despised, rejected by men, pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities, and by His wounds we are healed. Jesus was mocked, beaten, falsely accused, condemned, crucified, and rose from the dead, fulfilling this prophecy.

4. Prophecy of Bethlehem (Micah 5:2): The prophecy states that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, a city of Judah. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, fulfilling this prophecy.

5. Prophecy of the Messiah's Genealogy (Genesis 3:15; 49:10; Numbers 24:17): The prophecies establish that the Messiah would be a descendant of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob through Judah. Jesus was born into the lineage of David, who was the son of Jesse, who was the son of Obed, who was the son of Boaz, who was the son of Salmon, who was the son of Nahor, who was the son of Serug, who was the son of Reuel, who was the son of Peleg, who was the son of Heber, who was the son of Shelah, who was the son of Cainan, who was the son of Arphaxad, who was the son of Shem, who was the son of Noah. Jesus' genealogy is traced through Joseph (Matthew 1:1-17), fulfilling these prophecies.

6. Prophecy of the Presentation (Malachi 3:1): The prophecy states that Elijah will appear before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Jesus said John the Baptist was Elijah who was to come (Matthew 11:14). This event is also recorded in Luke 1:17 where it says, "And he will go on ahead of him [Jesus] in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteousâ€”to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."

7. Prophecy of the Passover Lamb (Exodus 12:3-4): The prophecy describes how the Israelites were to sacrifice a lamb without blemish and put its blood on their doorposts so that the angel of death would pass over them. Jesus, who is called "the Lamb of God" (John 1:29), fulfilled this prophecy by dying as the sinless sacrifice that saves us from spiritual death.

8. Prophecy of the Messiah's Entry into Jerusalem (Zechariah 9:9): The prophecy foretells that the Messiah would enter Jerusalem on a donkey, and all the nations would be gathered against Him. Jesus entered Jerusalem on a donkey, fulfilling this prophecy (Matthew 21:5).

These Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah have been fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ.
