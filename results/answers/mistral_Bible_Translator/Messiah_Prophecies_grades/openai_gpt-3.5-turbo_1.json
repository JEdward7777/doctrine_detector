By highlighting specific prophecies such as the Virgin Birth, lineage of King David, suffering servant, birth in Bethlehem, genealogy, presentation, Passover Lamb, and entry into Jerusalem, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of how these prophecies point to Jesus. The connection between the prophecies and Jesus' fulfillment strengthens faith in Him as the Messiah, affirming the Christian worldview.
