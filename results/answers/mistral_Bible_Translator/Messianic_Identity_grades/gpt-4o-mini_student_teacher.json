  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a solid understanding of the significance of the title \"King of the Jews\" in relation to Jesus' identity as the Messiah. They provided a comprehensive explanation linking the title to Old Testament prophecies and the New Testament context. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly tying Jesus' role as the promised Messiah to being a descendant of King David and emphasizing the eternal nature of His reign, as mentioned in the reference answer."
