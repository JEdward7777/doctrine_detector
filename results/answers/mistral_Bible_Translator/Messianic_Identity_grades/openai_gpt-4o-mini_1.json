It effectively connects the Old Testament prophecies about a Jewish king with Jesus' acknowledgment of the title during His trial. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of Jesus' messianic role and how it is central to the Christian faith. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention Jesus' lineage from King David, as this is significant in establishing His rightful claim to the title \"King of the Jews.\""
