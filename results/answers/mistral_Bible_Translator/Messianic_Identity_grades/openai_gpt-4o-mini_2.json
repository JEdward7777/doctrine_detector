It effectively connects the Old Testament prophecies regarding a future Jewish king with Jesus' response during His trial and the implications of acknowledging Him as the promised Messiah. The explanation aligns well with the concern that understanding Jesus' messianic role is central to the Christian faith, illustrating the importance of this title in Christian theology."
