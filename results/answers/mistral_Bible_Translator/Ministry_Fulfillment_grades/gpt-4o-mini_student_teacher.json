  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated answer highlighting key biblical principles related to fulfilling one's ministry as a Christian. They have effectively tied in relevant Bible verses to support their points. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the core concept of completing the calling God has placed on one's life to serve others, as stated in the reference answer. This central idea should be emphasized more prominently throughout the response."
