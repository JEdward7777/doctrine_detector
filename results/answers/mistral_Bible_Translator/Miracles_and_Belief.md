## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Miracles, according to Christian theology, serve as powerful demonstrations of God's power and sovereignty over the world He created. They are designed to draw attention to God and His message, often serving as a bridge between the natural and supernatural realms. Through miracles, God validates His messengers, affirms His truth, and reveals aspects of His character to those who witness or experience them.

In this sense, miracles function as signs that lead to belief in God by providing evidence for His existence, providence, and concern for humanity. As recorded in the Bible, Jesus frequently performed miracles to verify his identity as the Messiah and to demonstrate the reality of God's love and power (John 20:30-31). These miracles were not merely entertaining or unusual events but rather were intended to inspire faith in the one true God.

The response to a miracle, however, is ultimately up to each individual. The Bible records instances where people witnessed miracles yet continued to disbelieve (John 12:37), while others responded with faith and devotion (Matthew 8:10). Ultimately, the purpose of miracles as signs is not only to provide evidence for God's existence but also to prompt people to engage with Him on a personal level and come to a deeper understanding of His character and nature.
