It effectively connects the role of miracles to validating the ministry of prophets and apostles. The Christian perspective on the significance of miracles in leading others to faith is clearly articulated. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the pivotal role of personal faith and engagement with God in response to witnessing miracles. Overall, a strong and insightful analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
