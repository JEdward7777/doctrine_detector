## Question [Multiple gods](../../../questions/Multiple_gods.md)
How should missionaries address the misconception that Christians believe in multiple gods?

## Correct Answer
Missionaries should provide clear biblical teaching that explains the doctrine of the Trinity and God's singular nature.

## Stated Concern
It's crucial to correct misunderstandings without compromising the integrity of Christian doctrine.

## [Answer](../Multiple_gods.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 As a Christian Bible translator, it is important to clarify that Christians do not believe in multiple gods. Instead, we believe in one God who exists eternally in three persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. This concept is known as the Trinity, which is central to Christian faith.

In the Old Testament, God often refers to himself using plural pronouns such as "us" and "we," but these are understood as a representation of His self-existence and not an indication of multiple gods (Genesis 1:26, Isaiah 48:16). In the New Testament, Jesus Christ explicitly states that He and the Father are one (John 10:30), and the apostle Paul explains the concept of the Holy Spirit as part of the Godhead (1 Corinthians 12:4-6).

Therefore, when addressing this misconception, missionaries should emphasize the biblical teaching on the unity and triunity of God. They can share passages from the Bible that reveal the one true God and His three distinct persons, and explain how each person shares in the divine nature while remaining distinct from one another. By doing so, missionaries can help dispel any misunderstandings about Christian belief in multiple gods.
