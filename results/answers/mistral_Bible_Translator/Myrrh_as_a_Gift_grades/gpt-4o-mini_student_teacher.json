  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed explanation of the significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth. They effectively connected the symbolism of myrrh to Jesus' humanity, future suffering, royalty, and priesthood. The student's answer shows a deep understanding of the biblical context and the implications of the gift of myrrh, aligning closely with the Christian worldview in interpreting its meaning in relation to Jesus as the Messiah. The student could have slightly improved by linking the symbolism more directly to Jesus' sacrificial death, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer."
