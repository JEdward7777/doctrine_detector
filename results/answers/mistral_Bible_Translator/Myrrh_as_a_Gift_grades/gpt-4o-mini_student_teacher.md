## [Answer](../Myrrh_as_a_Gift.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Myrrh, along with gold and frankincense, was one of the gifts presented by the Magi or Wise Men to Jesus at His birth, as recorded in Matthew 2:11. The symbolic significance of myrrh is found in its biblical context, which includes use as an aromatic perfume, an ingredient for holy anointing oil, and a component in embalming mixtures.

In the New Testament, myrrh is often associated with suffering and death. For example, Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh to ease His pain on the cross (Mark 15:23). It can be seen that the offering of myrrh by the Magi may have symbolized both the earthly kingship and divine nature of Jesus as well as the future suffering He would endure. Additionally, it serves as a reminder of Jesus' humanity, emphasizing His birth and connection to humanity while also foreshadowing His sacrificial death for the redemption of mankind.

Furthermore, in Old Testament prophecy, myrrh is mentioned among the gifts offered to the Messiah (Isaiah 60:6) as a sign of His royal and priestly status. The gift of myrrh by the Magi acknowledged Jesus' role as both King and Savior.

In summary, the offering of myrrh at Jesus' birth was significant in that it symbolized His humanity, future suffering, royalty, and priesthood, confirming His identity as the Messiah promised in the Old Testament.
