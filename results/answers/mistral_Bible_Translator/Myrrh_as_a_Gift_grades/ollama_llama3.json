  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response accurately identifies the symbolic significance of myrrh, highlighting its connection to suffering and death, as well as Jesus' role as the Messiah who would be sacrificed for humanity's sins. The author also provides relevant biblical context and examples, such as Jesus being offered wine mixed with myrrh on the cross, which supports their interpretation.\n\nThe response also effectively addresses the concern of understanding the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus, demonstrating how this understanding can deepen one's appreciation of his purpose and mission.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that some of the supporting biblical examples and connections are not fully developed or explicitly stated. For instance, the author mentions Isaiah 60:6 as an Old Testament prophecy mentioning myrrh, but doesn't explicitly state how this passage relates to Jesus' identity as Messiah. Additionally, while the response does touch on the idea of Jesus' humanity being emphasized by the gift of myrrh, it could be further developed and connected more explicitly to Jesus' mission.\n\nOverall, however, the response provides a clear and thoughtful exploration of the symbolism of myrrh in relation to Jesus' birth and purpose."
