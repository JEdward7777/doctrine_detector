  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of how Jesus is described as the image of God in Christian belief. The student effectively references relevant passages from the New Testament and elaborates on the significance of Jesus being the image of God in terms of revelation, redemption, transformation, and hope. The response could be further strengthened by delving into the theological implications of Jesus being the image of God in relation to the doctrine of the Trinity and the hypostatic union."
