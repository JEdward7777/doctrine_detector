  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of how Jesus is described as the image of God in Christian belief, citing relevant biblical passages and discussing the significance in terms of revelation, redemption, transformation, and hope. However, the student's answer lacks a clear emphasis on Jesus being God himself and sharing the same essence with God the Father, which is a crucial aspect emphasized in Christian theology. This connection to Jesus' divinity could have been highlighted more explicitly in the response."
