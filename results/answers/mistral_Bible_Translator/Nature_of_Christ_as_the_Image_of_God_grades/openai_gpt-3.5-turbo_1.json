  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of Jesus being the image of God in Christian theology, highlighting key biblical passages and the implications of this concept for believers. However, the specific concern raised in the answer is not directly addressed in the student's response. The student's answer emphasizes Jesus' divinity and role in salvation, which are important aspects of Christology, but does not delve into the concept of Jesus as the perfect representation of God's nature and character. A more explicit connection to the theological understanding of Christ's nature in relation to God would have strengthened the response."
