  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of Jesus being the image of God within Christian theology, highlighting key passages and aspects of significance.

Incorporating more direct references to Jesus' deity would strengthen the theological understanding presented."
