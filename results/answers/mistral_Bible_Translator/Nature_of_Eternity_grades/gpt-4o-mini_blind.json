  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a clear and concise explanation of how eternity is defined in the context of Christian beliefs. The student accurately captures the Christian understanding of eternity as an endless, timeless existence without beginning or end, supported by relevant Bible verses. The mention of God's eternal nature, Heaven, and Hell in relation to eternity is doctrinally correct. The language used is appropriate, and the overall response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. Great job!"
