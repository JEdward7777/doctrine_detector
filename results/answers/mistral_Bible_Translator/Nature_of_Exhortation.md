 According to the New Testament, Christians should approach exhortation (or encouragement and instruction) in a manner that reflects God's love, patience, and grace. Here are some key principles for Christian exhortation as demonstrated in the New Testament:

1. With Humility: As the apostle Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians 10:8, "We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!" Exhortation should come from a place of humility rather than pride or arrogance.

2. With Love: Jesus commanded His followers to love one another as He loved them (John 13:34). This love is not just an emotion but involves acting selflessly, sacrificially, and patiently towards others. Exhortation should be offered with a heart of love and concern for the spiritual growth and wellbeing of the recipient.

3. With Gentleness and Respect: Peter wrote in 1 Peter 3:15, "But in your hearts revere Christ as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect." Exhortation should be offered gently, not harshly or forcefully. It should also demonstrate respect for the other person's dignity and intelligence.

4. With Patience: Paul exhorted the Galatians to bear one another's burdens, and in doing so fulfill the law of Christ (Galatians 6:2). This requires patience, as growth may be slow and challenging for some individuals. Exhortation should not be offered impatiently or with a sense of frustration but instead with understanding and empathy.

5. With Truth: Jesus said, "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free" (John 8:32). Exhortation should always be rooted in biblical truth and aimed at helping others grow in their relationship with God and in obedience to His word.

6. With Grace: The apostle Paul wrote to the Colossians, "For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the Spirit gives, so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God" (Colossians 1:9-10). Exhortation should be offered with grace, recognizing that growth is a process and that the recipient is loved by God regardless of their current state.

7. With Encouragement: The apostle Paul wrote to the Romans, "Therefore, encourage one another and build each other up" (1 Thessalonians 5:11). Exhortation should not only address areas for growth but also acknowledge the progress that has been made and encourage continued faithfulness in following Christ.

By adhering to these principles, Christians can approach exhortation in a way that is faithful to the teachings of the New Testament and reflects the love, grace, and patience of God.
