  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured response connecting Jesus's teachings on forgiveness to the character of God the Father, highlighting aspects of love, mercy, and compassion. However, the answer could have been strengthened by directly addressing the specific point that forgiveness should flow from our hearts to reflect God's nature of grace and mercy, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer. Deepening the analysis by explicitly drawing this connection would have enhanced the student's response."
