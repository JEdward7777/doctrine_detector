It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the moral and relational attributes of God as revealed through these teachings. The integration of biblical references and the parable of the Unmerciful Servant enriches the explanation. Great job connecting Jesus's teachings to the nature of God in a Christian worldview perspective."
