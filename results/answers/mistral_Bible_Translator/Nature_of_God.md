## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In John 4:24, Jesus says, "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." This statement indicates that God is not physical or tangible but spiritual in nature. He is not confined to a particular place or form, which sets Him apart from created beings.

Regarding the influence on our worship, this verse suggests that our worship should be spiritual rather than materialistic. Instead of focusing on physical symbols, structures, or rituals, we should aim to connect with God at a deeper, more spiritual level. Worshipping in spirit implies a sincere and heartfelt approach towards God.

Additionally, the phrase "and in truth" underscores the importance of genuine faith. Our worship should be based on truth, as revealed in the Bible. This means that our understanding of who God is and what He requires from us must be rooted in biblical teachings rather than human traditions or personal interpretations.

In summary, when Jesus said that God is a spirit, it emphasizes the need for spiritual worship, characterized by sincerity, honesty, and a connection with God that goes beyond physical rituals or structures.
