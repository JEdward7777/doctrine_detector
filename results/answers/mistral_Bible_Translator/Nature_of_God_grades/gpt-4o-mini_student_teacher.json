  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the essence of God as a spirit and how it influences worship. They effectively highlighted the need for spiritual worship and emphasized sincerity, honesty, and a connection with God beyond physical rituals. The answer aligns closely with the reference answer, but could have further emphasized the significance of spiritual engagement in worship and the transcendent nature of God."
