  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of the Biblical teachings on hell, covering key aspects such as separation from God, judgment, punishment, irreversibility, free will, and mentioning the minority view of universal reconciliation. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic with appropriate references to relevant Bible verses. However, to improve the grade, the student could delve deeper into the doctrinal implications and theological significance of hell in the Christian faith. Additionally, providing more clarity on the contrasting views within Christianity regarding the nature of hell would enhance the answer."
