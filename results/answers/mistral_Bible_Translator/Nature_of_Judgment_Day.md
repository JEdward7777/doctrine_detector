## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a Christian context, Judgment Day refers to the final event in human history as described in the Bible, when God will pass judgment on all people who have ever lived. It is also known as the "Day of the Lord," "Last Day," or the "Great White Throne Judgment."

The concept is introduced in the Old Testament (e.g., Malachi 4:5) and is further developed in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospels (Matthew 25:31-46, for example), Paul's letters (e.g., 2 Corinthians 5:10), and in Revelation (e.g., Revelation 20:11-15). On Judgment Day, Jesus Christ will return to earth as the final judge, and each person will be judged according to their actions and faith during their life on earth. Those who have accepted Jesus as their savior and lived in accordance with His teachings will receive eternal life in heaven, while those who have not will be sentenced to eternal separation from God, often referred to as hell.

It's important to note that the Bible does not provide specific details about when Judgment Day will occur. Christians believe it is an event that will happen one day, but no one knows the exact timing. It serves as a call for individuals to accept Jesus as their savior and live according to His teachings in the meantime.

The primary purpose of discussing Judgment Day within Christian theology is to emphasize the importance of making personal faith decisions, living with integrity, and spreading the message of salvation through Jesus Christ to others before it's too late.
