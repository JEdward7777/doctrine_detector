## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible describes the appearance and taste of manna in Exodus 16:31, where it says, "And the house of Israel called its name Manna; and it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey." This description indicates that the manna had a grain-like appearance, resembling coriander seeds, and a sweet taste similar to honey wafers. However, it is important to note that this description may not be entirely accurate for modern readers, as the exact taste and texture of manna experienced by the Israelites in the wilderness may have been influenced by their cultural context and historical circumstances.
