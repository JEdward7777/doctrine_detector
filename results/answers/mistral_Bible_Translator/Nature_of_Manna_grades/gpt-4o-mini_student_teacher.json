  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student accurately referenced the description of manna in Exodus 16:31 and provided relevant details regarding its appearance and taste. However, the concern of understanding the miraculous provision of God could have been further emphasized to connect the significance of manna as a divine provision to the Israelites in the wilderness. It would have been beneficial for the student to integrate more explicitly how the manna served as a miraculous intervention by God to meet the needs of His people."
