However, the concern regarding understanding the miraculous provision of God could have been further emphasized to highlight the significance of manna as a supernatural provision rather than just a mere description of its physical attributes. Some additional insights from a Christian worldview on the divine nature of manna and its role in demonstrating God's faithfulness and provision could have strengthened the response."
