However, the concern of understanding the miraculous provision of God could be further emphasized by highlighting the significance of manna as a supernatural provision from God to sustain the Israelites in the wilderness. Integrating more explicitly how manna points to God's faithfulness and provision for His people would strengthen the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
