The student accurately references relevant Bible verses to support their points and concludes with a strong call to resist temptation through renewing our minds with God's Word and relying on the Holy Spirit's power. The only room for improvement would be to perhaps elaborate further on how external influences can shape and intensify our sinful nature's predispositions towards temptation."
