  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively identifies both internal (sinful nature) and external factors that contribute to temptation, which aligns well with Christian teaching as presented in the Bible. The inclusion of specific biblical references, such as Romans 7:23 and Mark 7:21, adds depth and credibility to the argument. Additionally, the conclusion provides a clear call to action, encouraging readers to resist temptations through renewing their minds and relying on the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are minor, such as:\n\n* The response could have more clearly distinguished between the roles of internal (sinful nature) and external influences in temptation.\n* Some of the biblical references, although accurate, could be further contextualized or analyzed to provide even greater insight into Christian teaching on the topic.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a good understanding of Christian teaching on the sources and reasons for temptation."
