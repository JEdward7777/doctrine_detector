  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and accurate explanation of various ways individuals can be considered \"wicked\" according to the Bible, supported by relevant scripture references. The response effectively connects these actions to the concept of wickedness and highlights the consequences of such behavior. Additionally, the inclusion of the solution through faith in Jesus Christ and repentance aligns well with the Christian worldview. Great job overall."
