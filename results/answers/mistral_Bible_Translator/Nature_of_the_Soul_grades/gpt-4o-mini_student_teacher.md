## [Answer](../Nature_of_the_Soul.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, both "soul" (Hebrew: nefesh, ruach; Greek: psyche, pneuma) are used to describe fundamental aspects of human beings, but they have distinct connotations.

The term "soul" (nefesh, psyche) generally refers to the inner self, the seat of emotions, desires, and sensations, including physical feelings and appetites. It represents life in the physical sense and can be linked to the body's vital functions. In some cases, it is used figuratively to represent a person as a whole or their identity.

The term "spirit" (ruach, pneuma) carries a broader meaning and often refers to the non-physical part of human beings. It represents the ethical and spiritual aspect of our nature, which God imbues within us at creation. It is closely associated with the concept of the image of God in humanity (Genesis 1:26-27). The spirit is immortal, capable of communication with God, and can be indwelt by the Holy Spirit upon conversion.

Although there is some overlap between the two terms, they are used to emphasize different aspects of our being as created in God's image â€“ physical (soul) and spiritual (spirit).
