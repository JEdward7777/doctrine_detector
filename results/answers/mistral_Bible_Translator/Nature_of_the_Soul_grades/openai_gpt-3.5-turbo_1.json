  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Biblical definitions of \"soul\" and \"spirit\" and effectively distinguishes between the two terms based on their distinct connotations. It correctly emphasizes the importance of understanding these definitions for accurate interpretation of scripture regarding human nature and relationship with God. The integration of a Christian worldview is strong in this response. The only improvement would be to include more specific biblical references to support the explanations given."
