## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In accordance with the book of Numbers, chapter 6 verses 1-4, a person taking the Nazirite vow binds himself to abstain from several specific practices:

1. No contact with a dead body: The Nazirite is forbidden from coming into contact with any corpse, whether that of a relative or not (verse 6). This includes funeral rites.

2. Avoidance of wine and other grape products: The Nazirite cannot drink wine or any other alcoholic beverage made from grapes or eat grapes themselves (verses 3 and 5). Also, no fermented grape juice may touch the Nazirite's lips.

3. Abstinence from cutting the hair: For the duration of the vow, the Nazirite cannot cut their hair. The intention is to let it grow out (verse 5). After completing the vow, the hair is then to be shaved off and burned as a separate offering to God (verses 9-10).

4. Avoidance of any substances derived from vineyards: In addition to wine and grapes, the Nazirite must avoid all products made from grapevines, such as seed or skins (verse 3).

5. The vow is only taken voluntarily: A Nazirite takes the vow by declaring a personal commitment before God through a specific set of words found in Numbers 6:2-3. This vow can be for an individual or for a lifetime, as seen with figures like Samuel and John the Baptist (1 Samuel 1:11; Luke 1:15).

Once the Nazirite completes their vow, they may then return to their normal life, resuming all activities that were previously prohibited by the vow. It is essential to note that the Nazirite vow is a personal commitment between an individual and God and not commanded in the Law as an obligatory practice for all believers.
