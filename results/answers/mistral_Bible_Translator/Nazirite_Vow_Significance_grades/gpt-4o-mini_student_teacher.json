  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the key restrictions associated with the Nazirite vow as described in Numbers 6:1-4. They accurately outlined the restrictions and provided additional context surrounding the vow, including its voluntary nature and examples from the Bible. However, the student's response went beyond the specific restrictions mentioned in the reference answer, which could be seen as not directly addressing the concern of understanding the purpose and significance of the Nazirite vow."
