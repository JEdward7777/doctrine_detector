  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a solid answer discussing the significance of Psalms in the New Testament for Christians. They correctly highlighted the importance of Psalms in understanding God's character, human emotions, prayer, and worship. The student also cited instances where Jesus and the epistles referenced the Psalms, showing its relevance in the New Testament. The emphasis on studying and reflecting on the Psalms for spiritual growth was appropriate. However, to improve the answer, the student could have delved deeper into specific instructions or exhortations regarding Psalms in the New Testament."
