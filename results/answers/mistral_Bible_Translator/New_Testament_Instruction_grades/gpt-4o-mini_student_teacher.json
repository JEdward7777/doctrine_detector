  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the importance of the Psalms in the New Testament and how they are referenced throughout different books. They correctly highlighted the value of the Psalms in understanding God's character, human emotions, prayer, praise, and worship. However, the student missed the specific instruction given in the New Testament about singing psalms to God as a form of worship, which was the focus of the question. This aspect is crucial in understanding how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship. Overall, a solid response with good insights, but lacking in addressing the specific instruction highlighted in the reference answer."
