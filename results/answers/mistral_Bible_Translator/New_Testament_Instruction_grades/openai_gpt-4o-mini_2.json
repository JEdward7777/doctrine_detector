It effectively connects the use of Psalms in the New Testament, especially in relation to Jesus' ministry and the epistles. The suggestion to approach the study of Psalms within the context of the entire Bible and under spiritual guidance demonstrates a holistic understanding of biblical teachings in contemporary Christian worship."
