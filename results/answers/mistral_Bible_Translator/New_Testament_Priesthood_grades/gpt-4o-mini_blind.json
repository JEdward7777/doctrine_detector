  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament, citing relevant scripture passages. They correctly emphasized the transformation of priesthood from the Old Testament to the New Testament and highlighted the direct access believers have to God through Jesus Christ. The answer could have been strengthened by further elaborating on the specific duties and privileges of being a priest in the New Testament context."
