## Question [New Testament Priesthood](../../../questions/New_Testament_Priesthood.md)
What does it mean for every believer in Jesus to be considered a priest in the New Testament?

## Correct Answer
Every believer in Jesus is considered a priest who can come directly to God in prayer to intercede for themselves and others, reflecting the priesthood of all believers.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers

## [Answer](../New_Testament_Priesthood.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, the concept of priesthood undergoes a significant transformation from the Old Testament. The Book of Hebrews (4:14-16) explains that because of Jesus' sacrifice and ministry, believers in Him have access to God directly, without needing an earthly high priest. This does not mean that every Christian becomes a ceremonial priest, but rather that each believer is considered a spiritual or royal priest (1 Peter 2:5,9).

This priesthood of all believers denotes that individuals can approach God personally and offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to Him through Jesus Christ. This idea emphasizes the shared responsibility of every Christian in worshiping God, interceding for one another, and serving as witnesses of Christ's love in their communities (Revelation 1:6). The priesthood of all believers affirms that each person has a vital role in the body of Christ, which is the Church.
