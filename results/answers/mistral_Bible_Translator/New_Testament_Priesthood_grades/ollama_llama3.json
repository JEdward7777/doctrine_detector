  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response accurately reflects the concept of the priesthood of all believers, highlighting that every believer has direct access to God through Jesus Christ. It also mentions the importance of intercession and worship in one's personal relationship with God. The mention of Revelation 1:6 is particularly relevant, as it underscores the notion that each Christian has a vital role in serving as a witness for Christ.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not fully develop the idea of spiritual sacrifices and how this shared responsibility manifests in daily life. While it touches on worshiping God and interceding for others, it could benefit from more concrete examples or applications of what this looks like practically.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept, but could be further strengthened by providing more depth and practical implications."
