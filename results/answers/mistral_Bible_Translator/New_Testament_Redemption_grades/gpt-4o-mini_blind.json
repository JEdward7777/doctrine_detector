The explanation is clear and supported by relevant biblical references. However, to strengthen the answer, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Jesus's sacrifice and the role of the Holy Spirit in the process of purification. Additionally, connecting the concept of purification to broader theological themes such as redemption and sanctification would have further enriched the response."
