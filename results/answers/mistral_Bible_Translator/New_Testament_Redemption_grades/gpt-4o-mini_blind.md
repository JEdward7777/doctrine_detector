## [Answer](../New_Testament_Redemption.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, purification was primarily focused on ceremonial and physical cleansing, often involving rituals, sacrifices, and specific laws regarding diet, hygiene, and social interactions (e.g., Leviticus 14). These rules were essential for maintaining a proper relationship with God and ensuring the Israelites' holiness and separation from the surrounding cultures.

In contrast, the New Testament introduces a shift in focus from external purification to internal purification, emphasizing spiritual cleansing through faith in Jesus Christ (Acts 22:16; Hebrews 9:13-14). In the New Testament, sin is not merely an external transgression but an inner corruption that affects one's relationship with God. Therefore, purification becomes a matter of the heart rather than just adhering to external rules (Matthew 15:8-9; Mark 7:6).

Jesus' sacrifice on the cross and His resurrection provide the means for spiritual cleansing, making it possible for believers to be declared righteous before God (Romans 3:21-24, 5:9). The Holy Spirit is then sent to indwell each believer, enabling them to live a life pleasing to God and empowering them to overcome sin (Romans 8:1-17; Galatians 5:16-25).

This shift in the concept of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament is an important part of understanding the transition from the Law of Moses to grace through faith in Jesus Christ.

Comment: The response provides a solid overview of how the concept of purification changes from the Old Testament to the New Testament, emphasizing the shift from external to internal purification through faith in Jesus Christ. The explanation is clear and supported by relevant biblical references. However, to strengthen the answer, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of Jesus's sacrifice and the role of the Holy Spirit in the process of purification. Additionally, connecting the concept of purification to broader theological themes such as redemption and sanctification would have further enriched the response.
