  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the shift in the concept of purification from the Old Testament to the New Testament, emphasizing the centrality of Christ's sacrifice for eternal purification from sin. The student effectively explains how the focus moves from external rituals to internal transformation through faith in Jesus Christ. The response is well-supported with relevant biblical references and aligns closely with the teacher's reference answer. Great job!"
