The integration of relevant biblical references and the focus on internal purification through faith in Jesus Christ align well with a Christian worldview. The only minor room for improvement would be to incorporate more direct references to the sufficiency of Christ\u2019s sacrifice throughout the response to further reinforce its centrality in the purification process."
