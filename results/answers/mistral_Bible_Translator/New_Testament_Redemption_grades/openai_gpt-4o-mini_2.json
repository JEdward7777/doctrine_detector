  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern regarding the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the shift in focus from external to internal purification in the New Testament and emphasizes the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for spiritual cleansing. The incorporation of relevant biblical references further strengthens the argument. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the importance of repentance in addition to trust in Jesus for receiving the benefits of His sacrifice. Overall, a well-written and insightful response from a Christian worldview perspective."
