  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the potential connections between John the Baptist and Nazirite practices based on relevant New Testament passages. The student correctly points out that while there are suggestive elements, there is no explicit confirmation that John the Baptist was a Nazirite in the strict biblical sense. The student's explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the topic, but could benefit from further depth in integrating more specific biblical references and theological insights related to Nazirite vows and their implications."
