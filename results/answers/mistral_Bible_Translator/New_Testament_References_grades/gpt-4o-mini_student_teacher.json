  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student has provided a well-reasoned response that makes strong connections between the New Testament passages and the Old Testament Nazirite vow. They have correctly highlighted relevant verses, such as Luke 1:13, to support their argument. However, the student could have strengthened their argument by emphasizing the significance of the angel's announcement to Zechariah, as this is the specific evidence provided by the teacher's reference answer. Additionally, the student could have explored further connections between John the Baptist's actions and the Nazirite vow to enhance their argument. Overall, the student has demonstrated a good understanding of the question and provided a coherent response."
