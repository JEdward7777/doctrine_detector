  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful and thorough analysis of the textual evidence relevant to the question. They correctly point out that the New Testament does not explicitly state that John the Baptist was a Nazirite, but that certain passages suggest he may have adhered to certain aspects of the vow. The student also acknowledges the need for definitive evidence and avoids speculative conclusions. While the reference answer provided by the teacher offers an interpretation based on a specific passage, the student's response demonstrates a broader understanding of the relevant biblical material."
