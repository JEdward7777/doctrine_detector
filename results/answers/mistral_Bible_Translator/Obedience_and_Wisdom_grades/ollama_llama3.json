  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThis response effectively captures the Christian perspective on wisdom, highlighting the importance of listening to God and obeying His will as key components in becoming wise. The inclusion of specific biblical passages adds credibility and depth to the argument. The connection made between obedience and wisdom is also well-articulated, emphasizing the integral role of humility in this process.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to further develop the idea that seeking a close relationship with God through prayer, meditation on His word, and obedience enables individuals to grow in wisdom. While the response touches on this concept, it could be expanded upon to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how Christians can cultivate wisdom in their daily lives.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong grasp of Christian theology and its application to the pursuit of wisdom, making it an excellent example of a well-articulated answer."
