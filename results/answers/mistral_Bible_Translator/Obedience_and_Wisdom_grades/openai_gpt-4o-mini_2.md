 In Christian theology, wisdom is often seen as a divine gift and a virtue that comes from a close relationship with God. Listening to God (commonly referred to as "hearing the voice of God" or "discerning His will") is considered crucial in the pursuit of wisdom. Here are a few key biblical passages that illustrate this idea:

1. Proverbs 1:5,7 - "Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance – For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding."

2. Proverbs 2:1-6 - "My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments within you, making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures – then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God."

3. Proverbs 8:22-31 - This passage personifies Wisdom (a divine attribute) as a female figure who was present with God at creation, emphasizing that she has been acquainted with God's works since their very beginning.

4. James 1:5 - "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him."

By seeking a close relationship with God through prayer, meditation on His word, and obedience, Christians believe that they can grow in wisdom as they listen to His guidance. This wisdom enables them to discern right from wrong, make wise decisions, and live a life pleasing to God. It's important to note that wisdom, according to Christian theology, goes hand-in-hand with humility and obedience.
