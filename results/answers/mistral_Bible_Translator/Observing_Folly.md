## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1. Wisdom and Folly (Proverbs 9): In Proverbs 9, wisdom is personified as a woman who invites others to choose her path of life, which leads to understanding, knowledge, and long life. Folly, on the other hand, is personified as another woman who offers immediate gratification but leads to death. The actions that follow folly are listed throughout the chapter, such as refusing instruction, forsaking knowledge, and preferring sin to obedience.

2. Lack of Wisdom (Proverbs 14:7-9): Actions such as avoiding discipline (v. 7), making a mockery of righteousness (v. 8), and being foolish and unlearned (v. 9) are considered folly.

3. Pride (Proverbs 16:18, 26:12): Pride is an arrogance that leads to destruction (Proverbs 16:18). The Proverb in 26:12 states that it is a snare for the fool to continue ruling over a city.

4. Lack of Prudence (Proverbs 27:12): Foolish actions are those that lack prudence or discretion, such as being quick-tempered and hasty in speech (v. 12).

5. Idleness (Proverbs 19:15, 24:30-34): Being lazy, indolent, or sluggish are all considered folly (v. 15, 24:30). The Proverb in 24:33-34 adds that the work of a sluggard is as nothing; it only takes away his life (v. 33-34).

6. Lack of Righteousness (Proverbs 10:3, 12:9): Folly is also characterized by unrighteous actions, such as making plans without God and denying justice to the oppressed (v. 3). In Proverbs 12:9, a righteous man will avoid evil, but a wicked man hides it.

7. Covetousness (Proverbs 28:22): Actions driven by greed or excess material desires are considered folly. The more one amasses wealth through injustice and dishonesty, the more trouble they bring upon themselves (v. 22).

8. Disregard for God's Word (Proverbs 1:26-33): Folly is also demonstrated by those who reject instruction from God's word, as shown in Proverbs 1:26-33. These individuals scoff at wisdom and reject the path of righteousness that leads to life.

9. Lack of Counsel (Proverbs 15:22): A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his own opinion (v. 22). This lack of humility and desire for counsel leads to folly.

10. Wrongdoing (Isaiah 32:5-6): In Isaiah 32:5-6, the prophet speaks of righteousness being exalted, while wickedness is banished forever from the people. Those who practice deceit and injustice are categorized as fools.
