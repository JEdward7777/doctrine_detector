  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided an excellent and thorough response citing various passages from the Book of Proverbs and Isaiah that clearly outline actions categorized as folly in the Bible. By grounding their answer in scripture, the student demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on folly. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly tie each listed action to the overarching theme that actions categorized as folly are against God\u2019s will, as stated in the reference answer. Overall, this response shows a deep engagement with the biblical text and its teachings on folly."
