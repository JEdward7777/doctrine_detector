 In the Old Testament, priests carried out their ministry primarily within the Temple, which was considered God's dwelling place among His people (Exodus 25:8). Their duties were extensive and essential for maintaining a right relationship between God and Israel. Here are some key aspects of their ministry:

1. Offerings and sacrifices: Priests were responsible for performing various offerings and sacrifices on behalf of the people. These offerings included burnt offerings, grain offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings (Leviticus 1-7). Each type had specific requirements and was performed to atone for sins or express thankfulness to God.

2. Daily tasks: Priests were required to perform daily rituals within the Temple. These included lighting the lamps, preparing the bread of the Presence (Leviticus 24:2-3), and offering incense (Exodus 30:7-8). They also performed additional tasks on Sabbaths and special occasions such as Passover and the Feast of Weeks (Leviticus 23).

3. Rites for leprosy and other impurities: The priests served as spiritual leaders, providing guidance on ritual purity and cleanliness. They were responsible for examining people with various forms of skin diseases, including leprosy, and determining their state of purity or impurity (Leviticus 13-14).

4. Judgment: Priests served as judges in matters concerning Israel's laws and ordinances (Exodus 18:22). They also played a role in resolving disputes between people (Deuteronomy 21:5).

5. Teaching and instruction: Priests were responsible for teaching the people God's laws, statutes, and judgments (Leviticus 10:11; Deuteronomy 33:10). They passed on sacred traditions to future generations (Numbers 15:40).

Overall, the ministry of Old Testament priests was an essential part of maintaining a right relationship between God and His people. Their roles encompassed both spiritual and practical aspects, providing guidance, offering sacrifices, and ensuring that God's people lived in accordance with His will.
