  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the ministry of the priests in the Old Testament, covering various aspects of their duties and responsibilities. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on the core aspects mentioned in the reference answer: offering sacrifices, taking care of the temple, and praying on behalf of the people. While the additional information provided by the student is valuable, it somewhat detracts from the central focus of the question and the reference answer. Incorporating more emphasis on the key points highlighted in the reference answer would have strengthened the response."
