  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the various aspects of the ministry of Old Testament priests, outlining their duties, responsibilities, and significance in maintaining the relationship between God and His people. It effectively expands on the answer provided and demonstrates a deep understanding of the Old Testament practices related to sacrificial service. The integration of biblical references enhances the clarity and support of the explanation. However, it could be further improved by explicitly connecting the Old Testament practices to modern ministry approaches, showing a more direct application of these principles in current Christian service."
