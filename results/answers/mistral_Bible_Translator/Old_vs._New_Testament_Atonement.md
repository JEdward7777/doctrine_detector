## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, the concept of atonement primarily revolves around the idea of reconciliation between God and His people by making a sacrifice or offering. This is often portrayed through rituals and ceremonies performed by the priests in the Tabernacle or Temple. The blood of the sacrifice was considered to have power to cover sins, symbolizing the willingness of the individual to turn away from their sinfulness and the forgiveness offered by God.

In contrast, the New Testament presents atonement primarily through Jesus Christ's sacrificial death on the cross. Here, the focus is not just on covering or forgiving sins but on the substitutionary atonement, where Jesus takes upon Himself the penalty of sin that humanity deserves. This understanding emphasizes the completed work of salvation by Jesus, securing reconciliation between God and man through faith in Christ.

While both Old and New Testaments share the common theme of atonement as a means of restoring relationship with God, the New Testament provides a more profound and ultimate fulfillment of that concept through Jesus' death and resurrection.
