  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has a good understanding of the difference between atonement in the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the shift from temporary to permanent atonement. They effectively explain how sacrifices in the Old Testament were temporary and symbolized reconciliation, while in the New Testament, Jesus' sacrifice provides permanent atonement for all sins. However, the student could have further emphasized the significance of Christ's sacrifice as the ultimate atonement that fulfills and surpasses the temporary rituals of the Old Testament."
