  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and insightful response that effectively compares and contrasts the concepts of atonement in the Old and New Testaments. It clearly explains the temporary nature of blood sacrifices in the Old Testament and emphasizes the ultimate and permanent atonement achieved through Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of biblical theology and communicates it intelligently."
