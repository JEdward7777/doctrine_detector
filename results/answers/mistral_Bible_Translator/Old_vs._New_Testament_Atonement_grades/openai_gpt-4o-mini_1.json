  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the transition from temporary atonement in the Old Testament to permanent atonement through Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament. It accurately contrasts the temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament with the permanent and sufficient sacrifice of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The response effectively addresses the concern raised about clarifying this transition within biblical history from a Christian worldview."
