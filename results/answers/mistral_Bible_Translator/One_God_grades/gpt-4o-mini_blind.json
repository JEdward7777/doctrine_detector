The strategies suggested are grounded in biblical principles and show a good understanding of the importance of accurately conveying the monotheistic nature of the God of Abraham. The use of cultural terms, emphasis on the unity and uniqueness of God, and the suggestions for comparisons, metaphors, and testimonies are all valuable approaches. One area for improvement could be to further emphasize the absolute sovereignty and holiness of God in contrast to the other deities, emphasizing His exclusive claim to worship."
