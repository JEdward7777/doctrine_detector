  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thoughtful response on how to emphasize the concept of 'One God' when translating the Bible for cultures that respect multiple deities. They suggested various strategies such as using appropriate cultural terms, explaining monotheism, and incorporating testimonies. However, the response could be improved by placing a stronger emphasis on the uniqueness of God's nature and the concept of the Trinity, as the teacher's reference answer highlights. Focusing more on ensuring no compromise on biblical monotheism would enhance the student's overall response."
