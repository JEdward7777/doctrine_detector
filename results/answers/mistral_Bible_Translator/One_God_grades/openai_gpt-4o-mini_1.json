It provides comprehensive strategies for addressing cultural polytheism while upholding the central tenet of monotheism. The use of appropriate cultural terms, emphasis on unity and uniqueness of God, explaining monotheism, using comparisons, metaphors, and testimonies, as well as collaborating with local leaders, all contribute to a well-rounded approach that is respectful and relevant to the cultural context."
