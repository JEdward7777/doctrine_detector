The strategies provided in the original response align well with this focus, especially in terms of using appropriate cultural terms, emphasizing unity and uniqueness of God, and explaining the concept of monotheism. The suggestions for comparisons, metaphors, and incorporating testimonies are particularly helpful in addressing cultural polytheism while affirming the biblical truth. Collaborating with local leaders is also essential in navigating cultural sensitivities. Overall, this response provides a comprehensive approach to upholding biblical monotheism in the context of cultural polytheism."
