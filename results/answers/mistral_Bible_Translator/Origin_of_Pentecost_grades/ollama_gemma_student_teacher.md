 Before the events described in the New Testament, the Festival of Weeks (also known as Pentecost) held significant historical and religious importance within Jewish tradition. It was one of three annual pilgrimage festivals that observant Jews were commanded to attend at the Temple in Jerusalem (Deuteronomy 16:16).

The festival was celebrated seven weeks, or forty-nine days, after the Festival of Unleavened Bread (also known as Passover), marking the completion of the barley harvest and the beginning of the wheat harvest. It was also a time to remember the giving of the Ten Commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai by God (Exodus 19:1-20, Exodus 34:28).

In the Hebrew calendar, it fell on the 50th day, which is why it was also called "Pentecost" in Greek â€“ pentekoste means "fiftieth." It was a joyful occasion and included offerings of new grain (Leviticus 23:16-22), feasting, and prayer. The Festival of Weeks was a significant event in Jewish life and played an important role in the continuity of tradition from generation to generation.

However, the festival gained additional religious significance after the events described in the New Testament when it became associated with the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples (Acts 2:1-4). This event is now widely celebrated by Christians as Pentecost Sunday or Whitsunday.
