It effectively shows how this Jewish celebration took on additional religious significance in Christianity. However, a stronger emphasis could have been placed on how Pentecost represents the birth of the Church and the empowerment of believers through the Holy Spirit in light of Christ's fulfillment of the Law and the prophets."
