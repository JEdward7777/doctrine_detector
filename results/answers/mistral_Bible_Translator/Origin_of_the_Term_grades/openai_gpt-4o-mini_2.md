 The term "Christian" was first used in Antioch, which is located in modern-day Turkey. This event is recorded in Acts 11:26 of the New Testament. According to Scripture, it was during the time when Barnabas and Saul (who later became Paul) were ministering there, and the disciples of Jesus Christ were called Christians because they followed the teachings of Christ.
