## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Hebrews, as referred to in the Bible, were the descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac and grandson Jacob (also called Israel). According to Genesis 12:1-3, God made a covenant with Abraham, promising to make him the father of a great nation. Through Abraham's son Ishmael and son Isaac, the nation's lineage can be traced to the 12 sons of Jacob (also called Israel), who became the ancestors of the 12 tribes of ancient Israel. Therefore, in the Bible, the Hebrews are closely connected with the people of Israel, who were chosen by God to receive His law and become a holy nation (Exodus 19:5-6).
