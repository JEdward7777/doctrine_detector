The incorporation of relevant Bible verses and the connection to the 12 tribes of Israel enhances the understanding of the Hebrew people's heritage within Biblical narratives. The response aligns well with the teacher's reference answer while also demonstrating a strong grasp of the Biblical context. Great job overall!"
