It appropriately connects the Old Testament Passover with the New Testament understanding of Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb. The explanation is doctrinally sound and effectively communicates the spiritual parallels between the Passover in Exodus and the redemption brought by Jesus. Great job overall!"
