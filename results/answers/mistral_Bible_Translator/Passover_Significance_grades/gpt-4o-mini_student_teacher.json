  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful answer connecting the Old Testament Passover with the New Testament revelation of Jesus. They effectively highlighted the symbolism of Jesus as the Passover Lamb and explained how His sacrifice relates to the Christian understanding of redemption and salvation. The biblical references and explanations were well-supported and demonstrated a strong grasp of the topic. The only improvement could have been a more concise presentation of the main point, aligning closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher."
