## [Answer](../Passover_Significance.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 For Christians, the celebration of Passover holds significant symbolism in relation to Jesus Christ, as it marks the event leading up to His crucifixion and resurrection. According to the New Testament in the Bible, Jesus was observed celebrating Passover with His disciples during the Last Supper (Matthew 26:17-30, Mark 14:12-26, Luke 22:7-20, and John 13:1-38). During this meal, Jesus instituted the sacrament of Holy Communion, using bread and wine to represent His body and blood, which would be sacrificed for the sins of humanity.

The Passover also symbolizes Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). According to the Old Testament (Exodus 12), the first Passover was celebrated by the Israelites when they were liberated from Egyptian slavery. A lamb without blemish was sacrificed, and its blood marked the doorposts of their homes as a sign for God to pass over them during the tenth plague that killed the firstborn sons of Egypt. In a similar way, Jesus is seen as the sacrificial Lamb whose shedding of blood pays for the sins of mankind.

Furthermore, the Passover celebrates the deliverance and redemption of God's chosen people, which is mirrored in Christian belief through faith in Jesus Christ and His redemptive work on the cross. Therefore, for Christians, celebrating Passover serves as a reminder of God's love, grace, and salvation through Christ.
