The student effectively highlights key insights such as the expectation of resistance when sharing the Gospel, the importance of perseverance and resilience, God's protection and provision, the power of prayer, the willingness to take risks in ministry, and the call to focus on Jesus. The response is well-supported with references to relevant scripture passages and offers practical applications for Christians today. Great job overall."
