## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Scripture, faith in Jesus' sacrifice plays a central role in achieving peace with God. This concept is most clearly articulated in the New Testament, particularly in the Epistles of Paul. Here are a few key passages that illustrate this:

1. Romans 3:24-25 - "And all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith."

2. Romans 5:1-2 - "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God."

3. Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."

In these passages, we see that faith in Jesus' sacrifice is not something humans earn or achieve, but rather it is a free gift from God. Through this faith, we are justified (declared righteous) and receive peace with God. This peace is not merely the absence of conflict, but a reconciled relationship with God, made possible by Christ's atoning sacrifice on the cross.

However, it's important to note that faith in Jesus' sacrifice does not excuse us from doing good works. Rather, our good works are evidence of our faith and gratitude for this free gift of salvation.

This is a brief summary and interpretation of these Scriptures. For a deeper understanding, it is recommended to read the passages in their full context and consider other related passages.
