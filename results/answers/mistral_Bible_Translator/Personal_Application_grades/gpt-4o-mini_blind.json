  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a strong understanding of purification from sin in Christianity by outlining the key aspects of justification, sanctification, metanoia, and purgation. They supported their points with relevant biblical references and explained the process clearly. The only room for improvement would be to further elaborate on the connection between purification and the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in the believer's life."
