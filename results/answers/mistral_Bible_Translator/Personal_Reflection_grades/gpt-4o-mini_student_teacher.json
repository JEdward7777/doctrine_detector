  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the expression \"woe is me\" in both Biblical and modern contexts, touching on the themes of personal suffering, guilt, recognition of sin, and seeking divine intervention. They effectively link the expression to personal awareness of sin and spiritual reflection, aligning with the concern of encouraging personal reflection on one's own spiritual state. While the student's answer goes beyond the reference answer in depth and insight, it could benefit from a more explicit emphasis on the connection to individual spiritual awareness and the need for repentance. Overall, a strong response that captures the essence of the concern with a Christian worldview perspective."
