## [Answer](../Personal_Reflection.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The expression "Woe is me" (or "Alas for me!") in a Biblical context, particularly when uttered by prophets such as Jeremiah or Isaiah, indicates deep sorrow, distress, and awareness of personal anguish or the sins of others. It's often used to express profound empathy and compassion for the people they are addressing, but it also reveals their recognition of the consequences of disobedience to God, both for themselves and those around them.

However, when an individual in modern context uses this phrase, it may imply a sense of personal suffering or guilt, acknowledging their own shortcomings and asking for divine intervention or understanding. In both cases, it shows a heightened awareness of personal condition (sinful or afflicted) and a longing for God's mercy and forgiveness.
