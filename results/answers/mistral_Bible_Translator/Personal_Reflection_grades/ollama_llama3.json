  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate understanding of what \"Woe is me\" means in both biblical and modern contexts, highlighting its connection to personal suffering, guilt, and a longing for God's mercy. The mention of prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah is also relevant to the concern about encouraging personal reflection on one's own spiritual state and awareness of sin.\n\nThe response successfully explores the phrase's implications for both the speaker (e.g., prophet) and the individual using it in modern times. While there isn't a direct quote from the Bible, the discussion demonstrates a good understanding of biblical themes and concepts. To achieve a higher grade, the response could provide more specific examples or illustrations from Scripture to support its claims.\n\nOverall, this is a well-written and thoughtful response that effectively addresses the concern about encouraging personal reflection on one's own spiritual state and awareness of sin."
