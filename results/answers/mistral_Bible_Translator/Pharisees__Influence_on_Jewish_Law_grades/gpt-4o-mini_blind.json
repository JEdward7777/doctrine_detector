The explanation of the Pharisees' emphasis on legalism versus Jesus' emphasis on spirituality is well articulated. However, the answer could be strengthened by including more specific examples of encounters between Jesus and the Pharisees from the Gospels. Additionally, tying in more scriptural references would have enhanced the depth of the analysis. Overall, a good response with room for further development."
