The inclusion of specific examples, such as the criticism Jesus directed towards the Pharisees in Matthew 23:23, effectively supports the argument. Additionally, the response effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how understanding the Pharisees' role sheds light on the challenges faced by Jesus in his ministry."
