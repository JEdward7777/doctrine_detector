It effectively addresses the concern by explaining how the Pharisees' focus on the letter of the law clashed with Jesus' emphasis on the spirit of the law, leading to conflicts and tensions. The response offers relevant scriptural references, logical reasoning, and a cohesive explanation, demonstrating a strong understanding of the Pharisees' role in the challenges faced by Jesus in his ministry. Great job!"
