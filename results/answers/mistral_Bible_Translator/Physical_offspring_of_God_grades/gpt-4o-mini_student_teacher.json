  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response to clarify the term \"Son of God\" for someone who believes it implies physical offspring of God. They included historical, cultural, Old Testament, and New Testament references, as well as analogies and relevant verses to support their explanation. However, the student's answer could be improved by focusing more on directly teaching that \"Son of God\" refers to Jesus' divine nature and relationship with God, rather than emphasizing historical context and analogies. It is important to directly address the concern at hand to prevent doctrinal errors effectively."
