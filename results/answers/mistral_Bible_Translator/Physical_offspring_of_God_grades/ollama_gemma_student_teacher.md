 To clarify the term "Son of God" for someone who believes it implies physical offspring of God, here are some steps that could be taken:

1. Explain the historical and cultural context: In ancient times, the title "Son of God" was used metaphorically to denote a special relationship between a ruler or hero and their deity. It did not necessarily imply physical descent from a god.

2. Discuss Old Testament references: Highlight instances where figures like Abraham (Genesis 22:18) and King David (2 Samuel 7:14) are called "son of God." In these cases, it is clear that they were not physical offspring but rather individuals who had a special relationship with God.

3. Present New Testament evidence: Explain that the Gospels do not describe Jesus as being physically born from God, but rather show his unique relationship with God through his miracles, teachings, and ultimate sacrifice.

4. Use analogies: Compare the concept of "Son of God" to human relationships like a son or daughter having a close, loving relationship with their father. Emphasize that it is not about biological lineage but rather about spiritual connection and identity.

5. Quote relevant verses: Share passages like John 1:1-3, which state that the Word (Jesus) was with God in the beginning and was God, emphasizing his divine nature. Also mention John 3:16, where Jesus is called "God's Son," reinforcing the idea of a special relationship rather than physical descent.

6. Discuss the Trinity: Explain that the Christian belief in the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) further clarifies the nature of the Son of God. Jesus is fully divine (God the Son) but also fully human, making Him unique in His relationship with the Father.

7. Encourage further study: Encourage the individual to study the Scriptures more deeply, pray for understanding, and discuss any questions or concerns they may have with fellow believers or a spiritual mentor.
