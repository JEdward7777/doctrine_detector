It effectively educates on the concept of \"Son of God\" in a way that aligns with Christian doctrine and emphasizes the importance of accurate biblical terminology. The suggested steps are clear, relevant, and promote a deeper understanding of the topic. The only slight room for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of accurate biblical terminology from the beginning of the explanation."
