The suggested steps effectively clarify the concept for someone who may misunderstand it as implying physical procreation, pointing out the divine nature and relationship with God that 'Son of God' embodies. Including historical, scriptural, and analogical support enhances the clarity and depth of understanding. Encouraging further study and dialogue for ongoing learning is also commendable."
