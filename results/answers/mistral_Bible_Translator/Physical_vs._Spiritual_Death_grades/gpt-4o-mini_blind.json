  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and insightful differentiation between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' from a Christian perspective. It accurately references relevant Bible verses and appropriately distinguishes between the two concepts. The explanation is solid and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, to improve the grade, the response could further elaborate on the redemptive aspect of Christ's sacrifice in relation to the spiritual meaning of 'perish' and provide more specific examples of how individuals can address and correct their spiritual state to avoid perishing."
