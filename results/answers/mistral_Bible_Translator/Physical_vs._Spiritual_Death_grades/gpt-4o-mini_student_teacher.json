  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer that effectively distinguishes between physical death and the spiritual meaning of 'perish' from a Christian worldview. They correctly highlighted the significance of these concepts in the biblical context and offered relevant scriptural references. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly link the concept of perishing to the eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus, as emphasized in the reference answer from the teacher."
