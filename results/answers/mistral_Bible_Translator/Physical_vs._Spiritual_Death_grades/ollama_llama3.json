  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinction between physical death and spiritual perishing, and provides relevant biblical examples to support its points. It also highlights the importance of maintaining this distinction in Bible translation.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response does not explicitly address the concern about clarifying the distinction between physical and spiritual death for proper understanding. While it is implied that the distinction is important, the response could be more explicit in emphasizing this point.\n\nComment: Overall, this is a strong response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts related to physical and spiritual death. With some further development to explicitly address the concern about clarifying the distinction between these two types of death, it could be even stronger."
