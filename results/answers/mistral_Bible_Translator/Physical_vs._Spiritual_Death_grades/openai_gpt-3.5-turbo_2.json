It effectively emphasizes the eternal consequences for those who do not trust in Jesus and highlights the importance of accurately conveying this distinction in translation work. The explanation is thorough, supported by relevant biblical references, and aligns well with Christian beliefs on the topic. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
