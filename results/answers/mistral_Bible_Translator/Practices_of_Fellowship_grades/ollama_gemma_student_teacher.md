## [Answer](../Practices_of_Fellowship.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Early Christians expressed their fellowship through various means, primarily centered around worship, communion, and acts of charity. Here's a brief overview:

1. Worship: The early Christians gathered for weekly Sunday services (Acts 20:7) to listen to teachings from the apostles, pray together, and break bread in remembrance of Christ (Acts 2:42). This communal worship was essential to their fellowship as it reinforced their shared beliefs and strengthened their bond with one another.

2. Communion: Also known as the Eucharist or Lord's Supper, the act of partaking in communion served as a powerful symbol of unity among believers (1 Corinthians 10:16-17). It was seen as a memorial to Christ's death and a means by which God strengthened the faith of his people.

3. Acts of Charity: Early Christians showed their fellowship not only in religious activities but also through acts of kindness and compassion towards one another (Galatians 6:10). They shared what they had, caring for the needy, widows, orphans, and travelers among them (Acts 2:44-45, James 1:27).

4. Prayer: Communal prayer was another important aspect of their fellowship. The early Christians prayed not only during their gatherings but also as individuals, supporting one another in times of need and lifting up prayers for each other (James 5:16, Ephesians 6:18).

5. Sharing Life Together: Early Christians spent a significant amount of time with one another, eating meals together, learning from one another, and encouraging one another in their faith (Acts 2:46, Hebrews 3:13). This close-knit community helped them to grow spiritually and supported them as they faced persecution and other challenges.

In summary, early Christians expressed their fellowship through shared worship, communion, acts of charity, prayer, and sharing life together. These practices reflected their deep commitment to one another in the faith and fostered a strong sense of unity among believers.

**Comments:**

The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of how early Christians expressed their fellowship. The response provides relevant examples from scripture to support each point. 

However, the grade could be slightly improved by:

* **Greater emphasis on listening to the teaching of God's Word:** The reference answer emphasizes this aspect, and the student's answer could benefit from including more explicit mention of how early Christians engaged in attentive listening to the apostles' teachings.
* **Expansion on sharing belongings:** The student's explanation of sharing belongings is concise. Adding more details about how early Christians distributed their possessions and the impact of this practice on their fellowship would strengthen the response.

Overall, this is a well-written and informative answer that demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic.
