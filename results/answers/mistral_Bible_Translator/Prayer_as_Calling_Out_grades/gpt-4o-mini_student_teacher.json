  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90. The student effectively captures the essence of 'calling out to the Lord' in prayers within a Christian context, emphasizing the aspects of faith, communication, dependence, and trust in God. They reference biblical scriptures to support their explanation and tie in the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life. Additionally, the student's answer reflects a deep understanding of the Christian worldview on prayer. Great job!"
