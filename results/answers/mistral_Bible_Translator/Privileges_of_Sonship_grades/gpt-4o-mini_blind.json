The student correctly identifies the two main privileges - the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and the inheritance as joint-heirs with Christ. The response also connects these privileges to the broader context of Romans 8, showing a good understanding of the passage. The mention of how these privileges are obtained through faith in Christ aligns well with Christian doctrine. Good job overall."
