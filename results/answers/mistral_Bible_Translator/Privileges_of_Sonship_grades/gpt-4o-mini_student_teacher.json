However, the student's answer focused more on the tangible benefits of being adopted children of God, such as the Holy Spirit dwelling in them and inheritance as co-heirs with Christ, rather than emphasizing the depth of the relationship between believers and God as the reference answer does. The student could improve by placing more emphasis on the personal and intimate aspect of the relationship with God that comes with adoption, as indicated by the use of 'Abba, Father'."
