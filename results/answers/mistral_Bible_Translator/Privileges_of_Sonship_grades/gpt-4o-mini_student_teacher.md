Recognizing the depth of the relationship between believers and God.

## [Answer](../Privileges_of_Sonship.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Romans 8:14-15, adopted children of God receive two main privileges:

1. The Spirit of God dwells in them: All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, Father."

2. Inheritance as joint-heirs with Christ: The entire chapter 8 of Romans emphasizes the incredible blessings that come to believers in Jesus Christ, including the promise of inheritance as co-heirs with Christ. Verse 17 states, "Now if we are children, then we are heirsâ€”heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ."

In summary, adopted children of God receive the Holy Spirit's presence and guidance in their lives, and they have an inheritance as co-heirs with Jesus Christ. This is not earned through human effort or good works but through faith in Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:26).

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the privileges adopted children of God receive as mentioned in Romans 8:14-15. However, the student's answer focused more on the tangible benefits of being adopted children of God, such as the Holy Spirit dwelling in them and inheritance as co-heirs with Christ, rather than emphasizing the depth of the relationship between believers and God as the reference answer does. The student could improve by placing more emphasis on the personal and intimate aspect of the relationship with God that comes with adoption, as indicated by the use of 'Abba, Father'.
