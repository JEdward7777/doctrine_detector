## [Answer](../Privileges_of_Sonship.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Romans 8:14-15, adopted children of God receive two main privileges:

1. The Spirit of God dwells in them: All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, Father."

2. Inheritance as joint-heirs with Christ: The entire chapter 8 of Romans emphasizes the incredible blessings that come to believers in Jesus Christ, including the promise of inheritance as co-heirs with Christ. Verse 17 states, "Now if we are children, then we are heirsâ€”heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ."

In summary, adopted children of God receive the Holy Spirit's presence and guidance in their lives, and they have an inheritance as co-heirs with Jesus Christ. This is not earned through human effort or good works but through faith in Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:26).

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the privileges adopted children of God receive based on Romans 8:14-15, emphasizing the presence of the Holy Spirit and the inheritance as joint-heirs with Christ. The addition of supporting verses from Galatians further strengthens the explanation. However, the response could have further elaborated on the personal and intimate nature of the relationship between believers and God to address the concern more directly.
