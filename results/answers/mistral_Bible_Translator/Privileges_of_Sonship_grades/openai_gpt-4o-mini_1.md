## [Answer](../Privileges_of_Sonship.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Romans 8:14-15, adopted children of God receive two main privileges:

1. The Spirit of God dwells in them: All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, Father."

2. Inheritance as joint-heirs with Christ: The entire chapter 8 of Romans emphasizes the incredible blessings that come to believers in Jesus Christ, including the promise of inheritance as co-heirs with Christ. Verse 17 states, "Now if we are children, then we are heirsâ€”heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ."

In summary, adopted children of God receive the Holy Spirit's presence and guidance in their lives, and they have an inheritance as co-heirs with Jesus Christ. This is not earned through human effort or good works but through faith in Jesus Christ (Galatians 3:26).
