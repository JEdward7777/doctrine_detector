  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer explaining the usage of \"Daughter of Zion\" in Biblical prophecies, illustrating the metaphorical significance within both the Old and New Testaments. The student effectively highlighted the deep affection and covenantal relationship between God and His chosen people. However, the answer could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the prophetic nature of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" to the recognition of historical contexts, to better apply the scriptures today."
