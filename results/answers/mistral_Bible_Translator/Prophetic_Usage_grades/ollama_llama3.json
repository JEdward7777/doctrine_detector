  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of recognizing the prophetic nature of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" and its historical context. The writer provides specific biblical examples from both the Old and New Testaments to illustrate how the phrase is used to convey messages of hope or warning. Additionally, the response correctly identifies the connection between the term and God's covenantal relationship with Israel.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are minor. For instance, the response could have delved deeper into the significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" as a metaphor for God's people, particularly in light of its prophetic nature. Additionally, while the writer does an excellent job of highlighting the biblical examples, they could have provided more context and analysis to help readers better understand the relevance of these passages to their own lives today.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" and its significance in the Bible."
