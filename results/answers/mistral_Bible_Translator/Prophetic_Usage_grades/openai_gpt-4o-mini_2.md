## [Answer](../Prophetic_Usage.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the term "Daughter of Zion" is often used as a metaphor for Jerusalem or God's chosen people, particularly the Israelites. This phrase is found throughout both the Old and New Testaments.

In the Old Testament, it is frequently used to describe Jerusalem in prophetic contexts. For example, in Lamentations 2:13, Jeremiah uses this term to express his grief over the destruction of Jerusalem. In Isaiah 62:6-7, God speaks lovingly to His people, saying "I have posted watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD, give yourselves no rest, and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes it a praise in the earth."

In the New Testament, Jesus uses this phrase in Matthew 23:37 when He laments over Jerusalem, saying "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!"

In these passages, we see God's deep affection for His people and His desire for their protection, restoration, and salvation. The term "Daughter of Zion" serves as a powerful reminder of God's covenantal relationship with Israel and the hope for restoration that is found in Jesus Christ.
