  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and well-rounded approach to discerning one's calling or purpose based on biblical principles. It emphasizes the importance of prayer, Scripture study, seeking wisdom from God, obedience to the Holy Spirit, seeking counsel from wise Christian friends, looking for confirmations, and patience. The student could improve the answer by incorporating more specific Bible verses or examples to support each point. Additionally, tying in the concept of surrendering one's will to God's sovereign plan would further strengthen the response. Overall, a solid and scripturally sound answer."
