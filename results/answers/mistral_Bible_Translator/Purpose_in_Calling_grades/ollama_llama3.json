  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nThis response scores high marks for its biblical accuracy, relevance to the concern, and provision of practical guidance. The author's emphasis on prayer, Scripture study, seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit, understanding one's gifts and passions, and being patient and persistent are all excellent strategies for discerning God's calling.\n\nThe only area where the response falls short is in its lack of explicit connection to specific biblical principles or passages. While the author does mention a few key verses, they could have been more thoroughly woven throughout the response to provide additional depth and authority.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that provides a clear and compelling vision for discerning God's calling and fulfilling His purpose in life."
