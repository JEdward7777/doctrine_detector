  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive understanding of the purpose of exhortation in the New Testament, highlighting the aspects of encouragement, instruction, and spiritual growth. The answer effectively addresses the concern of encouraging others in their faith journey by emphasizing how exhortations guide believers in applying biblical principles to daily life and promoting obedience to God's commands. While the student's answer aligns well with a Christian worldview, it does not directly mention persuading others to avoid sin, which is the specific focus of the biblical basis for exhortation provided in the reference answer. Therefore, the grade is slightly lower as the student could have further emphasized the aspect of persuading others to follow God's will."
