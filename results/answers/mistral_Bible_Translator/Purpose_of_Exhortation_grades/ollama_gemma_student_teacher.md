## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage, instruct, and challenge believers in their faith. Exhortations often aim to help Christians grow spiritually, live a life worthy of the Gospel, and demonstrate love for God and others. They provide guidance on how to apply biblical principles to daily life, foster holiness, promote unity, and inspire obedience to God's commands (1 Thessalonians 4:1-2, Hebrews 13:7, Colossians 3:16). Exhortations also serve as reminders of the blessings, rewards, and promises that await believers in Christ.

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately describes the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament as encouraging, instructing, and challenging believers in their faith. It also provides specific examples from the New Testament to support the claim. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the broader theological significance of exhortation in fostering spiritual growth and promoting unity among believers.
