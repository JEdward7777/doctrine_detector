## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Exhortation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament is to encourage, instruct, and challenge believers in their faith. Exhortations often aim to help Christians grow spiritually, live a life worthy of the Gospel, and demonstrate love for God and others. They provide guidance on how to apply biblical principles to daily life, foster holiness, promote unity, and inspire obedience to God's commands (1 Thessalonians 4:1-2, Hebrews 13:7, Colossians 3:16). Exhortations also serve as reminders of the blessings, rewards, and promises that await believers in Christ.
