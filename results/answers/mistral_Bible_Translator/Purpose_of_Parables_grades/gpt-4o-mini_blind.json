The explanation is clear and supported with scriptural reference. However, it could have delved deeper into how the parables also functioned as a way to separate those who were receptive to spiritual truths from those who were hardened in their hearts, as depicted in Matthew 13:10-17. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound answer."
