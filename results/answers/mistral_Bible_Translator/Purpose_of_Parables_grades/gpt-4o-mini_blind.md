## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Parables.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Christian faith, it's widely believed that Jesus used parables primarily as a teaching method to convey spiritual truths in a way that was relatable and easy for His listeners to understand. This method allowed Him to teach complex ideas about the Kingdom of God using everyday experiences and situations. The purpose of this storytelling approach was not just to inform but also to inspire and challenge people's hearts, often leading them to a deeper understanding of God and their relationship with Him. Jesus frequently emphasized that His parables were intended to be understood spiritually, rather than literally (see Matthew 13:10-17).

Comment: This response provides a solid understanding of the primary purpose of Jesus using parables in His teachings, emphasizing the conveyance of spiritual truths in a relatable manner. The explanation is clear and supported with scriptural reference. However, it could have delved deeper into how the parables also functioned as a way to separate those who were receptive to spiritual truths from those who were hardened in their hearts, as depicted in Matthew 13:10-17. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound answer.
