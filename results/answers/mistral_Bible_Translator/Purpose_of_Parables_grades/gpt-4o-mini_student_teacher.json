  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 75/100.\n\nWhile the student accurately highlighted the purpose of Jesus using parables as a teaching method to convey spiritual truths in a relatable manner, they did not explicitly mention the aspect of revealing truth to His disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe, which is a significant aspect of the purpose of parables according to a Christian worldview. The student should have emphasized more on the dual purpose of parables in revealing truth to believers while concealing it from unbelievers. This aspect is crucial in understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith."
