## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Parables.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Christian faith, it's widely believed that Jesus used parables primarily as a teaching method to convey spiritual truths in a way that was relatable and easy for His listeners to understand. This method allowed Him to teach complex ideas about the Kingdom of God using everyday experiences and situations. The purpose of this storytelling approach was not just to inform but also to inspire and challenge people's hearts, often leading them to a deeper understanding of God and their relationship with Him. Jesus frequently emphasized that His parables were intended to be understood spiritually, rather than literally (see Matthew 13:10-17).

75.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's response as 75/100.

While the student accurately highlighted the purpose of Jesus using parables as a teaching method to convey spiritual truths in a relatable manner, they did not explicitly mention the aspect of revealing truth to His disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe, which is a significant aspect of the purpose of parables according to a Christian worldview. The student should have emphasized more on the dual purpose of parables in revealing truth to believers while concealing it from unbelievers. This aspect is crucial in understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith.
