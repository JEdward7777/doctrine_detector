## [Answer](../Purpose_of_Parables.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Christian faith, it's widely believed that Jesus used parables primarily as a teaching method to convey spiritual truths in a way that was relatable and easy for His listeners to understand. This method allowed Him to teach complex ideas about the Kingdom of God using everyday experiences and situations. The purpose of this storytelling approach was not just to inform but also to inspire and challenge people's hearts, often leading them to a deeper understanding of God and their relationship with Him. Jesus frequently emphasized that His parables were intended to be understood spiritually, rather than literally (see Matthew 13:10-17).

**Grade:** 85

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings, referencing both their relatable nature and their spiritual significance. It also acknowledges the intention of Jesus to reveal truth to believers while concealing it from non-believers. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific spiritual insights or transformative experiences that parables often evoke in listeners.
