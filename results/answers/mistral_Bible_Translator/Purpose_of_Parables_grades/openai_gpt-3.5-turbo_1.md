# Question [Purpose of Parables](../../../questions/Purpose_of_Parables.md)
What is the primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings?

# Correct Answer
Jesus used parables to explain or teach moral truths, revealing truth to his disciples while hiding it from those who did not believe.

# Stated Concern
Understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith.

# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Christian faith, it's widely believed that Jesus used parables primarily as a teaching method to convey spiritual truths in a way that was relatable and easy for His listeners to understand. This method allowed Him to teach complex ideas about the Kingdom of God using everyday experiences and situations. The purpose of this storytelling approach was not just to inform but also to inspire and challenge people's hearts, often leading them to a deeper understanding of God and their relationship with Him. Jesus frequently emphasized that His parables were intended to be understood spiritually, rather than literally (see Matthew 13:10-17).
