It correctly highlights that Jesus used parables not only to convey moral truths but also to reveal spiritual truths to His disciples while simultaneously hiding them from those who did not believe. The response effectively addresses the concern about understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith within the Christian worldview."
