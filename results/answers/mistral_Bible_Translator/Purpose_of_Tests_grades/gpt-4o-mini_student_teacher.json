  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation rooted in Christian theology about the purpose of tests believers experience, focusing on spiritual growth and strengthening faith. However, the reference answer emphasizes that the primary purpose is to expose sin, lead believers to turn away from sin, and draw closer to God. The student's answer could have delved deeper into the aspect of addressing sin in the context of trials and tests, aligning more closely with the teacher's viewpoint."
