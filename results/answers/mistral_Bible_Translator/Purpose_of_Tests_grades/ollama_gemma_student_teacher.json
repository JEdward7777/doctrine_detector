  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on tests and trials. It effectively conveys that such experiences are not seen as random or punishment but as opportunities for spiritual growth. The student also intelligently highlights how trials help cultivate character and strengthen faith. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the specific role of tests in exposing sin and drawing believers closer to God, as suggested in the reference answer."
