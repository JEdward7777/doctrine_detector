  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-referenced answer that effectively explains the relationship between the soul and a person's relationship with God as described in scripture. They highlighted key biblical passages and concepts to support their points. However, the answer could be improved by directly addressing the concern provided and explicitly connecting how recognizing the soul's role can influence a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. Further integration of the reference answer into their response would have strengthened their argument."
