  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the term \"Rabbi\" in both Jewish and Christian contexts, correctly outlining its meaning and significance. They have also linked it well to the role of Jesus and the disciples. However, the student slightly missed addressing the specific concern of understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament in depth, making their response slightly off-centered."
