## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of Christian teaching, the term "Rabbi" originally comes from Hebrew and Aramaic and means "my teacher," "master," or "one who is great." In Judaism, a Rabbi is a spiritual leader, teacher, and interpreter of Jewish law.

In Christianity, the title "Rabbi" was used for Jesus during His lifetime (Matthew 26:25; John 1:49). In fact, it's translated as "Teacher" in most English Bibles. This reflects His role as a teacher and authority figure. The disciples were also referred to as Rabbis by others (Matthew 8:19; Mark 9:5) although they did not claim the title for themselves.

In modern times, "Rabbi" is a title used for ordained clergy in some Messianic Jewish congregations or churches that have Jewish roots. These Rabbis are usually spiritual leaders who provide teaching, guidance, and pastoral care within their communities.
