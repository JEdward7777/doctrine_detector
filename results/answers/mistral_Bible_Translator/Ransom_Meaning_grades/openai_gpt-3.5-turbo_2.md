## [Answer](../Ransom_Meaning.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, the term "ransom" (Latin: "reditus") used in connection with Jesus Christ refers to the idea that Jesus paid the price to deliver humanity from slavery to sin and death. This concept is derived primarily from passages such as Mark 10:45, where Jesus says, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

The idea behind this symbolism is that humanity was held in bondage by sin (a result of Adam's fall in the Garden of Eden), owing a debt to God that could not be paid by humans alone. Jesus, as the perfect and sinless Son of God, offered Himself as the ransom price for humanity, thereby satisfying God's justice and making it possible for sinners to be redeemed and receive eternal life.

This theology is known as "ransom theory" or "redemption theory," which emphasizes that Christ's death on the cross was a substitutionary sacrifice, where Jesus took the punishment due to humanity's sin upon Himself. This belief is one of the ways in which Christianity explains how salvation and reconciliation between God and humanity are made possible.
