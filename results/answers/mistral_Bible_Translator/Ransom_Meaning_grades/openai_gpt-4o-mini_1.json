It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how redemption leads to salvation and freedom from bondage to sin. The only minor improvement could be to expand on how this redemption leads to a restored relationship with God, emphasizing the relational aspect of salvation in addition to the transactional aspect of the ransom."
