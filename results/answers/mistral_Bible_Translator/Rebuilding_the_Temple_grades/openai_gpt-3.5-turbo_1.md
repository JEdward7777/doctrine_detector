# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The events leading to the destruction and rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem can be traced back to ancient Biblical history, specifically during the periods of the Kingdoms of Judah and Israel. Here's a simplified timeline:

1. First Temple (Solomon's Temple): King Solomon built the First Temple around 957 BC, which was one of the great achievements of his reign (1 Kings 6). This temple served as the central place of worship for the Israelites for nearly 400 years.

2. Destruction of the First Temple: The Babylonian army, led by Nebuchadnezzar II, invaded Judah in 587 BC and destroyed the First Temple (2 Chronicles 36:17-21). This was a consequence of disobedience to God's laws, as the Israelites had turned away from Him and practiced idolatry.

3. Exile: The surviving Jews were taken into exile in Babylon (2 Kings 25:21). This period of captivity lasted for approximately 70 years, prophesied by the prophet Jeremiah (Jeremiah 25:11-12).

4. Return from Exile and Reconstruction of the Second Temple: In 538 BC, King Cyrus of Persia issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Judah and rebuild their temple (Ezra 1:1-4). The Second Temple was completed in 515 BC under the governorship of Zerubbabel (Ezra 6:15).

The history of the temples provides a reminder of God's faithfulness and patience, as well as the consequences of disobedience and the importance of following His laws. The rebuilt Temple served as the central place of worship until its destruction by the Romans in AD 70, marking another significant event in Jewish and Christian history.
