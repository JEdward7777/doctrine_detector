# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the concept of redemption and the practice of redeeming people or property in ancient Israel are closely related but distinct concepts. Redemption in a biblical context is primarily spiritual and refers to the salvation or deliverance from sin and its consequences, ultimately achieved through Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

In contrast, the practice of redemption within ancient Israelite society was more tangible and legalistic. It involved restoring something (or someone) that had been lost or sold due to various circumstances. The term used in Hebrew is "ga'al" or "pidyon," which often referred to buying back a person, property, or even an animal. For instance, if a Hebrew slave went free but was later sold into slavery, his fellow Israelite could buy him back (Exodus 21:8). Similarly, if a firstborn son was redeemed by another family member (Numbers 3:47-49), it meant purchasing the right to raise the child instead of offering him to serve in the Tabernacle.

In both cases, redemption highlights the importance of restoration, release from bondage or debt, and the upholding of kinship bonds within Israelite society. However, spiritual redemption transcends these earthly notions by offering eternal salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. This concept permeates the New Testament and is expressed most clearly in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Romans 3:24-26; Ephesians 1:7). Thus, while there are similarities between biblical redemption and the practice of redeeming people or property in ancient Israel, the spiritual dimension of redemption as a means of salvation is unique to Christian theology.
