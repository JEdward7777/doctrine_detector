## [Answer](../Regular_Practice.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Apostle Paul established the Lord's Supper, also known as Communion or Eucharist, as a regular practice for believers primarily as a way to remember and celebrate Jesus Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection. This tradition was initiated by Jesus himself during the Last Supper with his disciples before his crucifixion (Matthew 26:26-29, Mark 14:22-25, Luke 22:17-20).

In 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, Paul explains the institution of the Lord's Supper: "For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, 'This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.' For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes."

The Lord's Supper serves to reinforce believers' unity with one another as the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 10:16-17) and strengthen their faith in Christ's sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. It is a sacred event that helps Christians remember and reaffirm their commitment to following Jesus Christ.
