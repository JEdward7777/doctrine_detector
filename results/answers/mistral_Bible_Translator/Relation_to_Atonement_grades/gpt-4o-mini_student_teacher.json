  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of both 'propitiation' and 'atonement,' highlighting their differences and similarities within Christian theology. They effectively conveyed the central concepts and significance of each term while emphasizing the importance of Christ's sacrifice in reconciliation. The response demonstrated a solid understanding of the theological implications of these terms. The student could slightly improve by more concisely capturing the essential point of propitiation, as laid out in the reference answer."
