## [Answer](../Relation_to_Atonement.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, both 'propitiation' and 'atonement' are terms that refer to the reconciliation between God and humanity made possible through Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross. They are closely related concepts, although they emphasize slightly different aspects of this reconciliation process.

'Atonement' is a broader term that encompasses various ways in which sin is forgiven and reconciliation with God is achieved. It can be understood as making amends for wrongs committed, restoring harmony between God and humanity, and removing the guilt and punishment due to sin.

'Propitiation', on the other hand, specifically refers to the act of appeasing or satisfying God's wrath against sin by means of a sacrifice or offering. In this context, propitiation emphasizes the turning away of God's anger through Christ's atoning work on the cross.

In essence, atonement encompasses the various ways in which reconciliation is achieved, while propitiation is one of those waysâ€”the satisfying of God's wrath against sin through Jesus' sacrifice. Both terms are essential to understanding the biblical doctrine of salvation and the role of Christ as our Savior and Redeemer.
