  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concepts of atonement and propitiation, correctly stating that they are closely related but emphasizing different aspects of the reconciliation process. The explanation of atonement as making amends for wrongs committed, restoring harmony between God and humanity, and removing guilt and punishment due to sin is also accurate.\n\nThe student's summary of propitiation as appeasing or satisfying God's wrath against sin through a sacrifice or offering is also correct. However, the response could have gone further in exploring the nuances between atonement and propitiation, such as providing more specific biblical examples or discussing how these concepts relate to other theological themes.\n\nOverall, the student has provided a clear and concise explanation of the terms, but could have delved deeper into the theological implications and connections between them."
