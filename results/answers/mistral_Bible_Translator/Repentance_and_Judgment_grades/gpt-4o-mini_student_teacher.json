  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer showcasing a good understanding of the relationship between repentance and God's wrath in the Bible. They correctly highlighted the significance of repentance as a turnaround in heart and actions towards God. The student's references to both the Old Testament and New Testament, along with citing specific verses, demonstrate a solid understanding of the topic. However, the student could have tied in the teacher's reference answer more directly to show a deeper connection between repentance and the wrath of God."
