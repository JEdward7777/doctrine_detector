The response clearly explains the need for genuine repentance as a response to God's forgiveness and emphasizes that it is not earned but is a result of God's mercy and grace. The inclusion of passages from Romans 2:4-5 and Ephesians 2:8-9 effectively reinforces the connection between repentance and God's forgiveness."
