## [Answer](../Repentance_and_Judgment.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, repentance plays a crucial role in addressing the issue of God's wrath. Repentance is not just feeling sorry for one's sins, but a complete turnaround in heart, attitude, and actions towards God.

The Old Testament provides many examples where individuals or nations experienced God's wrath due to their disobedience, but were given the opportunity to repent and return to Him (e.g., Jonah 3:10; Ezekiel 18:23).

In the New Testament, Jesus often called people to repentance, demonstrating its importance (Matthew 4:17, Mark 6:12). Similarly, the Apostles urged repentance in their preaching (Acts 2:38, 5:31, 17:30).

One of the most significant passages about this topic can be found in Romans 2:4-5, where Paul writes: "Do you not know, my dear friends, that all our fathers were under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea? They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. They ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ." Here, Paul emphasizes the idea of a turnaround (repentance) as a response to God's forgiveness.

However, it is essential to remember that repentance does not earn salvation but acknowledges our need for God's mercy and grace (Ephesians 2:8-9). The relationship between repentance and the wrath of God is one where God's wrath is appeased through Christ's atonement, making it possible for those who genuinely repent to experience His forgiveness and avoid eternal separation from Him.
