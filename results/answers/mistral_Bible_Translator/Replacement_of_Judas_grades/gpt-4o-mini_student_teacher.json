  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of how Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, showing an understanding of the biblical account in Acts 1:23-26. The student also correctly noted the timing of this event in relation to Jesus' ascension. However, the additional information about the Beloved Disciple could be seen as an unnecessary tangent for the specific concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension."
