## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Apostle Matthias was chosen by lot (casting of lots) to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, according to Acts 1:23-26. This event occurred after Jesus' ascension and before Pentecost in the early Christian church. However, it is important to note that only Matthias is recorded as being chosen this way, while the other disciple chosen by tradition, often referred to as "the Beloved Disciple" or John, was not among those who chose to be numbered with the twelve apostles.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of how Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, showing an understanding of the biblical account in Acts 1:23-26. The student also correctly noted the timing of this event in relation to Jesus' ascension. However, the additional information about the Beloved Disciple could be seen as an unnecessary tangent for the specific concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.
