  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response accurately describes the event of Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, which shows an understanding of the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The mention of Acts 1:23-26 also demonstrates a familiarity with the biblical account.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response does not explicitly highlight the significance of Matthias' selection in relation to the continuity of apostolic leadership. While it mentions that this event occurred \"after Jesus' ascension and before Pentecost\", it could be more explicit in emphasizing how Matthias' choice ensured the continuation of apostolic authority.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the historical context of Matthias' selection, but could benefit from further development to explicitly emphasize its relevance to the concern about recognizing continuity of apostolic leadership."
