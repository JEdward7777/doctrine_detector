## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Apostle Matthias was chosen by lot (casting of lots) to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, according to Acts 1:23-26. This event occurred after Jesus' ascension and before Pentecost in the early Christian church. However, it is important to note that only Matthias is recorded as being chosen this way, while the other disciple chosen by tradition, often referred to as "the Beloved Disciple" or John, was not among those who chose to be numbered with the twelve apostles.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response accurately describes the event of Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, which shows an understanding of the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. The mention of Acts 1:23-26 also demonstrates a familiarity with the biblical account.

However, I deduct points because the response does not explicitly highlight the significance of Matthias' selection in relation to the continuity of apostolic leadership. While it mentions that this event occurred "after Jesus' ascension and before Pentecost", it could be more explicit in emphasizing how Matthias' choice ensured the continuation of apostolic authority.

Overall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding the historical context of Matthias' selection, but could benefit from further development to explicitly emphasize its relevance to the concern about recognizing continuity of apostolic leadership.
