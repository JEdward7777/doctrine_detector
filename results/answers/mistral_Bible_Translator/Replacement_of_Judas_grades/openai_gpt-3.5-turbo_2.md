## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Apostle Matthias was chosen by lot (casting of lots) to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, according to Acts 1:23-26. This event occurred after Jesus' ascension and before Pentecost in the early Christian church. However, it is important to note that only Matthias is recorded as being chosen this way, while the other disciple chosen by tradition, often referred to as "the Beloved Disciple" or John, was not among those who chose to be numbered with the twelve apostles.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response accurately explains the replacement of Judas Iscariot by Matthias, but it could further emphasize the importance of maintaining the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. A Christian worldview would stress the significance of appointing a successor to ensure the continuation of Jesus' mission and teachings through the apostles.
