  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response accurately states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death, which aligns with the biblical account in Acts. However, the response does not directly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. To improve the grade, the answer could have highlighted the significance of Matthias' selection in maintaining the leadership structure established by Jesus among the twelve apostles, ensuring continuity in spreading the Gospel message."
