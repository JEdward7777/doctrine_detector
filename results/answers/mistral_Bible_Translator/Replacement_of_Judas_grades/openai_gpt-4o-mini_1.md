## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Apostle Matthias was chosen by lot (casting of lots) to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles, according to Acts 1:23-26. This event occurred after Jesus' ascension and before Pentecost in the early Christian church. However, it is important to note that only Matthias is recorded as being chosen this way, while the other disciple chosen by tradition, often referred to as "the Beloved Disciple" or John, was not among those who chose to be numbered with the twelve apostles.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response accurately states that Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after his betrayal and death, which aligns with the biblical account in Acts. However, the response does not directly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. To improve the grade, the answer could have highlighted the significance of Matthias' selection in maintaining the leadership structure established by Jesus among the twelve apostles, ensuring continuity in spreading the Gospel message.
