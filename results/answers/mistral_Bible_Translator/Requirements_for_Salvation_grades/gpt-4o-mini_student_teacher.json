  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer citing relevant Bible verses that emphasize the importance of faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. However, the reference answer from the teacher specifically mentions repentance as a requirement for salvation, which the student's answer does not explicitly address. If the student had included repentance as a key aspect of salvation in their response, their grade would have been higher."
