# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christianity, salvation is often understood as being reconciled with God through faith in Jesus Christ. The Bible provides several key passages that discuss this concept:

1. John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." This verse highlights the importance of belief in Jesus as a requirement for salvation.
2. Romans 3:23 - "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," and Romans 6:23 - "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." These verses emphasize that salvation is a free gift from God to those who acknowledge their sinfulness.
3. Acts 4:12 - "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved." This verse underscores the unique role of Jesus Christ as the only means through whom salvation can be obtained.
4. Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast." This passage reiterates that salvation comes as a free gift of grace through faith and not by any good deeds or works.
5. 1 John 5:12 - "Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life." This verse underscores the importance of having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ as a prerequisite for eternal life.

In summary, according to Christian theology, salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ as a free gift from God, which is extended to those who acknowledge their sinfulness and accept Him as their Savior. This belief can vary among different denominations, but these verses provide a foundational understanding of what the Bible teaches about salvation.
