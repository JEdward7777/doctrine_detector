They accurately referenced the relevant passages in Acts and highlighted Peter's approach of addressing the collective guilt of the Jewish people while offering them a path to forgiveness through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. However, there could have been more emphasis on the need for personal repentance and acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior for individual salvation, as well as referencing the importance of the resurrection in the message of salvation."
