  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of how Peter addressed the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion, citing relevant scripture verses and highlighting the message of repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. The answer aligns well with the Christian worldview by emphasizing the need for forgiveness and salvation through belief in Jesus. However, the reference answer from the teacher is slightly more concise and to the point in capturing the essence of Peter's message."
