The focus on the collective guilt of the crowd in crucifying Jesus and the emphasis on the need for repentance and faith in response to the gospel message is well articulated. The response effectively addresses the concern regarding evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel from a Christian worldview. Well done!"
