However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the broader understanding of resurrection as the act of becoming alive again after death through God's power, rather than solely emphasizing Jesus' resurrection. Emphasizing the general concept of resurrection in Christian theology, beyond Jesus' specific resurrection, would enhance the response."
