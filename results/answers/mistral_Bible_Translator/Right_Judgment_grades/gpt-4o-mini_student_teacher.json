  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer effectively captures the essence of Luke 6:37 and its implications for how Christians should approach judging others. The response appropriately emphasizes the importance of forgiveness, grace, and avoiding condemnation in line with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The connection to promoting a spirit of grace rather than judgment within Christian communities is well articulated. Overall, a strong understanding and application of the biblical principles discussed. Great job!"
