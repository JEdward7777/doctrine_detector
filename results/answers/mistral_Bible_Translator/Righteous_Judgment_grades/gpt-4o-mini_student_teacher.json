  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out answer to the question, addressing how Christians can reconcile God's wrath with His nature of love and mercy. They have considered various aspects such as the nature of God, redemption through Jesus Christ, free will, prayer, and repentance. While the student has explored the complexities of the topic and provided examples from scripture, they could have more explicitly tied their answer back to the reference answer provided by the teacher. Strengthening this connection would ensure a more effective alignment with the Christian worldview."
