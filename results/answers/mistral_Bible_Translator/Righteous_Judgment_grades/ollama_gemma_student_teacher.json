The response is well-organized, providing clear explanations and supporting arguments from Scripture. It addresses the concern of reconciling these seemingly contradictory attributes of God while upholding the biblical teaching that they are not mutually exclusive but rather interconnected aspects of God's character. The answer also acknowledges the complexity of understanding God's nature and encourages seeking wisdom from Scripture and prayer."
