  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response an 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive overview of the various roles of angels according to biblical references, they included additional details beyond the reference answer. The student did an excellent job elaborating on the roles of angels in worship, spiritual warfare, and ministering to believers, which demonstrates a deeper understanding of the topic. However, the student could have focused more on the specific roles mentioned in the reference answer, such as delivering messages, providing protection, strengthening God's people, and communicating on behalf of God. By closely aligning their response with the specific roles highlighted in the reference answer, the student could have scored higher. Overall, the student's answer shows a strong grasp of the topic with room for improvement in aligning with the given answer and concern."
