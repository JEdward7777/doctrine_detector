## [Answer](../Role_of_Angels_in_Human_Affairs.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to biblical references, angels serve God primarily in various roles that uphold and execute His will in the heavenly realm and on earth. Here are some of their key functions:

1. Worshipping God: Angels are often depicted as worshipping God continually, praising Him for who He is (Revelation 4:8-11). This demonstrates their loyalty to God and the nature of their eternal devotion.

2. Delivering messages from God: Angels function as messengers between God and humans (e.g., Gabriel to Zechariah, Mary, and Joseph in Luke 1) or between angels themselves (e.g., the angel of the Lord appearing to Hagar in Genesis 16). They are often used to deliver important announcements, encouragement, and warnings.

3. Protecting and guiding people: God assigns angels to protect and guide specific individuals or groups of people (e.g., Daniel 10:13-21; Psalm 91:11). This includes guardian angels that watch over believers (Matthew 18:10).

4. Warfare against evil forces: Angels are involved in spiritual warfare, battling against demonic spirits and other fallen angels to protect God's people and maintain His will on earth (e.g., Daniel 10:20-21; Ephesians 6:12).

5. Executing God's justice: Angels are sometimes involved in executing divine judgments, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19) or punishing those who rebel against God (e.g., 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10).

6. Ministering to believers: Angels may minister to believers, providing comfort, encouragement, or even physical healing (e.g., Acts 5:19; Hebrews 1:14).

7. Praising God's glory and works: Angels often celebrate God's power, majesty, and wonders, as seen in their response to the birth of Jesus (Luke 2:13-14) or the Lamb that was slain (Revelation 5:8-10).

These roles demonstrate angels' essential service to God in upholding His will, executing His justice, and glorifying Him both in heaven and on earth.
