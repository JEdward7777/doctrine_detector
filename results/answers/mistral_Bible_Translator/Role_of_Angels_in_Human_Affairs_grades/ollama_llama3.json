However, it could be improved by more explicitly addressing how understanding these roles can impact Christians' perceptions of divine intervention in their lives.\n\nThe response does touch on this concern when mentioning angels providing protection and guidance, but a deeper exploration of how understanding these roles can shape one's perspective on God's involvement in daily life would strengthen the argument. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of biblical references and provides a comprehensive view of angelic functions, which is commendable.\n\nTo reach a perfect score (100), the response could further develop its connection to the concern by incorporating more examples or anecdotes illustrating how understanding angels' roles can influence Christians' perceptions of divine intervention."
