 In the biblical account of the Passover, the significance of the blood is profound and multifaceted. It serves as a symbol of protection, covenant, remembrance, and redemption.

The Passover event is first mentioned in Exodus 12, where God instructed Moses to have each Israelite family select an unblemished lamb on the 10th day of the month. This lamb was to be sacrificed on the 14th day at twilight, and its blood was to be applied to the doorposts of their homes as a sign for the Lord to pass over them, sparing the firstborn sons from death that would strike the Egyptians (Exodus 12:13).

This act of applying the blood served as a sign of the covenant between God and his people. By obeying this command, the Israelites acknowledged God's power and protection over them, and in return, He promised to be their God and deliver them from bondage (Exodus 12:26-27).

The blood of the Passover lamb also symbolized redemption, as the Israelites were being redeemed from slavery in Egypt. The blood served as a ransom, buying back the lives of the firstborn sons (Numbers 3:45-46). This idea of redemption through the shedding of blood is echoed throughout the Old Testament and finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

Lastly, the Passover observance was established as a perpetual remembrance for the generations to come (Exodus 12:24). The annual celebration reminds Israelites of God's faithfulness in delivering them from Egypt and preserving them as His people. It serves as a reminder of their redemption, the covenant they share with God, and the importance of passing these truths on to future generations.

In summary, the blood of the Passover lamb signifies protection, covenant, redemption, and remembrance, highlighting key themes in biblical theology and foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.
