  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-reasoned response that acknowledges the roles of eunuchs in ancient times and their significance in serving in royal courts. The student effectively connects these roles to God's broader plan by highlighting how eunuchs were utilized by God in various contexts, such as temple service and the encounter of the Ethiopian eunuch in the New Testament. However, the response could be strengthened by explicitly mentioning how the roles of eunuchs reflect God's plan for different individuals in society, as outlined in the reference answer, which emphasizes God's ability to use anyone to fulfill His purposes irrespective of physical or social status."
