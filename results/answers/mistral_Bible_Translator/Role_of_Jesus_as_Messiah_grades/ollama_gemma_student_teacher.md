## [Answer](../Role_of_Jesus_as_Messiah.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christianity, the concept of the Kingdom of God is closely tied to Jesus' role as the Messiah (or Christ). The term "Kingdom of God" appears frequently in the New Testament, particularly in the teachings and parables of Jesus.

The Kingdom of God refers to the reign or rule of God in people's lives and in the world. It is both a present reality (as God's spiritual rule in the hearts of believers) and a future hope (a time when God will fully establish His kingdom on earth, often referred to as the eschaton or end times).

Jesus' role as the Messiah was expected to include establishing God's Kingdom on earth. The Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah often describe Him as a king who would restore Israel, deliver the people from oppression, and usher in an era of peace and prosperity (see Isaiah 9:6-7, Jeremiah 23:5-6).

In the New Testament, Jesus claimed to be the Messiah and demonstrated His kingship by performing miracles, teaching with authority, and demonstrating love and compassion. However, rather than establishing a political kingdom on earth as many expected, Jesus emphasized that His Kingdom was not of this world (John 18:36). Instead, He focused on building the Kingdom of God in people's hearts by proclaiming the Good News, calling for repentance, and offering forgiveness of sins.

In summary, the concept of the Kingdom of God is central to understanding Jesus' role as the Messiah. While Jesus did not establish a physical kingdom on earth as some expected, He came to bring about the spiritual Kingdom of God in people's lives through His teachings and ministry.
