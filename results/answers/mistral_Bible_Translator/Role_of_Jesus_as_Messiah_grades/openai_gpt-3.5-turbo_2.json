It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' fulfillment of prophecy and rulership over God's kingdom with righteousness. The connection between Jesus' role and God's plan for humanity is well-articulated. Some additional elaboration on the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection in relation to His role as the Messiah could further strengthen the response."
