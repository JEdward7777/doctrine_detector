  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of highlighting Jesus' divinity and role in revealing God, which aligns with the concern. It correctly emphasizes that Jesus is not just a human messenger but rather the full expression of God's message to humanity. The explanation also mentions Jesus' divine nature, eternality, and unity with the Father, which further supports His role as the Word of God.\n\nHowever, while the response does an excellent job of explaining Jesus' divinity and role in revelation, it could be more explicit about the significance of this title for understanding Jesus' relationship with humanity. For instance, the response could have delved deeper into how Jesus' divinity makes Him the perfect mediator between humanity and God.\n\nOverall, I would give this response a score of 85 because it effectively recognizes the significance of Jesus' divinity and role in revealing God, but could be more detailed in its explanation."
