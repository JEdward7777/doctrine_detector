  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided an in-depth and thorough understanding of the role of Jesus in our salvation, referencing multiple scriptures to support their points. However, the only concern is that the answer may be overly detailed which could potentially overwhelm those new to the Christian faith. Nonetheless, the student has demonstrated a strong grasp of the topic from a Christian perspective."
