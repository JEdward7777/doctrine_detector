## [Answer](../Role_of_Jesus.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible describes the role of Jesus in our salvation as follows:

1. Propitiation (Romans 3:25, 1 John 2:2, 4:10): Jesus' death on the cross is seen as a sacrifice that appeases God's wrath against sin and makes it possible for sinners to be reconciled to Him.

2. Redemption (Galatians 3:13, Ephesians 1:7): Jesus paid the price for our sins through His death, freeing us from the power of sin and giving us the opportunity for eternal life.

3. Reconciliation (Colossians 1:20-22, 2 Corinthians 5:18-21): Through Jesus, God reconciled us to Himself, making peace by the blood of His cross. This reconciliation allows us to have a relationship with God and to live in harmony with Him.

4. Salvation (John 3:16, Acts 4:12): Jesus is the only way to salvation. He is the Savior who came to save us from our sins and to give us eternal life.

5. Mediator (1 Timothy 2:5-6): Jesus is our mediator, acting as a go-between for us and God. Through His perfect life, death, and resurrection, He has made it possible for us to approach God with confidence.

6. Lord and Savior (Philippians 3:20, Acts 4:12): Jesus is both our Lord (master and ruler) and our Savior (the one who saves us from sin and death). As Lord, He has authority over our lives; as Savior, He has provided a way for us to be saved.

7. High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16): Jesus serves as our high priest, interceding for us before God and making it possible for us to receive forgiveness and grace.

8. Redeemer (Titus 2:13-14): Jesus is the redeemer who purchased our freedom from sin and death through His blood. He has rescued us from our old way of life and given us a new one.

9. Sacrifice (Hebrews 9:14, 10:10): Jesus, as the sacrificial lamb, took upon Himself the punishment for our sins on the cross, making it possible for us to be forgiven and made righteous before God.

10. Sovereign (Revelation 19:16): As the King of kings and Lord of lords, Jesus has ultimate authority over all things, including our salvation. He is in control of our journey toward Him and ultimately determines who will be saved.
