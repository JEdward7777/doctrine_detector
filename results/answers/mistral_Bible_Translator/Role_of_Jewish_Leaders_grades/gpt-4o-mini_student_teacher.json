  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation of the Jewish religious leaders' influence on the crucifixion of Jesus, drawing from biblical accounts and theological perspectives. However, the response could have more directly addressed the concern by emphasizing the dynamic between religious authority and civil power in the historical context of Jesus' death. Additionally, the student effectively acknowledges the limitations of the biblical narrative and demonstrates an understanding of the complexities and sensitivities surrounding this topic."
