  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the use of parables in biblical narratives. The student clearly explains how Nathan's parable effectively exposed David's moral failing without directly accusing him. The analysis is thorough and well-supported by textual evidence from 2 Samuel 12. The student also highlights the importance of using parables in a gentle and effective way to address moral shortcomings."
