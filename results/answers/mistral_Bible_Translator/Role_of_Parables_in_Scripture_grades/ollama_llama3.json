The writer also correctly identifies the purpose of the parable as leading David to acknowledge and repent of his sin.\n\nThe response meets the concern by demonstrating a thorough understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. The analysis is well-organized, and the writer provides specific examples from 2 Samuel 12:1-7 to support their argument.\n\nTo achieve a perfect score, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection between Nathan's use of the parable and broader biblical teachings on the importance of humility, repentance, and the role of prophets in correcting sin. Additionally, while the writer does an excellent job of explaining the story itself, they could delve deeper into the theological implications of the parable and its relevance to modern Christian life."
