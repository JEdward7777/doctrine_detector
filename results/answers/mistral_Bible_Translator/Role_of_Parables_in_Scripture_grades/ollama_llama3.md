 In 2 Samuel 12:1-7, Nathan the prophet utilized a parable as a subtle but effective means to confront King David about his sin with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah. The parable was intended to expose David's moral failing without directly accusing him.

In the story, Nathan tells David about two men: one rich and another poor. The rich man had many sheep and a little lamb, which he loved dearly. One day the rich man took this beloved lamb and prepared it for a meal. Meanwhile, the poor man had only one lamb – a pet – but it died. To the surprise of the rich man, when the poor man found out about his loss, the rich man did not give him his own cherished lamb to make up for it. Instead, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for a meal.

After Nathan finished telling this story, David was indignant at the rich man's injustice towards the poor man (2 Samuel 12:5-6). Nathan then revealed that this parable was about David himself and his sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12:7): "You are that man!" By using a parable, Nathan skillfully conveyed the gravity of David's sin without explicitly accusing him directly, making it easier for King David to acknowledge his guilt.

This parable serves as an example of a wise and gentle approach in addressing someone's moral shortcomings while preserving their dignity and promoting self-realization.

Grade: 92

The response provides a clear and detailed explanation of Nathan's use of a parable to confront King David about his sin, highlighting its effectiveness in exposing David's moral failing without directly accusing him. The writer also correctly identifies the purpose of the parable as leading David to acknowledge and repent of his sin.

The response meets the concern by demonstrating a thorough understanding of the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in biblical narratives. The analysis is well-organized, and the writer provides specific examples from 2 Samuel 12:1-7 to support their argument.

To achieve a perfect score, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection between Nathan's use of the parable and broader biblical teachings on the importance of humility, repentance, and the role of prophets in correcting sin. Additionally, while the writer does an excellent job of explaining the story itself, they could delve deeper into the theological implications of the parable and its relevance to modern Christian life.
