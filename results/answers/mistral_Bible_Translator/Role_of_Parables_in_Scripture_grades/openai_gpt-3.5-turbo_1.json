The student provides a detailed explanation of how Nathan used the parable to confront David about his sin with Bathsheba, demonstrating a clear understanding of the concept. The analysis is well-supported with specific references to the biblical text and highlights the wisdom and gentleness in Nathan's approach. Overall, a thorough and insightful response."
