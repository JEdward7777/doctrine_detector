 In 2 Samuel 12:1-7, Nathan the prophet utilized a parable as a subtle but effective means to confront King David about his sin with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah. The parable was intended to expose David's moral failing without directly accusing him.

In the story, Nathan tells David about two men: one rich and another poor. The rich man had many sheep and a little lamb, which he loved dearly. One day the rich man took this beloved lamb and prepared it for a meal. Meanwhile, the poor man had only one lamb – a pet – but it died. To the surprise of the rich man, when the poor man found out about his loss, the rich man did not give him his own cherished lamb to make up for it. Instead, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for a meal.

After Nathan finished telling this story, David was indignant at the rich man's injustice towards the poor man (2 Samuel 12:5-6). Nathan then revealed that this parable was about David himself and his sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12:7): "You are that man!" By using a parable, Nathan skillfully conveyed the gravity of David's sin without explicitly accusing him directly, making it easier for King David to acknowledge his guilt.

This parable serves as an example of a wise and gentle approach in addressing someone's moral shortcomings while preserving their dignity and promoting self-realization.
