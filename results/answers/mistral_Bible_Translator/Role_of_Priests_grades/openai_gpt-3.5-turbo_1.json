The answer aligns well with the biblical role of priests as outlined in Leviticus and Numbers, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic. However, there could have been a deeper exploration of how priests functioned as intermediaries between God and the people, emphasizing the significance of their role in facilitating the relationship between humanity and God through their duties."
