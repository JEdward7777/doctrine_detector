 In the Old Testament, priests had several key responsibilities as outlined primarily in the books of Leviticus and Numbers. Here are some of their main duties:

1. Offer sacrifices: Priests were responsible for offering various types of sacrifices on behalf of the Israelites to atone for sins and to maintain a relationship with God (Leviticus 1-7).

2. Maintain the Tabernacle/Temple: The priests were tasked with maintaining the sanctity of the Tabernacle in the wilderness and later, the Temple in Jerusalem (Numbers 3-4; Exodus 25-29). This included tending to the furnishings, the incense, and the sacred vessels.

3. Interpret God's will: Priests acted as intermediaries between God and the people, helping them understand God's commands and guidance (Leviticus 10:8-11).

4. Teach and instruct: As knowledgeable in the Law of Moses, priests were to teach the Israelites about God's laws and commandments (Leviticus 10:11; Deuteronomy 33:10).

5. Judgment and discernment: Priests were tasked with making decisions related to purity, ceremonial cleanliness, and moral conduct among the people (Leviticus 4:27, 16:2; Numbers 5:13-31).

6. Blessing and cursing: On special occasions, priests would bless the people of Israel or pronounce God's judgment upon them (Numbers 6:22-27).

7. Distributing tithes: The priests received a portion of the tithes brought by the people to support themselves and perform their duties in the Tabernacle/Temple (Numbers 18:20-32; Deuteronomy 12:5-19).
