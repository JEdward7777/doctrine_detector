However, the detailed explanation in the original answer regarding the specific duties of priests in offering sacrifices, maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple, interpreting God's will, teaching, judging, blessing/cursing, and distributing tithes is missing. To fully understand the biblical role of priests, it is important to recognize the comprehensive nature of their duties as outlined in the Old Testament."
