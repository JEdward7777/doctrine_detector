 In the Old Testament, priests had several key responsibilities as outlined primarily in the books of Leviticus and Numbers. Here are some of their main duties:

1. Offer sacrifices: Priests were responsible for offering various types of sacrifices on behalf of the Israelites to atone for sins and to maintain a relationship with God (Leviticus 1-7).

2. Maintain the Tabernacle/Temple: The priests were tasked with maintaining the sanctity of the Tabernacle in the wilderness and later, the Temple in Jerusalem (Numbers 3-4; Exodus 25-29). This included tending to the furnishings, the incense, and the sacred vessels.

3. Interpret God's will: Priests acted as intermediaries between God and the people, helping them understand God's commands and guidance (Leviticus 10:8-11).

4. Teach and instruct: As knowledgeable in the Law of Moses, priests were to teach the Israelites about God's laws and commandments (Leviticus 10:11; Deuteronomy 33:10).

5. Judgment and discernment: Priests were tasked with making decisions related to purity, ceremonial cleanliness, and moral conduct among the people (Leviticus 4:27, 16:2; Numbers 5:13-31).

6. Blessing and cursing: On special occasions, priests would bless the people of Israel or pronounce God's judgment upon them (Numbers 6:22-27).

7. Distributing tithes: The priests received a portion of the tithes brought by the people to support themselves and perform their duties in the Tabernacle/Temple (Numbers 18:20-32; Deuteronomy 12:5-19).

Comment: The response provides a general overview of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament, mentioning offering sacrifices, prayers, religious rites, blessings, and teaching God's laws. However, the detailed explanation in the original answer regarding the specific duties of priests in offering sacrifices, maintaining the Tabernacle/Temple, interpreting God's will, teaching, judging, blessing/cursing, and distributing tithes is missing. To fully understand the biblical role of priests, it is important to recognize the comprehensive nature of their duties as outlined in the Old Testament.
