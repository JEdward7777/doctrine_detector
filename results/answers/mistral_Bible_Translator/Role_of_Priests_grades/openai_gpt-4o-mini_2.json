The responsibilities mentioned align well with the biblical role of priests as outlined in the Old Testament. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly referencing the specific books of the Bible where these priestly duties are outlined, such as Leviticus and Numbers, to fully demonstrate an understanding of the biblical sources."
