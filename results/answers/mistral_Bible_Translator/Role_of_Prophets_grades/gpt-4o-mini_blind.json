It correctly highlights key aspects such as speaking on behalf of God, conveying messages, warnings, and promises, as well as calling people to repentance and righteousness. The inclusion of relevant biblical references strengthens the response. Great job overall with minor room for further elaboration on the specific relationship dynamics between the prophet, God, and the people."
