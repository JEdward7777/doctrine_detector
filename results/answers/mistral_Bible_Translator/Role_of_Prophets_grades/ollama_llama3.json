  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 80.\n\nThe response accurately conveys the primary role of a prophet as speaking God's messages to His people, warning them of sin and calling them to obedience. It also mentions that prophets often warn against judgment for disobedience, which is consistent with biblical teachings.\n\nHowever, the response lacks some nuance and depth in its understanding of prophetic ministry. For example, it does not mention the prophet's role as a messenger between God and humanity, nor does it highlight the balance between warning and hope that biblical prophets often exhibit.\n\nThe concern was to understand the biblical role of prophets and their messages, which this response partially addresses but could be expanded upon. Overall, I would give this response an 80 because while it provides some accurate information, it could benefit from a more comprehensive understanding of prophetic ministry as depicted in Scripture."
