## [Answer](../Role_of_Prophets.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Bible, the primary role of a prophet is to speak on behalf of God to His people, conveying His messages, judgments, warnings, and promises. A prophet serves as a messenger between God and humanity, communicating divine will and urging people to turn back to Him when they have strayed from His path (Isaiah 44:26, Jeremiah 1:5). They are also called to warn of impending judgment for disobedience but also to bring hope and promise for repentance and obedience. Prophets often speak truth to power, standing against injustice and calling people to righteousness (Amos 7:12-17).
