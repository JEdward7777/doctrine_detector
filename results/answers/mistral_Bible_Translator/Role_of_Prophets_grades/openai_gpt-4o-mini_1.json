  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response clearly articulates the primary role of a prophet in speaking God's messages to the people and emphasizes the importance of warning people to turn away from sin and obey God. It also references key biblical passages and themes related to the role of prophets. The only room for improvement would be to provide more specific examples or elaboration on how prophets fulfill their role in conveying God's messages effectively."
