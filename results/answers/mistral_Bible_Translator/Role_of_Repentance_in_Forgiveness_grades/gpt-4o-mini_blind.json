  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of the relationship between repentance and forgiveness in the Bible. The student accurately describes repentance as a turning away from sin and a commitment to follow God, supported by appropriate biblical references. They also explain forgiveness as God's act of pardoning based on His grace and mercy. The use of the parable of the prodigal son to illustrate this dynamic is apt. The response could be enhanced by further elaboration on the role of Jesus Christ in providing the ultimate means for forgiveness through His sacrifice. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound explanation."
