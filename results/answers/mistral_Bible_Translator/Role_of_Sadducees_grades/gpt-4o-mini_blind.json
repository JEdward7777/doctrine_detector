  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish Temple system during the Second Temple period. The student effectively covers various aspects such as Temple administration, interpreting laws, supporting priestly activities, opposing Pharisaical influence, and negotiating with Roman authorities. The explanation is detailed and well-structured, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, to improve the grade, the student could have further emphasized the Sadducees' role in specific Temple rituals and sacrifices, as well as elaborated on their beliefs regarding the afterlife and resurrection, which were key points of contention with the Pharisees."
