  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish Temple system. It provides a comprehensive overview of their roles in temple administration, law interpretation, priestly support, and interfacing with Roman authorities. The student's thoroughness and clarity in explaining these responsibilities are commendable. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on their influence on religious practices and their significance in the broader political and social context of the Second Temple period."
