 In the Jewish Temple system during the Second Temple period, the Sadducees were a prominent group, known for their adherence to the written Torah (Pentateuch) and their rejection of oral traditions. Their main responsibilities can be summarized as follows:

1. Temple Administration: The Sadducees held significant political power and controlled the administration of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. They were responsible for maintaining religious rituals, managing temple finances, and overseeing the daily operations of the Temple.

2. Interpreting Laws: As a priestly sect, they had a role in interpreting Jewish law, particularly laws related to Temple practices and offerings. The Sadducees were known for their strict interpretation of the written Torah without reference to oral tradition or later rabbinic interpretations.

3. Supporting Priestly Activities: The Sadducees supported priests in their duties, such as conducting sacrifices, maintaining the sanctity of the Temple, and ensuring that the priestly lineages were correctly observed. They also played a role in appointing high-ranking priests.

4. Opposing Pharisaical Influence: The Sadducees opposed the growing influence of the Pharisees and their teachings on oral law, resurrection, and angels. This opposition led to ongoing debates and tensions between these two groups during the Second Temple period.

5. Negotiating with Roman Authorities: As the political power in Palestine shifted towards Rome, the Sadducees were often tasked with negotiating with Roman authorities on behalf of the Jewish people, seeking to maintain Jewish autonomy within the Roman Empire. However, their cooperation with Rome led to criticism from other Jewish groups who favored a more nationalistic approach to Roman rule.

Overall, the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in the Jewish Temple system revolved around administering the Temple, interpreting Jewish law, supporting priests, opposing Pharisaical influence, and navigating relationships with Roman authorities. Their strict adherence to written Torah without oral tradition set them apart from other Jewish groups during this time period.

Comment: The response accurately identifies the main responsibilities of the Sadducees in taking care of the temple complex and performing priestly tasks like offering sacrifices. However, it lacks depth in exploring the broader historical context of religious leadership during the time of Jesus. Providing more background information on the Sadducees within the Second Temple period and their interactions with other Jewish groups would have enhanced the response.
