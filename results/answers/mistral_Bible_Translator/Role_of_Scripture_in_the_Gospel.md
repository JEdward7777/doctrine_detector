## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, we see several examples of the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message. Here are a few significant instances:

1. Jesus' Ministry (Matthew 26:54-56): When Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane, He said to those who had come to seize Him, "But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?" Here, Jesus is using the Old Testament prophecies to explain His impending crucifixion and resurrection.

2. Paul's Sermon at the Areopagus (Acts 17:2-3): In his speech to the Athenians, Paul quotes from several Greek philosophers and poets to make a connection with them. Then, he introduces God and His plan of redemption, using Scripture (Acts 17:25-31).

3. Peter's Sermon at Pentecost (Acts 2:14-21): On the Day of Pentecost, Peter quotes from Joel 2:28-32 to explain that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the disciples was a fulfillment of prophecy.

These examples demonstrate the importance of using Scripture in sharing the Gospel message. The Bible itself models this approach by connecting Old Testament prophecies with New Testament events and teachings. This method helps to establish the authority, relevance, and fulfillment of God's Word in both testaments.
