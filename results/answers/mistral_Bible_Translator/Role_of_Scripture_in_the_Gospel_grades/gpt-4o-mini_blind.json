  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: This answer provides good examples from the Bible illustrating the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message. It correctly references key events such as Jesus' ministry, Paul's sermon at the Areopagus, and Peter's sermon at Pentecost. The student effectively demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of using Scripture in evangelism. However, to enhance the answer, more detailed explanations or insights into how each instance uniquely showcases the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel could be included. Additionally, directly tying these examples back to the overarching theme of God's redemptive plan as revealed through Scripture would strengthen the theological depth of the response."
