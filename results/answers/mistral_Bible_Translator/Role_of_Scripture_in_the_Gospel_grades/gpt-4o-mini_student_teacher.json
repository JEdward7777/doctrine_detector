  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's response provides a good overview of how Scripture is used in sharing the Gospel message, citing specific examples from the Bible. However, the response could be improved by focusing more on the direct use of Scripture itself in evangelism, as emphasized in the teacher's answer. Additionally, tying in the importance of Scriptures in evangelism with a clearer emphasis on the integration of Scriptural truths could enhance the overall depth of the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
