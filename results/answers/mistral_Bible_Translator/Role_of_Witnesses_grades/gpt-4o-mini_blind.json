The student accurately highlights the significance of various witnesses such as the apostles, Mary Magdalene, Peter, and John, in attesting to the key events surrounding Jesus. The biblical references are well-incorporated to support the points made. However, there could have been a stronger emphasis on the theological significance of these witnesses in the broader context of Christian faith and doctrine. Overall, a solid and informative response."
