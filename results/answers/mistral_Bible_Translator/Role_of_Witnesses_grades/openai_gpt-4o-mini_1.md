## [Answer](../Role_of_Witnesses.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, witnesses play a significant role in attesting to the life, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The four Gospels - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John - provide various accounts of these events, with each Gospel emphasizing different aspects based on their unique perspectives.

The most notable witnesses of Jesus' life are the twelve apostles, whom Jesus chose to follow Him during His ministry (Matthew 10:2-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:13-16; John 6:70-71). However, three witnesses are particularly important in the Gospel accounts of Jesus' resurrection: Mary Magdalene, Peter, and John.

Mary Magdalene was a devoted follower of Jesus who witnessed His crucifixion (John 19:25) and was the first to encounter the empty tomb on the morning of the resurrection (John 20:1-18). She played an essential role in spreading the news about Jesus' resurrection to the other disciples (Matthew 28:9-10; Mark 16:9-11; John 20:18).

Peter, one of the original apostles, denied Jesus three times before His crucifixion but later played a crucial role in proclaiming the resurrection (Luke 24:34; Acts 1:3). He was present at the empty tomb with John and other disciples (John 20:2-10) and became one of the primary leaders in the early Christian community, preaching about Jesus' resurrection to the people (Acts 2:22-36; 3:15; 4:10).

John was also present at the crucifixion, standing near the cross with Mary (John 19:25-27), and he was the only disciple who did not abandon Jesus during His trial and crucifixion. He was the one whom Jesus entrusted to take care of His mother, Mary, after His death (John 19:26-27). John was also present at the empty tomb with Peter (John 20:2-10) and later wrote the Gospel of John, in which he provides detailed testimony about Jesus' resurrection.

These witnesses play an essential role in validating the events surrounding Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Their testimonies have been passed down through generations, becoming foundational for Christian faith and practice. The New Testament emphasizes the importance of having multiple witnesses to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the events it records (Matthew 18:16; John 8:17-18).
