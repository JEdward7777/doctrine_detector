  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and detailed explanation of the unique responsibilities of the high priest compared to other priests in Israel. They accurately highlighted key differences such as direct access to the Holy of Holies, special rituals and duties, serving as a representative of the people, and possessing moral authority. However, the student's response was more comprehensive than the reference answer provided by the teacher, demonstrating a strong understanding of the significance of the high priest's role in Israel's worship practices."
