  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 70.\n\nThe response accurately identifies one key aspect of the High Priest's role: direct access to the Holy of Holies for a special sacrifice on Yom Kippur. However, it falls short in not fully capturing the significance of the High Priest's role in Israelite worship practices. The answer does not mention the representative and mediator role of the High Priest, nor does it highlight the moral authority and blameless life expected of him.\n\nTo better address the concern, I would suggest adding more details about how the High Priest served as a mediator between God and the people, and how his moral authority and example-setting reflected his central role in maintaining spiritual wellbeing."
