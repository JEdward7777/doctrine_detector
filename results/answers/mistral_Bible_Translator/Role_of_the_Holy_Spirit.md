## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Christian theology, when a person is born again (a spiritual rebirth experienced through faith in Jesus Christ), the Holy Spirit dwells within them as a result of their confession and belief in Jesus. The Holy Spirit empowers a believer in several ways:

1. Sanctification: The Holy Spirit works to sanctify, or make holy, the believer by progressively transforming them into the image of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18). This process is not instantaneous but continues throughout the believer's lifetime as they grow in their relationship with God.

2. Guidance: The Holy Spirit guides believers in understanding truth, making decisions, and living a godly life (John 16:13, Galatians 5:18). He illuminates God's word to the believer so they may comprehend it and apply its teachings to their lives.

3. Gifts and Abilities: The Holy Spirit bestows spiritual gifts upon believers for the common good and edification of the church (1 Corinthians 12). These gifts include things like wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discernment, tongues, and interpretation.

4. Empowerment in Witnessing: The Holy Spirit empowers believers to share the gospel message effectively (Acts 1:8) and equips them with courage, boldness, and wisdom when they encounter opposition or obstacles while sharing their faith.

5. Prayer and Intercession: The Holy Spirit intercedes for believers, helping them in their prayers and bringing their petitions before God according to His will (Romans 8:26-27). This means that the Holy Spirit not only helps guide our prayers but also ensures that they are aligned with God's perfect plan.

6. Strength and Comfort: The Holy Spirit provides strength, comfort, and encouragement during difficult times, helping believers to persevere in their faith (John 14:26, John 16:33). This presence of the Holy Spirit serves as a constant reminder that God is always with them.

In summary, the Holy Spirit empowers believers by sanctifying them, guiding them, bestowing spiritual gifts, empowering their witness, interceding for them in prayer, and providing strength and comfort during difficult times. It is essential to note that experiencing these empowerments results from a deepening relationship with God through obedience, prayer, study of the Bible, and faithfulness.
