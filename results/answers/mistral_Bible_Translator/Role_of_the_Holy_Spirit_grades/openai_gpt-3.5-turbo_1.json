  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of how the Holy Spirit empowers believers in various aspects of their lives in accordance with Christian theology.

The only reason for not giving a perfect score is that it could have included a bit more direct reference to the initial statement about producing good spiritual fruit."
