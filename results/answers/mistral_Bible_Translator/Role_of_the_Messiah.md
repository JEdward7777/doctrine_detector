## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Bible, the Messiah (who is also known as Jesus Christ) fulfilled several crucial roles:

1. Savior: The Messiah came to save humanity from sin and its consequences. He did this by living a sinless life and dying on the cross in our place, paying the penalty for our sins (Romans 3:24-26; 5:8).

2. Redeemer: The Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us (Galatians 3:13). He also purchased us back for God with his own blood (Acts 20:28).

3. Prophet: The Messiah was a prophet like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:15-19), but greater than any prophet before him. He fulfilled many Old Testament prophecies about the coming of the Messiah, such as being born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2) and riding on a donkey into Jerusalem (Zechariah 9:9).

4. Priest: The Messiah functioned as our High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16). He offered himself as the perfect sacrifice for our sins, thus making us acceptable to God.

5. King: The Messiah is the promised King of Israel who would reign forever (2 Samuel 7:12-16; Isaiah 9:6-7). His kingdom is not of this world, but a spiritual one (John 18:36).

6. Lord: The Messiah is Lord over all, including both Jews and Gentiles (Philippians 2:9-11). All must acknowledge him as such and submit to his rule in our lives.

7. Teacher: The Messiah taught with authority, unlike the teachers of religious law (Matthew 7:28-29; Mark 1:22). His teachings provide guidance for living a godly life.

8. Healer: The Messiah had power to heal physical illnesses and cast out demons (Matthew 4:23-24; Mark 1:34). This demonstrated his divine nature and compassion for humanity.

9. Bread of Life: The Messiah said, "I am the bread of life" (John 6:35), referring to himself as the source of spiritual nourishment for all people.

10. Light of the World: The Messiah said, "I am the light of the world" (John 8:12), implying that he provides spiritual illumination to guide us through life.

11. Lamb of God: The Messiah is referred to as the "Lamb of God" who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). This alludes to the Old Testament Passover lamb, whose blood saved the Israelites from death in Egypt. Jesus' sacrificial death provides spiritual salvation for believers.

12. Son of God: The Messiah is the unique Son of God (Luke 1:35), both human and divine, sent by God to save humanity. He demonstrated his sonship through miracles, teaching, and ultimately, his resurrection from the dead.

These roles emphasize the Messiah's significance as the central figure in Christian theology and salvation history.
