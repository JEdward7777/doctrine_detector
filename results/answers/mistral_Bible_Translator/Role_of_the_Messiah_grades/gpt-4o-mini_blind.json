The student effectively references relevant Bible verses to support each role described. However, some minor improvements could include further elaboration on the significance of each role in relation to Christian doctrine and salvation history. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the Old Testament prophecies and their fulfillment in Jesus Christ could enhance the depth of the response. Overall, a well-written and informative answer."
