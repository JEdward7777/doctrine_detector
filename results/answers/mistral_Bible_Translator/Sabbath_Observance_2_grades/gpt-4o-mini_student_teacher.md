## [Answer](../Sabbath_Observance_2.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Book of Exodus, chapter 16, verses 23 to 30, it is recorded how God provided manna for the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness. Regarding the gathering of manna on the Sabbath day, God gave specific instructions. On the sixth day, they were instructed to gather twice as much as usual because on the Sabbath day, no manna would be found (Exodus 16:26). This was a way to ensure that the Israelites observed the Sabbath rest by not having to collect manna. The double portion of manna collected on the sixth day would suffice for two days (Saturday and Sunday), allowing the Israelites to rest on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath according to God's commandments.
