However, to enhance the Christian perspective, it could have included the fulfillment of the Sabbath in Jesus Christ (Matthew 12:8) and the importance of finding rest in Him (Hebrews 4:9-10) as believers today. This additional insight would further enrich the understanding of the Sabbath's implications for daily Christian living."
