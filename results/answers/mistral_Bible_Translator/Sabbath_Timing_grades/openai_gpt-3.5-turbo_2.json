The mention of Leviticus 23:32 and Genesis 2:2-3 adds depth to the understanding of why the Sabbath begins at sunset on Friday and ends at sunset on Saturday. The only minor improvement would be to explicitly mention the importance of resting, reflecting, and worshiping on the Sabbath to further emphasize its significance in Jewish tradition."
