  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student provided a detailed explanation of the belief of the Sadducees regarding the resurrection and effectively contrasted it with Christian teaching. They referenced relevant Biblical passages and explained the theological implications of the differences in beliefs. The student demonstrated a good understanding of the subject matter and effectively communicated the differences in beliefs and their implications for faith.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to directly state the contrast with the Christian teaching in a more concise and direct manner, similar to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
