## [Answer](../Sadducees_and_Resurrection.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Sadducees were a conservative Jewish sect in ancient Israel during the Second Temple period. They rejected the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and the concept of an afterlife or resurrection, which is in stark contrast to Christian teachings.

According to the Bible, the Sadducees held their position based on a literal interpretation of the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) where no mention of an afterlife or resurrection is made. In the New Testament, we can find instances where Jesus disagreed with the Sadducees on this matter, as seen in Matthew 22:23-33 and Mark 12:18-27.

In these passages, the Sadducees present a hypothetical scenario about a woman who married seven brothers during her lifetime according to Jewish law, assuming that there will be no resurrection. Jesus then counters their argument by stating that in the resurrection people will not marry or be given in marriage but will be like angels in heaven (Matthew 22:30).

Christian teaching, as found in both the Old and New Testaments, affirms the belief in the resurrection of the dead. For example, the Book of Daniel prophesies about the resurrection of the righteous (Daniel 12:2), and Jesus himself speaks extensively about the resurrection throughout the New Testament, such as in John 5:28-29 and 1 Corinthians 15:12-23.

In summary, while the Sadducees denied the belief in the resurrection of the dead, Christianity affirms the concept of the resurrection as an essential part of its teachings about life after death, based on both Old and New Testament scriptures.
