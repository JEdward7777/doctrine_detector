It effectively addresses the concern of understanding these differences and the implications for faith, showing a clear contrast in beliefs and citing relevant biblical passages to support the explanation. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the significance of the resurrection in Christian faith as being not only for believers, but also central to the resurrection of Jesus Christ as a foundational belief in Christianity."
