It connects Samson's adherence to the Nazirite vow, particularly the prohibition against cutting his hair, to his strength and the significance of the vow in his life. The connection between personal commitment to God's commands and the fulfillment of divine purposes is clearly articulated and supported by relevant examples from the story of Samson."
