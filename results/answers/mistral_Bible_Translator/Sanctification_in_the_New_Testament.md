## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, the process of sanctification (becoming holy or set apart for God) for believers in Jesus Christ is described as a progressive work of grace that occurs throughout their lifetime. This transformation is initiated at salvation and continues until the believer is either physically present with the Lord or until they are glorified (depending on one's view of the intermediate state).

The sanctification process involves the Holy Spirit working in the life of the believer to conform them more and more into the image of Christ. This transformation occurs as the believer obeys God's Word, walks by faith, and seeks to grow in their knowledge and understanding of Jesus.

Some key passages that describe this process include:

1. Romans 6:4-5 - "Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life."
2. Philippians 2:12-13 - "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who works in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
3. 1 Thessalonians 4:3 - "For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality."
4. Hebrews 12:14 - "Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord."
5. 2 Corinthians 3:18 - "But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord."

It is important to note that sanctification is not something that can be achieved through human effort or self-will alone. Rather, it is the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer who cooperates with Him through faith and obedience. The ultimate goal of sanctification is to be made more like Jesus and to bring glory to God.
