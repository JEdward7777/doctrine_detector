The student effectively communicates the progressive nature of sanctification, the role of the Holy Spirit, and the importance of obedience and faith in the believer's transformation. The inclusion of key passages and the emphasis on the collaborative effort between the believer and the Holy Spirit are particularly commendable. Well done!"
