  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThis response provides a clear and accurate summary of the New Testament teaching on sanctification, highlighting its progressive nature and the role of the Holy Spirit in conforming believers to Christ's image. The inclusion of specific Scripture passages supports the writer's claims and adds depth to their understanding. Additionally, the emphasis on the importance of cooperation with God through faith and obedience is a significant strength.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to further develop the idea that sanctification is not just a process but also a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. While this is implicit in the response, it could be made more explicit by highlighting the intimacy and dependence on God that comes with the process of sanctification.\n\nOverall, however, this is an excellent response that demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical teaching on sanctification and its connection to faith."
