  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the term 'sanctuary' in the context of the Bible by mentioning its association with sacred places like the Tabernacle and Temple, as well as its metaphorical meaning related to God's presence and the believer's spiritual state. The student also provided a relevant biblical reference to support their explanation.\n\nHowever, the student's answer could be improved by emphasizing the aspect of protection and safety that the term 'sanctuary' conveys in the Biblical context, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. Focusing more on this aspect would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the term.\n\nOverall, the student's response is well-informed and detailed, but could benefit from addressing the concern of protection and safety associated with the term 'sanctuary' in the Bible."
