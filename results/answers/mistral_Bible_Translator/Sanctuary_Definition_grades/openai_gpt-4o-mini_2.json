  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the term 'sanctuary' in the Biblical context, referencing the Tabernacle, Temple, and God's presence among His people. The addition of the metaphorical use of 'sanctuary' to describe the believer's spiritual state is a thoughtful insight. The response effectively captures the significance of the term within a Christian worldview. However, to improve, incorporating additional scriptural references or examples could enrich the explanation further."
