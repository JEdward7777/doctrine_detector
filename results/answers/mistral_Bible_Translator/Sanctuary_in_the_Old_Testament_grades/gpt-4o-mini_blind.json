  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a detailed and accurate explanation of how God described the sanctuary in relation to His people in the Old Testament. The student effectively articulates the significance of the Tabernacle, its various components, and its symbolic representation of God's covenantal relationship with Israel. Additionally, the interpretation of the sanctuary in Christian theology as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ is well-stated. The response could be enhanced by incorporating additional scriptural references to support the points made."
