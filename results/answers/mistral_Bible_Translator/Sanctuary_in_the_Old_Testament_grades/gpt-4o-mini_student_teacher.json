  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of how God described the sanctuary in the Old Testament, highlighting its significance in God's dwelling among His people and the symbolic representations within the sanctuary. The student effectively connected the sanctuary to God's covenantal relationship with Israel and drew a parallel to Jesus Christ as the ultimate fulfillment. However, the student could have emphasized more explicitly the aspect of the sanctuary as a safe place for God's people, as stated in the reference answer."
