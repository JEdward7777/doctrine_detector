# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, God describes the sanctuary (also known as the Tabernacle and later the Temple) as a sacred place where He would dwell among His people Israel. The sanctuary served as a physical manifestation of God's presence and was designed according to specific instructions given to Moses by God on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25-40).

The Tabernacle consisted of three main parts: the outer courtyard, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place. The outer courtyard was open to all who approached, but only priests could enter the Holy Place, where the Table of Showbread, the Golden Lampstand, and the Altar of Incense were located. The Most Holy Place, also known as the Holy of Holies, was accessible only by the high priest once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). Inside was the Ark of the Covenant, which held the Ten Commandments and represented God's presence among His people.

Throughout the Old Testament, the sanctuary is portrayed as a symbol of God's covenantal relationship with Israel. It served as a reminder that God chose them to be His special people and dwelled among them, setting them apart for a holy purpose. The sanctuary also represented the importance of obedience, sacrifice, and atonement in maintaining this relationship with God.

In Christian theology, the sanctuary (and later the Temple) is often interpreted as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, the true Tabernacle not made by human hands (Hebrews 8:2; 9:11). As the Son of God, Jesus is seen as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to dwell among His people, providing atonement for their sins through His sacrifice on the cross.
