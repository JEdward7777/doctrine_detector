It effectively connects the concept of the sanctuary to God's covenantal relationship with Israel and the broader theological implications in Christian theology concerning Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment. The biblical references and acknowledgment of the sanctuary's representation of obedience, sacrifice, and atonement further enhance the depth of the response."
