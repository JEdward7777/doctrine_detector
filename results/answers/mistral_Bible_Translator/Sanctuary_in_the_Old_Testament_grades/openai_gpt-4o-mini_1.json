It also effectively connects the Old Testament understanding of the sanctuary to its Christian theological interpretation as a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ. The answer could have further emphasized the idea that the sanctuary was not only a physical place but also a symbolic representation of God's presence and the covenantal relationship with His people."
