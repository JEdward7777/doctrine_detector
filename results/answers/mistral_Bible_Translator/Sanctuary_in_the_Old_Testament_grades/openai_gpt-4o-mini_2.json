The inclusion of how the sanctuary is viewed in Christian theology as foreshadowing Jesus Christ adds depth to the understanding of the sanctuary's importance. The connection between the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people is well-highlighted and supported throughout the response. Overall, a strong Christian worldview perspective is applied effectively."
