  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-detailed and accurate explanation of the fate of Satan and his followers in hell based on biblical references. They have demonstrated a solid understanding of Christian theology and supported their points with relevant scripture verses. The inclusion of the importance of free will and the acknowledgement of theological complexities shows a mature perspective on the topic. Overall, a strong response."
