  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is well-researched and clearly explains the biblical basis for the fate of Satan and his followers in hell. It also acknowledges the complexity of theology and encourages students to seek guidance from spiritual leaders. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples from scripture to support the claims made."
