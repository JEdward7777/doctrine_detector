## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, there are several verses that highlight the practice of intercession. Here are a few examples:

1. Romans 8:34 - "Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us." This verse emphasizes the ongoing intercession of Jesus on behalf of believers.

2. 1 Timothy 2:1-2 - "I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior." This passage encourages believers to pray for everyone, including leaders, as an act of intercession.

3. Hebrews 7:25 - "Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them." This verse reinforces Jesus' continual role as an intercessor for those who come to God through Him.

4. Romans 15:30-33 - "And so I urge you to pray for us, for the sake of our Lord. Pray that God’s will may be done in every way. May he lead us to share with one another and with everyone else in need. Our help comes from God, who made heaven and earth, and from God we can expect help with everything we need. And we do this because we want you to join with us in the ministry of giving to the Lord. You will be enriching not only yourselves but many others as well." Here, the apostle Paul asks for the prayers (intercession) of the Roman believers on his behalf and that of his fellow workers.

These verses demonstrate both the example set by Jesus and the encouragement given to believers to engage in intercessory prayer for one another and those in positions of authority.
