  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a strong response by referencing specific verses that highlight the practice of intercession in the New Testament. They effectively connected each verse to the concept of intercessory prayer and explained its significance for believers. However, the reference answer provided by the teacher may have included more relevant verses, which could have enhanced the depth of the student's analysis. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
