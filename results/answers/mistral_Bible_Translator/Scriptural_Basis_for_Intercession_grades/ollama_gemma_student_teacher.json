  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of intercession and provides relevant biblical passages to support their claims. They also connect the practice of intercession to the example set by Jesus and encourage believers to engage in intercessory prayer for one another and those in positions of authority. However, the student's response could benefit from including more specific examples of intercession from the scriptures."
