  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and biblical exploration of the practice of intercession, highlighting multiple verses that demonstrate Jesus' ongoing role as an intercessor and encouraging believers to engage in intercessory prayer for one another and those in positions of authority. While the provided answer does not exactly match the given response (Hebrews 7:25-26 is mentioned, but not in isolation), the concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession is effectively addressed through a nuanced biblical analysis. The only reason I did not give a perfect score is that the original response did not directly address the provided answer, which might have been done by drawing parallels or contrasts between the two sets of verses. Overall, however, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of Scripture and its relevance to intercession, making it a compelling example for believers seeking guidance on prayer and intercession."
