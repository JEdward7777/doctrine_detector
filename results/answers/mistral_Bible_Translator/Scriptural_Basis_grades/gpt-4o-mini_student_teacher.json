  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a strong understanding of the concept of propitiation and included relevant Bible verses to support their explanation. However, the student missed referencing 1 John 4:10 in their response, which the teacher identified as a key verse. Overall, the student demonstrated a good grasp of the concept and its biblical foundation."
