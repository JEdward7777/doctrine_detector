The references are relevant and accurate, highlighting Jesus' sacrifice as an act of appeasement for humanity's sins. The explanation is also straightforward, making it easy to understand.\n\nHowever, the concern was to connect the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding. While the response does provide some biblical references, it would be more effective if it explained how these verses demonstrate the concept of propitiation in a more explicit and detailed manner. For example, the response could elaborate on how specific words or phrases in each verse support the idea that Jesus' sacrifice is an act of propitiation.\n\nOverall, the response shows a good understanding of the concept of propitiation and its biblical basis, but could be improved by providing a more in-depth analysis of the relevant verses."
