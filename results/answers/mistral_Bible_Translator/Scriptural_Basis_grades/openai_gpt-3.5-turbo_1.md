# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The concept of propitiation, which is the act of appeasing or satisfying God's wrath through sacrifice, is an essential part of Christian theology. Here are a few Bible verses that explain this concept:

1. Romans 3:25 - "God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood."

2. Romans 5:9-10 - "Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him! For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!"

3. 1 John 2:2 - "He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."

4. Romans 5:11 - "Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation."

These verses demonstrate that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was an act of propitiation, appeasing God's wrath for humanity's sins. Through faith in Jesus, people are reconciled to God and saved from eternal punishment.
