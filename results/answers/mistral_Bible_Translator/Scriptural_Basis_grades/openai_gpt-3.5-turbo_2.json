  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the theological concept of propitiation with relevant biblical references, providing a solid foundation for understanding the topic within a Christian worldview. The explanation is clear, supported by key verses, and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept. The only minor suggestion would be to include a bit more explanation or commentary on each verse to further deepen the understanding, hence the deduction from a perfect score."
