The references to John 3:16, 1 John 2:15-17, and Romans 12:2 are particularly well-explained. However, there could be more emphasis on the fallen nature of the world due to sin, and the need for believers to be salt and light in the world by living out their faith boldly. Additionally, integrating the notion of being in the world but not of the world as taught by Jesus in passages like John 17:14-16 would enhance the completeness of the response."
