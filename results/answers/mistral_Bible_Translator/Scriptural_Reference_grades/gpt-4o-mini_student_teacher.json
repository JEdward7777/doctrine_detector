  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer, citing relevant Bible passages that address the concept of \"the world\" in relation to believers. They appropriately connected these passages to the concern of navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values. However, the student's answer could have been more focused on directly addressing the concern and providing practical guidance or application based on the biblical passages cited."
