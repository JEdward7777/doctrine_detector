  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid analysis of Matthew 23:27-28, accurately highlighting the emphasis on the internal condition of the heart rather than outward appearances. The response effectively connects the teachings on iniquity, righteousness, and hypocrisy within the passage. The only area for improvement would be to potentially delve deeper into the theological implications of iniquity and its consequences in light of Biblical teachings."
