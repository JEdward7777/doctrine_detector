  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the nature of iniquity portrayed in Matthew 23:27-28, focusing on the internal condition of the heart versus outward appearances. The response effectively highlights the danger of hypocrisy and the importance of genuine righteousness. However, the answer could have been more concise and directly addressed the concern of pursuing genuine holiness in the Christian faith. A stronger connection to the specified concern would have further enhanced the response."
