## Question [Scriptural References 3](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_3.md)
What do passages like Matthew 23:27-28 teach us about the nature of iniquity?

## Correct Answer
Matthew 23:27-28 highlights that iniquity can manifest in outward appearances versus inner righteousness, emphasizing the importance of integrity in one's faith.

## Stated Concern
This serves as a reminder for Christians to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Matthew 23:27-28, Jesus speaks about the hypocrisy and wickedness of the Pharisees and scribes. The specific verses read:

"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Even so, you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness."

From these verses, we can learn that iniquity (sin or lawlessness) is not merely an external appearance of righteousness, but it involves the internal condition of the heart. The Pharisees and scribes were outwardly religious and obeyed the laws, but they lacked genuine righteousness because their hearts were filled with hypocrisy (deceitfulness) and lawlessness (sin).

This passage teaches us that true righteousness is not just about outward appearances, but it is rooted in a heart that sincerely loves and obeys God. It also shows the danger of hypocrisy, as it deceives both ourselves and others, leading to a destructive life devoid of God's blessings and eternal salvation.

In summary, this passage teaches us about the nature of iniquity by revealing that true righteousness is rooted in the heart, not just the outward appearance, and hypocrisy and lawlessness are manifestations of iniquity that lead to spiritual destruction.
