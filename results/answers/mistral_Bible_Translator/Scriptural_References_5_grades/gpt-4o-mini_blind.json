  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation supported by relevant New Testament verses, primarily from Jesus' teachings and Paul's letters, that clearly demonstrate the shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place to a location associated with the unrighteous. The connections made between the verses and the interpretation presented align well with Christian theological perspectives on the concept of Hades. Great job!"
