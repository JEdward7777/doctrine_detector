## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_5.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The New Testament verses that indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous can be found primarily in the teachings of Jesus and the letters of Paul. Here are some key verses:

1. Luke 10:15 (Jesus' teaching): "And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to Hades." In this verse, Jesus uses Hades as a place of punishment for a specific city, implying it is not a neutral place.

2. Luke 16:23 (Parable of Lazarus and the Rich Man): "In Hades, where he was in torment." Here, Hades is associated with a state of torment for the rich man, suggesting it is not a peaceful resting place but a place of punishment.

3. Acts 2:27 (Quotation from Psalm 16): "For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, nor let your Holy One see corruption." In this verse, Paul quotes Psalm 16, and in the original Hebrew, Sheol, a term often translated as Hades, is associated with death and the grave, but not necessarily a neutral place.

4. 1 Peter 3:19 (Dispute over the flood): "In which [the spirits in prison] he went and made proclamation to the spirits who had been made captive in disobedience when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water." Here, Peter speaks of spirits being held in Hades due to their disobedience, suggesting it is a place of punishment.

These verses, among others, indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous. This interpretation is further supported by the concept of paradise or heaven as a contrasting destination for the righteous.
