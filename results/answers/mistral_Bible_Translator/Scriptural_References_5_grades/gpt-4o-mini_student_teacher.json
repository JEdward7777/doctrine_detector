  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 85. \n\nThe student provided a thorough explanation supported by relevant New Testament verses that indicate a shift in the understanding of Hades. They referenced teachings of Jesus and Paul, connecting specific verses to the shift towards associating Hades with the unrighteous. The student also acknowledged the contrasting destination for the righteous, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic.\n\nHowever, the student could have placed more emphasis on the specific verses indicated in the reference answer for a more precise response. Additionally, they could have delved deeper into the implication for Christian eschatology, as per the specified concern. Overall, a solid effort with room for slight improvement in alignment with the reference answer and the concern provided."
