  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer is well-organized and provides clear evidence from the New Testament to support the claim that the understanding of Hades shifted from a neutral place to one associated with the unrighteous. The inclusion of relevant verses and their interpretations demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical text. The student's reasoning is logical and consistent with a Christian worldview."
