  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nThe student provided a thorough response with multiple relevant biblical passages that describe the characteristics of fools and foolish behaviors. They made insightful connections between the passages and highlighted key points for Christians to remain vigilant against foolishness in their lives. However, they did not include the specific passages mentioned in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Making those connections would have strengthened the answer further. Overall, a solid effort in relating biblical insights to practical Christian living."
