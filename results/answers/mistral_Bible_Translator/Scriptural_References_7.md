1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11 both present powerful images of exaltation within the Christian faith, emphasizing humility and obedience as keys to attaining such a position.

In 1 Peter 5:5-7, the Apostle Peter addresses the elders among the Christian community, encouraging them to clothe themselves with humility, for "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." (v.5) He then goes on to explain that God resists the devil and those who are arrogant, but provides a way for those who have suffered as Christ suffered to inherit salvation. (v.9) This passage suggests that God exalts those who are humble and follow in the footsteps of Jesus, even if it means suffering.

Philippians 2:9-11 presents the famous hymn about Jesus, which describes His exaltation following His earthly life and ministry. It begins by stating that Christ "made himself nothing," taking on the form of a servant and humbling himself by becoming obedient to deathâ€”even death on a cross. (v.7-8) As a result, God highly exalted Him and gave Him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (vv.9-11) This passage highlights the idea that through selfless humility and obedience to God's will, even to the point of suffering and death, individuals can be exalted by God and receive eternal glory.

In summary, both 1 Peter 5:5-7 and Philippians 2:9-11 illustrate that true exaltation in the Christian faith comes through humility, obedience to God, and a willingness to suffer for His will. By following in the footsteps of Jesus, believers can expect God's grace and eventual exaltation, as demonstrated by the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.
