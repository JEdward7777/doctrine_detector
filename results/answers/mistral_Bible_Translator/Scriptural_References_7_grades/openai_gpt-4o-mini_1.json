The explanation is clear, well-supported by scriptural references, and aligns with Christian teachings on humility, obedience, and exaltation. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of following in Jesus' footsteps as a central aspect of how believers can experience exaltation through humility and obedience."
