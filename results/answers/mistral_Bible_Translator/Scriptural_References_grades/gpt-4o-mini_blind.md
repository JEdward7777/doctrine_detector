## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham can be found in Genesis 17:1, where it says, "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, 'I am Almighty God; walk before me faithfully and blamelessly.'"

In the original Hebrew text, the phrase used for "Almighty" is "El Shaddai." This phrase appears four times in Genesis, all in reference to God's interactions with Abraham. The name signifies God's sufficiency, power, and provision, emphasizing His capacity to meet the needs of His people.

It's important to note that translations may vary, but most English versions use "Almighty" or "God Almighty" to capture the meaning of this name for God.

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham, citing the specific verse in Genesis (Genesis 17:1) and elaborating on the significance of the name "El Shaddai" in the original Hebrew text. The explanation of the meaning behind the name and its emphasis on God's sufficiency and power is doctrinally sound. The answer could have been enhanced by discussing further implications or applications of God's identity as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham, but overall, it displays a solid understanding of the biblical reference.
