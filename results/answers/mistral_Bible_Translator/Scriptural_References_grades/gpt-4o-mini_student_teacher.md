## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham can be found in Genesis 17:1, where it says, "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, 'I am Almighty God; walk before me faithfully and blamelessly.'"

In the original Hebrew text, the phrase used for "Almighty" is "El Shaddai." This phrase appears four times in Genesis, all in reference to God's interactions with Abraham. The name signifies God's sufficiency, power, and provision, emphasizing His capacity to meet the needs of His people.

It's important to note that translations may vary, but most English versions use "Almighty" or "God Almighty" to capture the meaning of this name for God.
