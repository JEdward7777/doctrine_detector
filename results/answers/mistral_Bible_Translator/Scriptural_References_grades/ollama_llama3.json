  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response correctly identifies the biblical reference to \"Almighty\" in Genesis 17:1, which aligns with the target answer. Additionally, it provides some context about the meaning and significance of the name \"El Shaddai\", which is relevant to knowing biblical references.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response could be more comprehensive. For example, it doesn't explicitly state how understanding this reference deepens our connection to Scripture and God's promises, as requested in the concern. Furthermore, while the response provides some helpful information about the meaning of \"El Shaddai\", it could benefit from further exploration of its implications for our relationship with God.\n\nOverall, I would encourage the writer to continue developing their understanding of biblical references and their significance in deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises."
