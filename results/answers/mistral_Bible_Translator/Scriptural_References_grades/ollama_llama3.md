## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The reference to God as "Almighty" in relation to Abraham can be found in Genesis 17:1, where it says, "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, 'I am Almighty God; walk before me faithfully and blamelessly.'"

In the original Hebrew text, the phrase used for "Almighty" is "El Shaddai." This phrase appears four times in Genesis, all in reference to God's interactions with Abraham. The name signifies God's sufficiency, power, and provision, emphasizing His capacity to meet the needs of His people.

It's important to note that translations may vary, but most English versions use "Almighty" or "God Almighty" to capture the meaning of this name for God.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response correctly identifies the biblical reference to "Almighty" in Genesis 17:1, which aligns with the target answer. Additionally, it provides some context about the meaning and significance of the name "El Shaddai", which is relevant to knowing biblical references.

However, I deduct a few points because the response could be more comprehensive. For example, it doesn't explicitly state how understanding this reference deepens our connection to Scripture and God's promises, as requested in the concern. Furthermore, while the response provides some helpful information about the meaning of "El Shaddai", it could benefit from further exploration of its implications for our relationship with God.

Overall, I would encourage the writer to continue developing their understanding of biblical references and their significance in deepening our connection to Scripture and God's promises.
