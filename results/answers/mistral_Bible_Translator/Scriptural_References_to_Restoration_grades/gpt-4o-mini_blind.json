The references to both the Old and New Testaments show a good understanding of how this theme runs throughout the entire Bible. The inclusion of verses such as Matthew 18:21-22 and 2 Corinthians 5:17 demonstrates the student's incorporation of Jesus' teachings and the New Testament perspective on restoration. Overall, an excellent response that demonstrates a deep knowledge of biblical themes and teachings."
