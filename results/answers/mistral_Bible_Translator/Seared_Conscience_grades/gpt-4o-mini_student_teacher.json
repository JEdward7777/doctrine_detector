  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a good explanation of the concept of a seared conscience and its implications for a believer, highlighting the importance of repentance and faith in Jesus Christ for restoration. However, the student's answer could have been improved by focusing more on the specific aspect of insensitivity to sin which is key in understanding a seared conscience from a Christian worldview. Emphasizing this aspect would have strengthened their response and alignment with the concern provided."
