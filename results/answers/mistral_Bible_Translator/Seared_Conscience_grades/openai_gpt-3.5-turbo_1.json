It appropriately addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the state of one's conscience for spiritual vigilance and integrity. The response could be further strengthened by including more explicit connections to the role of confession, repentance, and reliance on the Holy Spirit for restoration and renewal of the conscience."
