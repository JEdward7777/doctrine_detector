The student correctly identifies this event as the second coming of Christ and ties it to passages in the Bible. They also highlight the importance of remaining vigilant and faithful in preparation for this event. To further improve, the student could strengthen their explanation by referencing additional relevant Scriptures and elaborating on the theological implications for believers in a deeper manner."
