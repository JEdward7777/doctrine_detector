  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer an 85.\n\nThe student accurately explains the prophecy of Jesus' second coming as the \"Son of Man\" and highlights the significance of this event for believers. They mention the establishment of God's kingdom, the rapture, and the need for believers to remain faithful and watchful.\n\nHowever, the student could have delved deeper into the specific implications of Jesus' return as the \"Son of Man\" on Christian hope and eschatology, as per the concerned provided. Their answer could have been more focused on how this event shapes Christian beliefs about the end times and the final judgment.\n\nOverall, the student provides a solid response but could enhance it by directly addressing the concern specified by the teacher."
