## [Answer](../Second_Coming.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The statement made by Jesus about the "Son of Man" coming back on the clouds, as found in various passages such as Matthew 24:30, Mark 13:26, and Luke 21:27, is a prophecy that speaks to the second coming of Christ. This event signifies the end of the age and the culmination of God's plan for humanity.

   For believers, Jesus' return on the clouds serves as a comforting reminder that God will ultimately bring justice and righteousness in the world and establish His eternal kingdom. It also signifies the rapture, where those who have accepted Christ as their savior will be taken up to be with Him (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).

   Therefore, it is essential for believers to remain vigilant, watchful, and faithful in their walk with God, as they await the return of the Son of Man. This event will bring salvation and eternal life to those who have placed their faith in Jesus Christ.
