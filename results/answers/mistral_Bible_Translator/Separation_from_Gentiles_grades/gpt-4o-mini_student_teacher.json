  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's response a grade of 90. The student provided a detailed and well-supported answer that effectively explains the Pharisees' concern about separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles based on their interpretation of God's laws and scriptures. The student also appropriately highlighted the Pharisees' motivation to preserve their religious identity and practices. The only slight deduction could be that the student mentioned the Pharisees' understanding evolving over time without direct evidence, which is not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, it is a strong response from a Christian worldview."
