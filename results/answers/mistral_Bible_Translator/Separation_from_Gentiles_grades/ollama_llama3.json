  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response accurately summarizes the Pharisees' concern about separating themselves from Gentiles to maintain their religious purity and adherence to Jewish laws and traditions. The mention of specific biblical passages (Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus again) adds depth and credibility to the explanation.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the cultural context in which the Pharisees were operating. While it's mentioned that their understanding may have evolved over time, a more explicit exploration of how the social, political, and cultural factors influenced their views would enhance the response.\n\nOverall, however, this response effectively addresses the concern about the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context, and provides a clear and concise explanation of their motivations."
