## [Answer](../Separation_from_Gentiles.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Pharisees, as a religious group within Judaism during the Second Temple period (circa 516 BCE - 70 CE), emphasized strict adherence to Jewish law and tradition. Their primary concern with separating the Jewish people from the Gentiles was rooted in their interpretation of God's laws, as outlined in the Hebrew Bible.

In Leviticus 19:28 and Deuteronomy 7:3-4, it is stated that Jews should not adopt the customs or religious practices of other nations. The Pharisees believed that such interactions could lead to compromise and assimilation, which they saw as a threat to their identity as God's chosen people and the preservation of their distinct religious practices.

Additionally, the Pharisees interpreted certain scriptures to mean that the Gentiles were unclean or impure (Leviticus 18:24-30; Numbers 33:55). By avoiding contact with Gentiles, they believed they could maintain their own purity and holiness.

It's important to note that this separation was not intended as discrimination or xenophobia but rather as a means of preserving the unique identity and spirituality of the Jewish people. However, this understanding may have evolved over time and been influenced by various social, political, and cultural factors in their historical context.

90.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 90.

The response accurately summarizes the Pharisees' concern about separating themselves from Gentiles to maintain their religious purity and adherence to Jewish laws and traditions. The mention of specific biblical passages (Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Leviticus again) adds depth and credibility to the explanation.

The only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the cultural context in which the Pharisees were operating. While it's mentioned that their understanding may have evolved over time, a more explicit exploration of how the social, political, and cultural factors influenced their views would enhance the response.

Overall, however, this response effectively addresses the concern about the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith in a diverse cultural context, and provides a clear and concise explanation of their motivations.
