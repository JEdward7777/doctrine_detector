The explanation is grounded in biblical references and accurately portrays the Pharisees' intentions in relation to their faith. The only slight deduction is for not explicitly linking the concern to a broader Christian worldview perspective, such as emphasizing the Pharisees' focus on outward adherence to laws rather than internal transformation of the heart in accordance with Jesus' teachings."
