It not only elaborates on how Christians can serve God through teaching, caring for the sick, and providing for the poor but also expands on specific roles within ministry as outlined in the Bible. The inclusion of actionable ways for Christians to engage in ministry effectively addresses the concern by offering a practical guide for living out one's faith and commitments."
