## [Answer](../Service_to_God.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the New Testament, Christians can serve God in various ministries in accordance with their spiritual gifts and calling. Here are some key roles and responsibilities mentioned:

1. Apostles (Acts 1:21-26; Ephesians 4:11): They were original witnesses of Jesus' life, teachings, and resurrection. Today, apostles serve as missionaries to spread the Gospel message to new areas or peoples who have not yet heard it.

2. Prophets (Ephesians 4:11; Acts 13:1): They are given a gift of prophecy, enabling them to communicate God's message to His people. They help interpret the will and purposes of God in specific situations or for the church as a whole.

3. Evangelists (Ephesians 4:11; Acts 21:8): Their role is primarily to proclaim the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ, both individually and corporately, among people who have not yet heard it.

4. Pastors/Shepherds (Ephesians 4:11; 1 Timothy 3:1-7): They are responsible for overseeing and caring for the spiritual well-being of the congregation or flock under their care. This includes teaching, preaching, prayer, visiting the sick, counseling, and administering sacraments (like baptism and communion).

5. Teachers (Ephesians 4:11; James 3:1): They help explain and teach God's Word to believers so that they may grow in their faith and live a godly life. This can be done through sermons, Sunday school lessons, or discipleship groups.

6. Deacons (Acts 6:1-7; 1 Timothy 3:8-13): Deacons serve the practical needs of the church community, such as caring for the poor, widows, and orphans, and managing the physical resources of the church. They assist the pastors in ministering to the people.

7. Elders (also called overseers or bishops; 1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9): Elders are spiritual leaders in a local church, providing oversight, guidance, and protection for the flock under their care. They must meet specific qualifications outlined in Scripture, such as being above reproach, husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to wine, gentle, uncontentious, free from the love of money, and managing their own household well.

8. Widows (1 Timothy 5:3-16): In the New Testament, widows were often supported by the church community in prayer and practical needs. The role of a widow, then, can be seen as serving God through faithfulness in prayer, living a godly life, and ministering to others in need.

9. Helpers/Servants (Mark 9:35; Matthew 20:26): All Christians are called to serve one another humbly, just as Jesus came not to be served but to serve and give His life as a ransom for many (Mark 10:45). This can manifest in various ways, depending on individual gifts, talents, and circumstances.

In summary, the Bible encourages Christians to use their unique gifts and talents to serve God within the context of the church community, in roles such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers, deacons, elders, widows, helpers/servants, or any other ministry that glorifies Him.
