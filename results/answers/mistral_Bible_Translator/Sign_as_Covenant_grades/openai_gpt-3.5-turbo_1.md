# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Genesis 9:12-17, we find the story where God establishes His covenant with Noah and all creation after the great flood. This covenant is symbolized by the rainbow:

"I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the cloud, I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth." (Genesis 9:13-16)

The rainbow serves as a reminder of God's promise that He will never again destroy the Earth with a flood as long as there is life remaining. It represents God's faithfulness and His love for His creation, and it is a sign that gives hope and assurance to humanity.
