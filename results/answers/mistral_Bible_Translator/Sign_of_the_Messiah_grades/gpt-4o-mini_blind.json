The student effectively explores multiple theological layers, highlighting Jesus' dual nature as fully divine and fully human, His humble origins, and the inclusive nature of His salvation. The integration of relevant biblical references enriches the explanation and demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian theology. Great job overall!"
