It correctly emphasizes the all-powerful nature of God and the reverence ancient Hebrews felt towards Him. The answer effectively links the use of 'Shaddai' as a title to fostering a deeper relationship with God and approaching the Scriptures with humility and awe. To improve, the response could have further explored the specific instances in the Bible where 'Shaddai' is used and delved into how its meaning impacts those contexts. Additionally, tying in New Testament implications or linking 'Shaddai' to other names of God could enhance the depth of the analysis."
