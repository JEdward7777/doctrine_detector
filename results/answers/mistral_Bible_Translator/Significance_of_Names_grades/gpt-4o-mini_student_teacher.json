  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and insightful response that delves into the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name, connecting it to aspects of God's character and the reverence towards Him in biblical contexts. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith as specified. Additionally, the response could have further emphasized the contrast between using 'Shaddai' as a title versus a name in relation to fostering a personal relationship with God."
