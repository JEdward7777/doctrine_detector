  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response accurately summarizes the significance of translating \"Shaddai\" as a title, highlighting its emphasis on God's attributes, particularly His omnipotence and strength. It also touches on the idea that using it as a name can convey a personal relationship with God. The connection to biblical theology and Christian faith is well-made, demonstrating an understanding of God's character and relational aspect in Scripture.\n\nThe only areas for improvement would be to more explicitly connect the concept of \"Shaddai\" as a title to the concern about deepening our understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. Additionally, while the response provides some insightful observations, it could benefit from more nuance and development in exploring this topic.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of biblical theology and its relevance to Christian faith, making it a solid effort that warrants an 85 grade."
