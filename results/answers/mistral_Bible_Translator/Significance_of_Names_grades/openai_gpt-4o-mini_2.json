The connection between the translation choice and deepening understanding of God's attributes is well-developed and aligns with Christian theological principles. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the personal relationship aspect with God that using 'Shaddai' as a name signifies, in relation to Christian faith."
