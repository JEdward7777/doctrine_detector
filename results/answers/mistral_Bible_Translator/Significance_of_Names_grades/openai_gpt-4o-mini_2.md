## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name lies in understanding its meaning and its role in biblical theology. In Hebrew, 'Shaddai' (שַׁדַּי) is an epithet used to describe God. It appears over 50 times in the Old Testament. The root of the word, shadad (שָׁדַד), means "to overwhelm" or "destroy."

Translating 'Shaddai' as a title instead of a name emphasizes that it is not simply one of many names for God but rather a title indicating specific aspects of His character. This title underscores God's all-powerful, almighty nature. The use of titles like 'Shaddai' (Almighty) and 'El Elyon' (Most High God) in biblical contexts helps to communicate the awe and reverence the ancient Hebrews felt towards their Creator.

In modern Christian Bible translations, using 'Shaddai' as a title rather than a name allows for deeper reflection on God's attributes of power, protection, and providence. This emphasis on God's character can foster a closer relationship with Him and help readers to approach the Scriptures with greater humility and awe.

Ultimately, studying 'Shaddai' as a title deepens our understanding of who God is and how He interacts with His creation—a crucial aspect of Christian theology that encourages faithfulness, obedience, and worship.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of translating 'Shaddai' as a title, emphasizing the aspects of God's character and relational aspect in Christian faith as highlighted in the answer. The connection between the translation choice and deepening understanding of God's attributes is well-developed and aligns with Christian theological principles. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to further emphasize the personal relationship aspect with God that using 'Shaddai' as a name signifies, in relation to Christian faith.
