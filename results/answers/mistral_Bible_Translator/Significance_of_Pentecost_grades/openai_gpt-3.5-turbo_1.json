It beautifully addresses the concern of understanding the role of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers in a clear and insightful manner. The inclusion of key points such as the universal reach of the Gospel, the formation of the church, and the fulfillment of prophecy further enriches the response. Great job in connecting the importance of Pentecost to the believer's relationship with the Holy Spirit."
