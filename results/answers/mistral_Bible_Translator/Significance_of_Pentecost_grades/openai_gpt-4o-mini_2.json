It effectively addresses the concern regarding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers by highlighting how the Holy Spirit empowered the disciples for ministry and fulfilled Jesus' promise. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview and effectively connects the significance of Pentecost to central Christian teachings. Great job!"
