  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 95. The student effectively explains the symbolism of unleavened bread in relation to sin and living a life that honors God, connecting it to the Passover celebration and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the spiritual significance of unleavened bread in Christian teachings and effectively incorporates relevant Bible verses to support their explanation. The only slight deduction could be that the student's explanation was slightly more elaborate than the reference answer, but overall, the response demonstrates a deep understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
