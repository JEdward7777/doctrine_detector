## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The title "Tetrarch" reveals that during the time of Jesus, there was a form of regional government in place within the Roman Empire. A Tetrarch was a Greek term meaning "ruler of a fourth part," and it referred to a governor who ruled over one of the four quarters or provinces of a larger region. This system of tetrarchies existed primarily in territories that are now modern-day Israel, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.

In Jewish history, Herod Antipas was one of the most notable Tetrarchs who ruled over Galilee and Perea during Jesus' ministry. It is important to note that these tetrarchs were appointed by the Roman Empire, and they had significant authority within their respective territories but ultimately answered to the Roman government.

This governance structure highlights the political context in which Jesus lived, as He ministered to the people under the dual rulership of the Roman Empire and various Jewish leaders like Herod Antipas.
