  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the title \"Tetrarch\" and its significance during the time of Jesus. They have effectively highlighted the role of Tetrarchs within the Roman Empire's governance structure and how this impacted the political context in which Jesus ministered. The student could further strengthen their answer by connecting the significance of the tetrarchy system to the specific political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry, as outlined in the concern provided."
