It effectively connects the term to the governance structure under the Roman Empire and highlights the division of power and local rule in Judea. The explanation aligns well with the concern of helping believers understand the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry from a Christian worldview. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic with relevant insights for believers."
