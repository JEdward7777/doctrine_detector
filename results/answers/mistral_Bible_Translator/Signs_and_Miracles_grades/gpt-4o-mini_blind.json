The inclusion of relevant biblical references enhances the explanation and demonstrates a good understanding of Christian theology. The response could be improved by further elaborating on the distinction between signs and miracles and how they specifically serve different purposes in confirming God's message. Additionally, a clearer connection could be made to the overarching theological principle of faith being the ultimate foundation for belief in God's truth."
