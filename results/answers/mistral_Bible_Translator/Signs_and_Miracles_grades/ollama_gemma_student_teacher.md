## [Answer](../Signs_and_Miracles.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, signs and miracles are considered as divine affirmations or confirmations of God's message. They serve to authenticate the identity, mission, and authority of Jesus Christ, as well as the proclamation of the Gospel by the Apostles.

In the New Testament, the signs and miracles performed by Jesus and the apostles are portrayed as demonstrations of God's power and love (John 20:30-31). These miraculous events were meant to reveal God's kingdom, bring healing to people, and confirm the truth of the message that Jesus and His followers were proclaiming.

In the book of John, it is stated that Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not recorded in the Bible, but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing, you may have life in His name (John 20:30-31).

Miracles also played a significant role in validating the Apostles' message after Jesus' ascension. For example, Acts 2:43 tells us that great marvels and signs were taking place by the hands of the Apostles. The miraculous works of the apostles were meant to verify their authority as witnesses to Jesus' life, teachings, death, and resurrection, and to prove that they spoke with divine inspiration.

In summary, signs and miracles in Christian theology function as evidential confirmations of God's truth, demonstrating the power, love, and authenticity of Jesus Christ and His message, as well as validating the authority of the Apostles as witnesses to that truth.
