# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christianity, the term "Son of God" is a significant title given to Jesus Christ that reflects His unique and special relationship with God the Father. This title is rooted in both Old and New Testament scriptures.

In the Old Testament, the term "Son of God" was used for various individuals who held positions of great favor or anointing by God, such as King David (2 Samuel 7:14) and Solomon (1 Chronicles 28:6). However, Jesus is the one in whom this title takes on a deeper and more profound meaning.

In the New Testament, the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke all record the announcement by the angel Gabriel to Mary that her son would be called "the Son of the Most High" (Luke 1:32), and John's Gospel refers to Jesus as "only begotten Son" (John 3:16, 18). These titles emphasize Jesus' unique and eternal relationship with God the Father.

In the context of Christian theology, the title "Son of God" signifies that Jesus is not merely a created being, but rather He is consubstantial (of one being) with the Father as the Second Person of the Holy Trinity. This means that Jesus is fully divine and fully human, united in one person. As such, He is able to reconcile humanity to God through His life, death, and resurrection.

In summary, the term "Son of God" signifies that Jesus Christ is the unique and eternal Son of God the Father, who became a human being for our salvation, in accordance with biblical teaching and Christian theological truth.
