  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This answer provides a solid explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" as it refers to Jesus and the term \"sons (and daughters) of God\" used for believers. The student effectively highlights the unique and divine nature of Jesus as the only begotten Son of God, born of a virgin, and shares the same divine nature as God the Father. Additionally, the student accurately explains how believers become children of God through faith in Jesus Christ, emphasizing the spiritual adoption and heirship into God's family. There is a clear adherence to Christian theology and doctrine in this response. Great job!"
