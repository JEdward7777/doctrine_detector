  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85. \n\nThe student accurately explains the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" and the phrase \"sons (and daughters) of God\" in Christianity, highlighting the unique relationship Jesus has as God's only begotten Son compared to believers who are adopted into God's family. The student also correctly points out the emphasis on Jesus' divinity in contrast to believers' spiritual relationship through faith.\n\nHowever, the student could improve their answer by providing more concise definitions of the distinctions and focusing on the core theological differences between the two terms. Additionally, the student could have included more references to scriptural support for their assertions to strengthen their argument further."
