  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 95\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the theological distinctions between the title \"Son of God\" and the phrase \"sons of God\" within a Christian worldview. The explanation clearly articulates the unique relationship of Jesus as the Son of God, born of the virgin Mary and sharing the divine nature of the Father, while differentiating it from the spiritual relationship of believers as children of God through faith. The student's response is well-written and concise, providing a clear and informative explanation of the theological concepts."
