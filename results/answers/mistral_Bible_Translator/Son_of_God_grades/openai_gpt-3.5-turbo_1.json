  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provided a detailed explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" for Jesus and the phrase \"sons (and daughters) of God\" for believers in Christ. The explanation aligned well with Christian theology and effectively addressed the concern of avoiding confusion in theological discussions. The only room for improvement could be providing more Scripture references to support the explanations given."
