  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and thorough explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" as unique to Jesus Christ and the phrase \"sons (and daughters) of God\" referring to believers in Christ. The response effectively addresses the concern by clearly articulating the distinction, which helps prevent confusion in theological discussions. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian worldview on the topic."
