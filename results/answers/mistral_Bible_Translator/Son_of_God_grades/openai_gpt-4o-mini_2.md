## Question [Son of God](../../../questions/Son_of_God.md)
What distinguishes the title 'Son of God' as it refers to Jesus from the term 'sons of God' used for believers?

The title 'Son of God' specifically pertains to Jesus as God's only Son, while 'sons of God' refers broadly to all believers in Christ.

## Stated Concern
Clarity on this distinction helps avoid confusion in theological discussions.

## [Answer](../Son_of_God.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christianity, the title "Son of God" and the phrase "sons (and daughters) of God" each hold significant meaning but refer to different relationships.

1. The Son of God: This title is unique to Jesus Christ in Christian theology. It signifies that Jesus is God's only begotten Son, born of a virgin, and that He shares the same divine nature as God the Father. In the New Testament, this title emphasizes Jesus' divinity and His role as Messiah and Savior.

2. Sons (and daughters) of God: This phrase is used in both Old and New Testaments to describe those who are redeemed by God or those who follow Him faithfully. It signifies a spiritual relationship where believers become children of God through faith in Jesus Christ. The emphasis here is on our adoption into God's family, the church, and our identity as heirs of His promises.

While both titles reflect special relationships between God and humanity, the distinction lies in the unique, eternal, and divine nature of Jesus as the Son of God, setting Him apart from believers who are adopted as children of God through faith.
