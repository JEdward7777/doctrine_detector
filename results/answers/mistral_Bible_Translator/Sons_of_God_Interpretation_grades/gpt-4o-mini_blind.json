  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in the context of Genesis 6. They accurately presented various viewpoints held within Christian scholarship and denominations. However, the student could have emphasized that the angelic beings interpretation contradicts the nature of angels as non-procreating beings according to Matthew 22:30 more assertively. Additionally, a more explicit connection to a Christian doctrinal stance could have strengthened the analysis of each interpretation. Overall, a solid exploration of the topic, but lacking a clear affirmation of a doctrinally sound interpretation."
