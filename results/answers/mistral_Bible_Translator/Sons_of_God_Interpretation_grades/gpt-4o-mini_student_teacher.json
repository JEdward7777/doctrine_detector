  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of various interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, while they explored different perspectives and backed them up with biblical references and reasoning, the reference answer from the teacher provided a more concise and focused perspective. The student could improve by presenting a clearer thesis statement at the beginning to guide the discussion and by aligning the interpretations discussed more closely with the reference answer. Nonetheless, the student showed a solid grasp of biblical interpretation and engaged thoughtfully with the question."
