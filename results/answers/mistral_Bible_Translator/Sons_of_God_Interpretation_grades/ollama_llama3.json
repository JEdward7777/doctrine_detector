  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe student's answer accurately reflects that there are different interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6, including fallen angels, powerful political rulers, or descendants of Seth. This demonstrates an understanding of the complexity and diversity of biblical interpretation.\n\nThe concern is also well-addressed, as the response explains that various interpretations have strengths and weaknesses, and that careful exegesis and prayerful discernment are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of scripture passages.\n\nHowever, I would deduct points because the response does not provide a clear and concise answer. The original answer only mentions three possible interpretations without providing further clarification or support from biblical texts. A more detailed and nuanced response would be expected for a score closer to 100.\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of biblical interpretation and its importance in grasping the meaning of scripture passages. However, the response could be improved by providing more specific examples and scriptural support for each interpretation, as well as highlighting any potential weaknesses or limitations in each view."
