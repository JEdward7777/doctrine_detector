  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of various interpretations of the term \"sons of God\" in the context of Genesis 6, demonstrating an understanding of biblical interpretation and its importance in grasping the meaning of Scripture passages. The inclusion of different perspectives and the discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each interpretation show a thoughtful analysis of the topic. However, the response could have been improved by providing more explicit references to specific biblical passages supporting each interpretation."
