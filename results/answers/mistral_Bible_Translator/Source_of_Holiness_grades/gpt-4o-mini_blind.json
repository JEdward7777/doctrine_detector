The inclusion of relevant biblical references adds support to the explanation. However, there are a few areas that could be further elaborated on, such as the importance of sanctification in the process of becoming a saint and the distinction between the universal priesthood of believers and the special recognition of certain individuals as saints. Overall, a solid response but could benefit from additional depth and clarity."
