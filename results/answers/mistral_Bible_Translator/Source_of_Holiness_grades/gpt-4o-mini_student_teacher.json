  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing the different meanings of \"saint\" in Christianity and the process of recognizing saints in the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions. However, the student did not clearly emphasize the central role of faith in Jesus as the source of holiness, as highlighted in the concern. The student's explanation could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the process of becoming a saint to faith in Jesus Christ, as indicated in the reference answer."
