## [Answer](../Source_of_Holiness.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christianity, the term "saint" has two distinct meanings. In a general sense, anyone who believes in Jesus Christ as their Savior and follows Him is considered a saint by virtue of their faith. This concept is based on the teachings of Paul in the New Testament, where he refers to all believers as saints (e.g., 1 Corinthians 1:2).

In a more specific sense, sainthood refers to individuals who have been formally recognized by the Church as models of Christian living and intercessors before God. The Catholic Church has a process for recognizing saints, which includes verification of their virtuous lives, heroic acts of faith, and miracles attributed to their intercession after death. This concept is based on the teachings found in the New Testament (e.g., Matthew 10:32-33, Revelation 13:7).

Eastern Orthodox Christianity has a similar but slightly different process for recognizing saints. In both traditions, sainthood is not something that an individual achieves through personal effort, but rather it is the recognition of God and the Church for lives lived in accordance with God's will.
