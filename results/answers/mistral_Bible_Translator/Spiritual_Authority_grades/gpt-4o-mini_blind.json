  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough comparison between spiritual authorities and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. It correctly highlights key differences such as the source of authority, purpose, legitimacy, accountability, and relationship with followers. The references to relevant Bible verses support the explanation well. However, the response could have further emphasized the importance of spiritual authorities aligning with and upholding the teachings of Scripture as their ultimate guide. Additionally, more emphasis on the spiritual authority's role in equipping believers for ministry and service could enhance the answer's depth. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic is demonstrated."
