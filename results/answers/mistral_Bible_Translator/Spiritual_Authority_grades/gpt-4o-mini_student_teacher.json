  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer highlighting key differences between spiritual and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. The response also referenced relevant Bible verses to support the points made. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern raised regarding the implications of recognizing these distinctions in a Christian's life. Further elaboration on how understanding these differences impacts a Christian's behavior, decision-making, and relationship with authority would have strengthened the response."
