# Question [Spiritual Authority](../../../questions/Spiritual_Authority.md)
How do spiritual authorities differ from earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching?

Spiritual authorities, mentioned in Ephesians 6:12, are entities that exert power over those who do not submit to God's authority, differing from earthly authorities which have rule over physical governance.

# Stated Concern
Recognizing the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority and their implications in a Christian's life

# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Biblical teaching, spiritual authorities and earthly authorities have distinct roles, purposes, and sources of legitimacy. Here are some key differences:

1. Source of Authority: Earthly authority comes from human institutions such as governments or organizations (Romans 13:1). Spiritual authority, on the other hand, originates from God and is exercised by spiritual leaders, like pastors, teachers, and apostles (Hebrews 13:7, 24; Ephesians 4:11).

2. Purpose: Earthly authorities are established to maintain order, protect citizens, and enforce laws for the common good (Romans 13:3-4). Spiritual authorities guide, teach, and shepherd God's people in spiritual matters, helping them grow in their faith (1 Peter 5:2-3).

3. Legitimacy: Earthly authorities derive their authority from the consent of the governed (Romans 13:2) or from the divine appointment of rulers by God (Daniel 2:21). Spiritual authorities are recognized and followed because they teach sound doctrine, lead a blameless life, and have a godly character (1 Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9).

4. Accountability: Earthly authorities will be judged by God for their actions (2 Samuel 12:1-15; Romans 13:4). Spiritual authorities are accountable to God and to the congregation for their leadership and teaching (James 3:1). In addition, spiritual authorities are encouraged to seek the counsel of other trusted leaders in times of difficulty or uncertainty (Acts 15:2-6).

5. Relationship with followers: Earthly authorities have a more distant relationship with their subjects, enforcing rules and laws. Spiritual authorities aim to build relationships with their followers through prayer, encouragement, teaching, and pastoral care (Galatians 6:1; Hebrews 13:17).

In summary, earthly authorities are concerned with the temporal realm and maintain order, while spiritual authorities focus on the spiritual welfare of believers. Both types of authority ultimately answer to God for their actions and decisions.
