  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid understanding of the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities based on Biblical teachings, highlighting their sources of authority, purposes, legitimacy, accountability, and relationships with followers. It effectively addresses the concern by clearly explaining how spiritual authorities differ from earthly authorities in relation to exerting power over those who do not submit to God's authority. The response could be enhanced by incorporating additional scriptural references to support the points made and by offering a more in-depth analysis or application of the distinction between spiritual and worldly authority in a Christian's life."
