  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the role demons play in deceiving individuals towards idolatry, referencing relevant Bible passages. They accurately convey the Christian perspective on this issue and demonstrate understanding of the spiritual deceit Christians should be aware of. The only improvement would be to directly state that demons deceive people into believing in false gods and idols, aligning more closely with the reference answer. Overall, a strong response with solid references to Christian beliefs."
