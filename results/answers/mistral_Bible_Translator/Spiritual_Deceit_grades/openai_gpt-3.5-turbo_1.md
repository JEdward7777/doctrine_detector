## [Answer](../Spiritual_Deceit.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Christian theology as depicted in the Old and New Testaments, demons or evil spirits are believed to influence and facilitate human actions towards idolatry, a practice considered contrary to God's will. The concept is detailed extensively in several passages throughout the Bible.

For example, Deuteronomy 32:17 states that Israel worshiped idols made of metal, "the work of human hands," which were "the work of skillful men" â€” but the ones who did this were not the idol-makers themselves, but rather the demons behind them.

Similarly, in 1 Corinthians 10:20-21, Paul warns the Corinthian church against participating in pagan rituals related to idols, noting that "they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons."

These passages suggest that demons play a role in the deception of idolatry by influencing human actions towards false worship and leading people astray from the true God. However, it is important to remember that this is a religious belief and not universally accepted as fact outside of Christian theology.
