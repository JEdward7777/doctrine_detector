## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The phrase "spiritual gifts" as described in the Bible refers to extraordinary abilities given by the Holy Spirit to believers for the building up and edification of the church (1 Corinthians 12:7). These gifts are distributed as the Spirit wills, and each member of the body of Christ receives at least one gift for the common good (verse 11).

   The spiritual gifts serve various purposes, such as leadership, service, teaching, healing, and prophecy. Some examples of these gifts include wisdom, faith, knowledge, healing, tongues, and interpretation of tongues (verses 8-10). It's important to note that not all the gifts mentioned in the Bible are operative today or for every believer, as their manifestations were significant during the early days of the church.

   The presence of these spiritual gifts signifies a connection between believers and the Holy Spirit, and they should be exercised with humility, diligence, and discretion (1 Corinthians 12:4-6, 13:1-7; Ephesians 4:11-13). Their function is to edify the church and bring glory to God, rather than personal recognition or self-promotion.

   In summary, spiritual gifts highlight the unity of believers in Christ, each with unique roles to play within the body, for the greater good and worship of God. They serve as tangible evidence of the indwelling presence and guidance of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers.
