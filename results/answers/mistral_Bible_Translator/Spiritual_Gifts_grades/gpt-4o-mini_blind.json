  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the concept of spiritual gifts as described in the Bible. The student accurately outlines the purpose and distribution of spiritual gifts, as well as the importance of exercising them with humility and for the edification of the church. The mention of not all gifts being operative today for every believer showcases an understanding of the nuances within this topic. The response could have been strengthened by including scriptural references for each point discussed and delving deeper into the role of spiritual gifts in the contemporary church context."
