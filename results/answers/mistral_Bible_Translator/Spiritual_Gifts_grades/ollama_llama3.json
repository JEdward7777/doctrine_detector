  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of recognizing the importance of spiritual gifts in building up the church and serving others, which aligns well with the concern about utilizing these gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. The response also provides some biblical support for its claims, citing specific passages from 1 Corinthians.\n\nThe only areas for improvement are that the response could delve deeper into the biblical texts and provide more examples of spiritual gifts. Additionally, while the response mentions the importance of exercising these gifts with humility, diligence, and discretion, it could expand on what this looks like in practical terms.\n\nOverall, however, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides a solid foundation for understanding the role of spiritual gifts in the life of the believer."
