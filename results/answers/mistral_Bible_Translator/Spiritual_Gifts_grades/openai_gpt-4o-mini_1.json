It effectively addresses the concern by stressing the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit. The integration of biblical references and the emphasis on humility, diligence, and glorifying God in the exercise of spiritual gifts further strengthen the Christian perspective."
