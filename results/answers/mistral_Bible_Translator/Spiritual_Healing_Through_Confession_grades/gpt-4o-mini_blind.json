  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-rounded explanation of how confessing sins to one another contributes to spiritual healing, referencing key aspects such as accountability, prayer, forgiveness, restoration, and transformation. The answer effectively connects these concepts to biblical principles and presents a holistic view of the impact of confession within the Christian context. The response could be strengthened by incorporating more direct references to scriptural support throughout the explanation. Overall, a solid and doctrinally sound response."
