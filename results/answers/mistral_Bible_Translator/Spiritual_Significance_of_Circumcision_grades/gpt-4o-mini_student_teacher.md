## [Answer](../Spiritual_Significance_of_Circumcision.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a Christian context, the phrase "circumcision of the heart" symbolizes spiritual purity and obedience. It is often referenced in the New Testament as an allusion to Old Testament passages about circumcising the flesh (physical circumcision) of male Israelites. However, Jesus and the Apostle Paul emphasized that true circumcision comes from within, not through physical rites.

In the New Testament, Romans 2:29 says, "Circumcision means circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code." This passage indicates that a person's spiritual condition (a pure and humble heart) is more important than outward rituals.

Therefore, in a Christian context, the "circumcision of the heart" represents the renewal of one's inner being through faith in Jesus Christ, resulting in a transformed life that follows God's commands from the heart (not just outwardly).
