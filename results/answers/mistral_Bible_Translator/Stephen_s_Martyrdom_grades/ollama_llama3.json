  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and detailed account of the stoning of Stephen, highlighting its significance in the early Christian church and its implications for the spread of Christianity. It also explores the themes of persecution, faithfulness, and commitment to one's beliefs, which align with the concern about the cost of discipleship and faithfulness in the face of persecution.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of connecting Stephen's stoning to the broader context of early Christian history and theology, including the spread of Christianity beyond Jerusalem. The author also effectively uses biblical references (Acts 6:5, Acts 7:2-53, Acts 8:1-4) to support their claims.\n\nOne area for improvement could be to more explicitly connect Stephen's martyrdom to the broader theme of discipleship and faithfulness in the face of persecution. While the response touches on this theme, it could be further developed and emphasized throughout the text.\n\nComment: This is a strong response that effectively explores the significance of Stephen's stoning and its implications for early Christian history. With some additional attention to explicitly connecting the martyrdom to the concern about discipleship and faithfulness, this response could be even stronger."
