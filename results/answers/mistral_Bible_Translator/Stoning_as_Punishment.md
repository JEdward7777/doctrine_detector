## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery is mentioned in several passages in the Old Testament (Leviticus 20:10, Deuteronomy 22:22, and John 8:5). However, it is important to understand that the Mosaic Law, which includes these instructions about stoning, was given to the Israelites as part of their cultural and legal system during a specific historical context.

In the New Testament, Jesus himself, in the account found in John 8:3-11, interprets the law of Moses regarding adultery in a way that highlights God's mercy and love. When the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery before him for judgment according to the Law, Jesus chose not to stone her but instead said, "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her." (John 8:7) By doing this, Jesus not only demonstrated his compassion and mercy towards the woman but also indirectly showed that the Law was meant to reveal the need for God's grace and forgiveness rather than serving as a tool for condemnation.

It is also crucial to note that the early Christian church did not practice stoning as a form of punishment, as seen in the New Testament writings (e.g., Romans 13:8-10). Instead, the focus shifted towards repentance and forgiveness.

In summary, the Bible does mention stoning as a punishment for adultery in the Old Testament but teaches mercy, compassion, and grace through the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. The New Testament highlights God's justice and mercy by emphasizing forgiveness and love, rather than punishment.
