  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough and well-explained understanding of the practice of stoning for adultery in the Bible, acknowledging the historical context and the shift in emphasis towards mercy and forgiveness in the New Testament. The student effectively balances the concepts of God's justice and mercy in relation to this topic. The answer could have been strengthened by directly referencing the commandments in the Old Testament where stoning for adultery is mandated and by explicitly connecting God's justice and mercy in the interpretations provided. Overall, a strong and insightful response."
