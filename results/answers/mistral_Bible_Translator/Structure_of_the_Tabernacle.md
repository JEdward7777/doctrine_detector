## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Tabernacle described in the Old Testament (Exodus chapters 25-40), there were two main sections: the Holy Place (Hebrew: Hekhal HaKodesh) and the Most Holy Place (Hebrew: Debir HaKodesh).

1. The Holy Place (Hekhal HaKodesh): This was the first room people would enter when approaching the Tabernacle, located just beyond the courtyard. In this area were three main items:
   - The golden altar of incense, which was used for prayers and offerings.
   - The seven-branched menorah (candlestick), representing the light of God. The menorah had seven branches, with only six branches bearing oil cups; the seventh branch held a flame to light the others.
   - The table of showbread, containing twelve loaves of bread placed on it, which represented God's provision for his people and His covenant relationship with them.

2. The Most Holy Place (Debir HaKodesh): This was the inner sanctum of the Tabernacle, entered only once a year by the High Priest during the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). Inside were:
   - The Ark of the Covenant, containing the tablets of the Ten Commandments, a pot of manna, and Aaron's staff that budded. The Ark symbolized God's presence among his people and represented the covenant relationship between God and Israel.
   - The Mercy Seat (Kapporeth), which was the lid of the Ark. It was covered with pure gold and was sprinkled with the blood of the sacrifices on the Day of Atonement, symbolizing forgiveness and atonement for the sins of the people.
