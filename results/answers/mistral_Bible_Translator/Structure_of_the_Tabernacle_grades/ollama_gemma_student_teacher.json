  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the two main sections of the tabernacle and their associated significance. They accurately identify the items located in each section and provide relevant details about their symbolic meaning within the context of worship. While the answer lacks some elaboration on the broader significance of the tabernacle as a representation of God's presence and covenant relationship with his people, it effectively addresses the given concern related to the importance of its components in worship."
