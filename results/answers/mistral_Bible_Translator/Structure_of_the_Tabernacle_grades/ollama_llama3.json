  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response accurately identifies the two main sections of the Tabernacle (Holy Place and Most Holy Place) and mentions some key items found within, it does not delve into the deeper significance or symbolism of these components in worship. The answer provided is quite superficial and lacks any meaningful insight into how the Tabernacle's design and contents were meant to facilitate a meaningful relationship with God.\n\nTo improve this response, I would encourage the student to explore the biblical texts more thoroughly and to consider the ways in which the Tabernacle's architecture and furnishings pointed to Jesus Christ, the ultimate High Priest and Mediator between God and humanity."
