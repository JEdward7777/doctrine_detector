 The metaphor of the cornerstone, as used in the Bible, particularly in Psalm 118:22 and Ephesians 2:20, powerfully illustrates the relationship between Jesus Christ and His followers. In ancient construction, a cornerstone was the first stone laid for a building, crucial to the structure's stability and alignment. Here are some ways this metaphor relates to Jesus and His followers:

1. Foundation Stone (Ephesians 2:20): Jesus is likened to the cornerstone, upon which the Church is built. He is the foundation of our faith, providing a solid structure for Christian living and spiritual growth. The Church, as His followers, are built together on this foundation.

2. Key Stone (Matthew 21:42): Just as a key stone at the top of an arch locks all other stones into place, Jesus is the one who holds everything together in our lives, helping us to live according to God's will and keeping us aligned with His plan for us.

3. Rejected Stone (Psalm 118:22): Initially, Jesus was rejected by many. However, He became the chosen and precious cornerstone when He was accepted by those who put their faith in Him. In the same way, the world may reject Christians, but they find acceptance and belonging within the Christian community.

4. Corner of Salvation (Isaiah 8:16): Jesus is not only a cornerstone but also the corner from which salvation comes. By accepting Him, we can experience God's grace, forgiveness, and the hope that He offers us for this life and the next.

5. Perfect Fit (Ephesians 4:13): As individual believers grow in their faith and understanding of Jesus, they come to fit perfectly into the body of Christ - the Church. They become living stones, each with a unique role, but all united in Him as the cornerstone.

6. Source of Strength (Matthew 16:18): Jesus promised that He would be the foundation and source of strength for His followers. Just as a cornerstone provides support for the entire building, Jesus strengthens believers as they face trials and challenges in life.

7. Gateway to God (Psalm 118:20): Jesus serves as the gateway through which we can approach God. He bridged the gap between humanity and God, making it possible for us to have a personal relationship with our Creator.
