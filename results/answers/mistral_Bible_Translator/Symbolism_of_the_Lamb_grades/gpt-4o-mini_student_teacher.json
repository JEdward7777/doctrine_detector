They have effectively connected the symbolism of the lamb as representing innocence and purity to the idea of atonement as the sacrifice of the innocent for the guilty. The student has drawn on relevant biblical examples and demonstrated a clear understanding of how the sacrificial system in the Old Testament foreshadowed the ultimate atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God in the New Testament. The answer is well-supported, insightful, and aligns closely with the Christian worldview. Great job overall."
