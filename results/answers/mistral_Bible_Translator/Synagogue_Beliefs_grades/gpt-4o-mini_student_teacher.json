The student correctly identifies the communal aspect of gathering in worship as indicated by the term 'synagogue.' The answer effectively explains how the term can extend beyond just the physical building to encompass the Jewish community or congregation. However, the student could have further emphasized the figurative aspect of the term 'synagogue' in relation to the group of people who meet for worship, as per the reference answer provided by the teacher."
