## Correct Answer

## Stated Concern
Understanding the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship as indicated by the term 'synagogue'.

## [Answer](../Synagogue_Beliefs.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of Christianity and Judaism, the term "Synagogue" can be understood in two main ways:

1. The Physical Building: This is the most literal sense, referring to the Jewish house of worship where the Torah is read, prayers are said, and the Jewish community gathers for religious services. In the New Testament, several events related to Jesus and early Christianity took place within synagogues.

2. The Jewish Community or Congregation: This is a more metaphorical sense, referring to the Jewish people as a whole, or a specific group of Jews gathered together for religious or communal purposes. For example, in John 10:16, Jesus refers to "other sheep" who are not part of His immediate followers but belong to the same flock, implying they are part of the Jewish community or synagogue (in this broader sense).

In both senses, the term 'synagogue' carries significant religious and cultural connotations.
