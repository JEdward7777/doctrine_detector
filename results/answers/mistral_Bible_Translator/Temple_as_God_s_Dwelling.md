## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, the temple was considered a physical structure where God's presence dwelled among His people (Exodus 25:8). The temple was first built under King Solomon, who reigned in ancient Israel around 960-931 BC. The Holy of Holies within the temple was believed to be the place where God's glory resided (1 Kings 8:10-11).

However, the concept of God's dwelling evolves in the New Testament as it emphasizes that God no longer dwells in a physical structure but among His people. Jesus Christ, as the Son of God, is seen as the new temple (John 2:19-21), and believers who follow Him become the spiritual temples where the Holy Spirit resides (1 Corinthians 3:16-17; 6:19). This symbolizes that all Christians can experience a personal, intimate relationship with God, rather than relying on a physical temple as a means of accessing His presence.

This transformation from a physical temple to people as the new temples highlights the shift from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant in Christianity and underscores the importance of faith and personal relationship with God through Christ.
