  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of the concept of the temple as God's dwelling in both the Old and New Testaments. They correctly highlight the transition from the physical temple in the Old Testament to believers as temples in the New Testament through Jesus Christ. The explanation is well-supported by relevant biblical references and effectively communicates the doctrinal evolution of God's dwelling place. Great job overall."
