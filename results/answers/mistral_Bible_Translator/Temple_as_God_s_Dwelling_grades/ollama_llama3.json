However, the response could be strengthened by providing more specific biblical examples and explanations of this concept, particularly with regards to Jesus Christ being referred to as the new temple (John 2:19-21). Additionally, a deeper exploration of what this means for Christian living and worship would further enhance the understanding of God dwelling among His people."
