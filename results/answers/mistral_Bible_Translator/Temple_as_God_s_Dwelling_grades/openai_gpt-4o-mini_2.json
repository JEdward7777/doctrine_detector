  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively explores the theological implications of God dwelling among His people by tracing the concept of the temple from the Old Testament to the New Testament and discussing the shift from a physical structure to believers being temples of the Holy Spirit. The integration of relevant biblical references and the explanation of the significance of this transformation within the Christian faith are strong points. The response could have further expanded on the implications for Christian living and worship practices to enrich the theological discussion even more."
