## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the biblical account in the book of Matthew (Chapter 4 verses 1-11), when Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil, He responded to each temptation with scripture.

1. The first temptation was to turn stones into bread. Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Matthew 4:4)

2. The second temptation was to jump off the temple and be saved by angels. Jesus said to him, "Again it is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Matthew 4:7)

3. The third temptation was to worship Satan in exchange for the kingdoms of the world. Jesus responded with scripture as well, quoting Deuteronomy 6:13, "Worship the Lord your God and serve him only." (Matthew 4:10)

In each instance, instead of succumbing to temptation or using his divine power for personal gain, Jesus demonstrated His submission to God's will by resisting Satan with scripture. This event in the life of Jesus shows His obedience to God and sets an example for all believers in their struggle against sin and temptation.
