  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 95.\n\nThe student's response accurately summarizes Jesus' resistance to Satan's temptations in the book of Matthew, highlighting His use of Scripture as a means of defense against temptation. The answer also correctly captures the essence of Jesus' behavior, stating that He did not give in to Satan's temptations and instead demonstrated obedience and commitment to God.\n\nThe concern is also well-addressed, as the student notes that understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation provides a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. This connection to the broader Christian experience is an important aspect of biblical interpretation and application.\n\nThe only area where the response could improve is in terms of depth and analysis. While the summary is thorough, it does not delve particularly deeply into the significance or implications of Jesus' resistance to temptation. However, this is a minor criticism, as the response effectively addresses the concern and accurately summarizes the biblical account."
