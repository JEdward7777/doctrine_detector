## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the biblical account in the book of Matthew (Chapter 4 verses 1-11), when Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil, He responded to each temptation with scripture.

1. The first temptation was to turn stones into bread. Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'" (Matthew 4:4)

2. The second temptation was to jump off the temple and be saved by angels. Jesus said to him, "Again it is written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Matthew 4:7)

3. The third temptation was to worship Satan in exchange for the kingdoms of the world. Jesus responded with scripture as well, quoting Deuteronomy 6:13, "Worship the Lord your God and serve him only." (Matthew 4:10)

In each instance, instead of succumbing to temptation or using his divine power for personal gain, Jesus demonstrated His submission to God's will by resisting Satan with scripture. This event in the life of Jesus shows His obedience to God and sets an example for all believers in their struggle against sin and temptation.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would grade this response a 95.

The student's response accurately summarizes Jesus' resistance to Satan's temptations in the book of Matthew, highlighting His use of Scripture as a means of defense against temptation. The answer also correctly captures the essence of Jesus' behavior, stating that He did not give in to Satan's temptations and instead demonstrated obedience and commitment to God.

The concern is also well-addressed, as the student notes that understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation provides a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil. This connection to the broader Christian experience is an important aspect of biblical interpretation and application.

The only area where the response could improve is in terms of depth and analysis. While the summary is thorough, it does not delve particularly deeply into the significance or implications of Jesus' resistance to temptation. However, this is a minor criticism, as the response effectively addresses the concern and accurately summarizes the biblical account.
