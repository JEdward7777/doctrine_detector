  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** While the student's answer provides a comprehensive list of terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, it lacks additional elaboration on the significance or theological underpinnings of these terms within Christian communities. The reference answer provided by the teacher focuses on 'communion' and 'Last Supper', which are notable omissions from the student's response. Including these terms would have enhanced the breadth and depth of the overall answer."
