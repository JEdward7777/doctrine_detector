  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nWhile the original response mentions two common terms used to refer to the Lord's Supper, \"communion\" and \"Last Supper\", it fails to provide any insight or understanding into the various terms used within Christianity to refer to this sacred practice. The provided list in the given answer provides more comprehensive information about the different terms used across Christian denominations, but the concern is not fully addressed.\n\nComment: This response could be improved by providing a brief explanation of why these different terms are used and how they reflect the unique traditions and interpretations within each denomination."
