 In various Christian communities, the Lord's Supper is referred to by several terms that reflect their respective denominational traditions and interpretations of scripture. Here are some common terms:

1. Eucharist (Greek for "thanksgiving") – widely used among Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Anglican, and many Protestant churches.
2. Holy Communion or The Sacrament of the Altar – commonly used in Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopal, and other denominations.
3. The Lord's Table, The Agape Feast, or Breaking of Bread – used by various congregations within non-denominational churches and some Pentecostal communities.
4. Mass – used almost exclusively by the Roman Catholic Church.
5. Divine Liturgy – primarily used in Eastern Orthodox Churches, but may also be found in some Anglican parishes.
6. The Holy Mysteries – within the Oriental Orthodox family (including Coptic Orthodox and Ethiopian Orthodox).

However, it lacks depth in discussing the variety of terms used within Christianity to refer to this sacred practice as outlined in the provided list. A deeper exploration and analysis of the different terms from various Christian traditions would have been beneficial.
