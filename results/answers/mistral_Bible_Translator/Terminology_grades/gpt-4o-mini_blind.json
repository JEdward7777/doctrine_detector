The references to servant leadership, stewardship, and the Greek origin of \"deacon\" are commendable. However, the term \"Officer\" may not align perfectly with the traditional understanding of a deacon as a servant leader rather than a position of authority. Additionally, while \"Minister\" can denote aspects of service, it could potentially cause confusion given its primary association with ordained clergy. Great effort overall with room for minor adjustments for doctrinal clarity."
