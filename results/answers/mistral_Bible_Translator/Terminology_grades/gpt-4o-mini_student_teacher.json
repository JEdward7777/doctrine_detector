  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of alternative terms to describe a deacon, covering various aspects of their service roles within the church. Each term offered by the student aligns well with the concern of recognizing different ways to identify service roles within the church. However, the reference answer from the teacher offers a more succinct and direct response, which is why a slightly lower grade is given. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding and application of Christian principles in identifying alternative terms for a deacon."
