1. Servant Leader: This term emphasizes the role of a deacon as one who serves and leads within the church community.

2. Minister: While typically used for pastors or priests, it can also be used to denote the service aspect of a deacon's role.

3. Steward: This term highlights the responsibility that a deacon has in managing and caring for the resources of the church.

4. Officer: This term emphasizes the position of authority held by a deacon within the church hierarchy.

5. Lay Leader: This term underscores the fact that a deacon is not an ordained minister but a layperson who leads in specific roles within the church.

6. Acolyte: While this term is more commonly used in some denominations, it can be used to describe a deacon's role in serving during worship services.

7. Diakonos (Greek): This is the original Greek word from which "deacon" comes. It simply means servant or attendant.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of alternative terms to describe a deacon, covering various aspects of their service roles within the church. Each term offered by the student aligns well with the concern of recognizing different ways to identify service roles within the church. However, the reference answer from the teacher offers a more succinct and direct response, which is why a slightly lower grade is given. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding and application of Christian principles in identifying alternative terms for a deacon.
