The inclusion of the original Greek word \"diakonos\" adds further depth and demonstrates a broader knowledge of the term's origins. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from including additional terms suggested by the teacher, such as \"church minister\" or \"church worker.\" Additionally, some explanations could be slightly expanded to provide more clarity on the specific connotations of each term."
