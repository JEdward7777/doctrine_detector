2. Minister: While typically used for pastors or priests, it can also be used to denote the service aspect of a deacon's role.

3. Steward: This term highlights the responsibility that a deacon has in managing and caring for the resources of the church.

4. Officer: This term emphasizes the position of authority held by a deacon within the church hierarchy.

5. Lay Leader: This term underscores the fact that a deacon is not an ordained minister but a layperson who leads in specific roles within the church.

6. Acolyte: While this term is more commonly used in some denominations, it can be used to describe a deacon's role in serving during worship services.

7. Diakonos (Greek): This is the original Greek word from which "deacon" comes. It simply means servant or attendant.

**Comments:**

The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the various terms that can be used to describe a deacon within a Christian worldview. The inclusion of the original Greek word "diakonos" adds further depth and demonstrates a broader knowledge of the term's origins. 

However, the answer could benefit from including additional terms suggested by the teacher, such as "church minister" or "church worker." Additionally, some explanations could be slightly expanded to provide more clarity on the specific connotations of each term.
