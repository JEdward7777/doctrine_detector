  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does touch on recognizing various ways to identify service roles within the church, it falls short in providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the different terms used to describe a deacon's role. The original response only mentions three possible titles, whereas the provided options (1-7) offer a more detailed and varied range of descriptions.\n\nTo improve this grade, I would suggest expanding on the various ways to identify service roles within the church, using specific biblical examples or denominational traditions to support the different terms used."
