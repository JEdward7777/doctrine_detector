The response accurately captures the essence of the concern by mentioning terms such as \"servant leader,\" \"minister,\" \"steward,\" \"officer,\" \"lay leader,\" \"acolyte,\" and \"Diakonos (Greek).\" The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a bit more explanation or context for each term to further demonstrate how they relate to the deacon's service role within the church."
