The student accurately identifies common terms like \"church minister,\" \"church worker,\" and \"church servant,\" which align with the concern of recognizing service roles within the church. The inclusion of terms like \"Servant Leader,\" \"Minister,\" and \"Diakonos\" shows a well-rounded knowledge of the terminology associated with service roles in a Christian context. Well done!"
