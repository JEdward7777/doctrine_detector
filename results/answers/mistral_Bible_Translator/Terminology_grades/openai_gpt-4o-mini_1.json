The incorporation of terms such as Servant Leader, Minister, Steward, Officer, Lay Leader, Acolyte, and Diakonos demonstrates a deep knowledge of the subject matter. However, the response could have been enhanced by providing a bit more context or explanation for each term to further illustrate the significance of each title within the church hierarchy."
