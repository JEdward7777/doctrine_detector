1. Servant Leader: This term emphasizes the role of a deacon as one who serves and leads within the church community.

2. Minister: While typically used for pastors or priests, it can also be used to denote the service aspect of a deacon's role.

3. Steward: This term highlights the responsibility that a deacon has in managing and caring for the resources of the church.

4. Officer: This term emphasizes the position of authority held by a deacon within the church hierarchy.

5. Lay Leader: This term underscores the fact that a deacon is not an ordained minister but a layperson who leads in specific roles within the church.

6. Acolyte: While this term is more commonly used in some denominations, it can be used to describe a deacon's role in serving during worship services.

7. Diakonos (Greek): This is the original Greek word from which "deacon" comes. It simply means servant or attendant.
