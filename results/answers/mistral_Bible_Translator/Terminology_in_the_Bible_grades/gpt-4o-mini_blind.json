They have correctly explained the significance of Israelites, Hebrews, and Jews in relation to God's chosen people throughout different periods of history. The answer is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. The only room for improvement could be including more explicit references to biblical passages that support the interchangeability of these terms."
