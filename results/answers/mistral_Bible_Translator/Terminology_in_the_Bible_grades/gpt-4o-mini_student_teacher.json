  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed and accurate explanation of how the terms Israelites, Hebrews, and Jews are often used interchangeably to refer to God's chosen people in the Bible. They show a good understanding of the historical and cultural contexts in which these terms were used, and how they evolved over time. The additional information provided about the distinctions and developments of these terms enhances the answer, although the student could have directly aligned their response more closely with the concise reference answer given by the teacher."
