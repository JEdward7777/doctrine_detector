1. Israelites: These were the original inhabitants of the land of Canaan, descendants of Jacob (later renamed Israel), who became God's chosen people after the Exodus from Egypt.

2. Hebrews: This term is often used interchangeably with Israelites to refer to those who lived in ancient Palestine and were the ancestors of the Jewish people. The term "Hebrew" was initially used to distinguish them from the Canaanites, but over time it became a synonym for the chosen people of God.

3. Jews: The term Jew is often used interchangeably with Israelites or Hebrews in post-Exilic times (after the Babylonian captivity). The word Jewish refers to anyone belonging to the religion and ethnic group native to Palestine who adhere to the religious beliefs centered around Torah, the Talmud, Midrash, and the Zohar.

It is important to note that while these terms are often used interchangeably in casual conversation or reading of the Bible, they do not always refer to the same group throughout history due to factors such as migrations, conquests, and religious shifts.
