  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provided a thorough explanation supported by biblical references from both the Old and New Testaments to explain why it is considered wrong to put God to the test. They correctly highlighted the lack of faith and trust in God's providence as key reasons. However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the aspect of acknowledging God as almighty and holy, as mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, the response could have included a bit more emphasis on the importance of maintaining a proper relationship with God, as indicated in the concern.\n\nOverall, the student showed a good understanding of the concept but could have connected it more closely to the specific concern provided."
