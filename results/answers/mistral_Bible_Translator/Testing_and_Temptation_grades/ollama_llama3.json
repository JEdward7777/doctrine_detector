  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts of testing and temptation, and it provides some clear examples from Scripture to support its points. The distinction between the two is well-explained, and the concern for spiritual discernment is validly addressed.\n\nThe only areas where the response could be improved are in its clarity and depth. Some of the sentences are a bit vague or general, which makes it hard to follow their exact meaning. Additionally, there are no specific examples or illustrations used to further clarify the points being made.\n\nOverall, however, this is a solid response that demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts and addresses the concern in a meaningful way.\n\nComment: While this response has some great insights and clear explanations, it could benefit from more specificity and illustration to make its points even stronger."
