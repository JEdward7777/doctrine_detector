## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, Herod Antipas, often referred to as "Herod the Tetrarch," plays a significant role in two notable stories.

1. John the Baptist and Jesus: Herod Antipas is best known for his involvement in the story of John the Baptist (Matthew 14:1-12, Mark 6:14-29, Luke 3:19-20, Luke 9:7-9). According to these accounts, John publicly criticized Herod Antipas for marrying his brother's wife, Herodias. In retaliation, Herod Antipas ordered John's imprisonment and ultimately beheading upon the request of Salome, Herodias' daughter.

2. Jesus before Pilate: During the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion (Matthew 14:1-16:20, Mark 6:7-8:30, Luke 9:7-27, John 1:19-19:27), Herod Antipas appears briefly when Jesus is brought before him. In this account (Luke 23:6-12, Mark 15:1-10), the people of Galilee accuse Jesus of being John the Baptist raised from the dead or Elijah. However, unable to find any reason for sentencing Jesus, Herod Antipas sends him back to Pilate for a final verdict.

These stories highlight Herod Antipas' role as a local ruler in Judea and Galilee during the time of Jesus and his connection with significant figures in Christian history such as John the Baptist and Jesus Christ.
