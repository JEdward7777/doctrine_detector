  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a strong answer by accurately referencing a Bible verse and summarizing Jesus' command to His disciples to spread the Gospel message to all nations. However, the reference answer from the teacher provides a more comprehensive and specific response, highlighting the importance of making disciples, baptizing them, and teaching them to obey all of Jesus' commands. The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the Great Commission but could be improved by incorporating the additional elements emphasized in the reference answer."
