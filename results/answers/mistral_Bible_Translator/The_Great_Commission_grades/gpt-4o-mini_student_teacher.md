 The command that Jesus gave to His disciples just before His ascension to Heaven is recorded in Acts 1:8 of the New Testament: "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." This command is often summarized as Jesus instructing His disciples to go forth and spread the Gospel message to all nations.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a strong answer by accurately referencing a Bible verse and summarizing Jesus' command to His disciples to spread the Gospel message to all nations. However, the reference answer from the teacher provides a more comprehensive and specific response, highlighting the importance of making disciples, baptizing them, and teaching them to obey all of Jesus' commands. The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the Great Commission but could be improved by incorporating the additional elements emphasized in the reference answer.
