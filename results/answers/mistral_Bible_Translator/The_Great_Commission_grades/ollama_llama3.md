## [Answer](../The_Great_Commission.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The command that Jesus gave to His disciples just before His ascension to Heaven is recorded in Acts 1:8 of the New Testament: "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." This command is often summarized as Jesus instructing His disciples to go forth and spread the Gospel message to all nations.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 80

Comment: The response accurately summarizes the command given by Jesus to His disciples in Matthew 28:19, which is often referred to as the Great Commission. However, it does not explicitly mention the commission's context in Acts 1:8 or the specific instruction to spread the Gospel message to all nations, which are important aspects of understanding the mission of discipleship in this context.

To improve the response and achieve a higher grade, it would be beneficial to provide more detail about the commission and its connection to Jesus' command in Acts 1:8.
