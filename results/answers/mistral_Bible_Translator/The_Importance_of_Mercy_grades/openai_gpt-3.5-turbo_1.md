 According to James 2:13 (NIV), "Mercy triumphs over judgment." This verse suggests that the principle of mercy plays a significant role in God's judgment towards us. It implies that God's merciful nature is more powerful than His judgment, meaning that when we demonstrate compassion and mercy towards others, it reflects God's character and may influence God's judgement on our actions. However, it is essential to remember that our salvation ultimately comes through faith in Jesus Christ (John 3:16).
