  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid and accurate explanation of the relationship between the terms \"Jesus\" and \"Christ\" from a Christian perspective. It correctly distinguishes \"Jesus\" as the individual person and \"Christ\" as a title meaning \"anointed one.\" The connection to Old Testament prophecies and the application of the title to Jesus post-resurrection are well explained. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound answer."
