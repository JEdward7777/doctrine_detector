  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:** This is a well-researched and accurate explanation of the relationship between the terms \"Jesus\" and \"Christ\" from a Christian perspective. It clearly demonstrates an understanding of the theological significance of both terms and their connection to the Messiah. The student provides a clear explanation of the meaning of \"Christ\" as a title and its connection to the ritual of anointing in both the Old and New Testaments."
