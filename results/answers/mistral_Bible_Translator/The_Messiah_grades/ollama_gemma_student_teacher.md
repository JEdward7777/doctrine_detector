## [Answer](../The_Messiah.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, Jesus and Christ are closely related but distinct terms. The term "Jesus" is a proper noun that refers specifically to the individual person, Jesus of Nazareth, born of Mary and who lived during the 1st century in Palestine.

The term "Christ," on the other hand, is not a surname but rather a title or an office. In Greek, "Christ" comes from the word "Χριστός (Christós)," which means "anointed one." In the Old Testament (Hebrew: מָשִׁיחַ, Māšîaḥ) this anointing was a ritual performed with oil that consecrated individuals to certain offices or roles.

So, Jesus is an individual person who fulfilled the role of the "Christ" or Messiah (Anointed One), as prophesied in the Old Testament scriptures. The New Testament writers applied this title to Jesus after his resurrection to indicate that he was the promised Messiah, the savior and redeemer of humanity. In some translations of the Bible, you might see "Jesus Christ," where "Christ" functions as a surname or part of his full name.
