  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 95/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the difference between prayer and talking to a false god from a Christian perspective. They clearly articulate the essence of prayer as a communication with the one true God, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging God's attributes, seeking guidance, and building a personal relationship with him. The connection between prayer and true relationship with the divine is especially insightful. The reference to Matthew 4:10 further strengthens the argument against addressing non-existent entities. Overall, this is a well-written and articulate response that aligns well with the teacher's reference answer."
