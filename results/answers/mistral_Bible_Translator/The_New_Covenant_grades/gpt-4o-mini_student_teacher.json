  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 90.\n\nThe student provides a well-explained and in-depth understanding of the transition from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant, referencing both Jeremiah 31:33 and Hebrews 8:10. They effectively explain how God's law being written on believers' hearts signifies a spiritual transformation and the internalization of God's moral principles. The student also emphasizes the importance of love, obedience, and the role of the Holy Spirit in enabling believers to live out God's will.\n\nThe student's response closely aligns with the reference answer from the teacher, demonstrating a strong comprehension of the concept. The only minor feedback could be to include a more direct connection to the personal knowledge of God mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a well-done and thorough explanation with a strong biblical foundation."
