 According to the New Testament, being glorified with Christ refers to the ultimate destiny and transformation of every true believer in Jesus Christ. This concept is rooted in the doctrine of the resurrection and the return of Christ, as described in various books such as John, Romans, and Revelation.

In 2 Corinthians 3:18, it says, "And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit." This passage highlights the ongoing transformation believers experience as they grow in their faith and become more like Christ.

In John 17:22-23, Jesus prays to the Father, "The glory that you have given me I have given them, so that they may be one, as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me." This passage illustrates the unity between believers and Christ and shows that believers will share in the same glory that Jesus has.

Finally, in 1 Thessalonians 2:12, Paul writes, "We appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain. For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no harm to anyone at all, even though we speak thus. For though we live in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh." Paul is reminding believers that their earthly lives should reflect the transformation they have experienced and that their ultimate destination is to be glorified with Christ when He returns.

In summary, being glorified with Christ means that believers will share in Christ's glory at His second coming, having been transformed by Him during their earthly lives and living in unity with Him.

Grade: 88

Comment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the concept of believers being glorified with Christ according to the New Testament. The references to 2 Corinthians, John, and 1 Thessalonians are appropriate and supportive of the explanation given. However, there could have been a deeper exploration of the theological implications and significance of being glorified with Christ, such as the implications for eternal life, the defeat of sin and death, and the restoration of the relationship between God and humanity. Such elaboration would have enhanced the answer even further.
