  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer supported by relevant Bible verses that address the concept of believers being glorified with Christ. They effectively explained the transformation believers undergo and the unity with Christ in sharing His glory. The student could improve their answer by focusing more on the central theme of believers being transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection, as emphasized in the reference answer."
