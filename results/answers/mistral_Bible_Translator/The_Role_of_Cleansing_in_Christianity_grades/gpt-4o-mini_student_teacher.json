  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of how the concept of cleansing is viewed in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting the shift from external rituals to internal transformation through faith in Jesus Christ. The student effectively connects the Old Testament practices of cleansing through sacrifices and rituals to the New Testament teachings on sin and redemption through Jesus' sacrifice, illustrating a deeper understanding of the significance of Christ's redemptive work. However, there could be more direct integration of the reference answer provided by the teacher to align the student's response more closely with the specified concern."
