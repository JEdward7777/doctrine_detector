The explanation aligns well with the concern provided and emphasizes the significance of Christ's redemptive work in relation to the concept of cleansing throughout both Old and New Testaments. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a few more specific Old Testament references to further illustrate the contrast between the two periods."
