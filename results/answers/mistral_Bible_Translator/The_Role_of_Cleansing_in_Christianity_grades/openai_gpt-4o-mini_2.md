 In the Old Testament, the concept of 'cleansing' is closely related to rituals for atoning for sin, as outlined in Leviticus and other books. These rituals were primarily focused on external purifications such as sacrifices, washings, and observance of laws. They served to remind the Israelites of their sinfulness and God's holiness, but did not remove the fundamental issue of sin from the heart.

In contrast, the New Testament teachings about sin and redemption revolve around Jesus Christ. Through His death and resurrection, He provides a perfect and eternal cleansing for our sins (1 John 1:7). This cleansing is not based on external rituals but on an internal transformation brought about by faith in Jesus (Acts 2:38, Romans 5:9).

This spiritual cleansing frees us from the power of sin and reconciles us to God (Colossians 1:21-22). It is not a one-time event but an ongoing process as we grow in our relationship with Christ and strive to live according to His teachings. This ongoing sanctification, or making holy, is also referred to as 'cleansing' in the New Testament (1 John 3:3).

So, while the Old Testament concept of cleansing focuses on external rituals for atonement, the New Testament teaching emphasizes an internal spiritual transformation through faith in Jesus Christ that leads to ongoing sanctification. This new and eternal relationship with God is the true source of cleansing from sin.
