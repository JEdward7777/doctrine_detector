  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid understanding of the concept of being \"chosen\" in the context of figures like Moses and King David in the Old Testament. The student effectively explains that God's selection process is rooted in His sovereignty and emphasizes obedience, faithfulness, and God's grace in the chosen individuals' roles. The explanation is clear, focused, and aligns well with Christian doctrine. It could have been strengthened with additional references to specific biblical passages where Moses and David were chosen by God, but overall, it demonstrates a good grasp of the topic."
