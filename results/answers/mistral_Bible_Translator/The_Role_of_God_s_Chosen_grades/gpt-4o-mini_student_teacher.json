  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and insightful explanation of how figures like Moses and King David were considered \"chosen\" by God based on their roles in leading and guiding the people of Israel. The student effectively highlights the concept of God's sovereignty in selecting leaders and emphasizes the importance of obedience and faithfulness in response to God's call. The only slight deviation from the reference answer is the additional emphasis on the believers' salvation by God's grace and choice, which, though valid, is slightly outside the scope of the given concern. Overall, a well-written and insightful response from the student."
