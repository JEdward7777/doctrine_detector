 In the Old Testament, figures like Moses and King David were considered "chosen" by God due to their unique roles in leading and guiding the people of Israel. This concept is rooted in the belief that God has a special relationship with his chosen people (Israel) and that certain individuals within this group are selected for specific tasks or positions based on their faithfulness, obedience, and God-given abilities.

The term "chosen" implies that these individuals were singled out by God for a purpose. They were not necessarily chosen because of any inherent qualities or virtues they possessed; rather, it was God's sovereign will to use them as instruments to accomplish His plans and purposes. This concept is highlighted in several passages throughout the Old Testament, such as Deuteronomy 7:6-8, where God promises to bless the Israelites because He has chosen them, not because they were more numerous or powerful than other nations but because He loved them.

Regarding God's selection process, it implies that He is completely sovereign and in control of all things, including choosing whom He will use for His purposes. This underscores the idea that God works through human beings to accomplish His divine plan, as well as emphasizing the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God in response to His call. It also serves to remind believers that they are not saved by their own merit or ability but solely by God's grace and choice.

In summary, figures like Moses and King David were considered "chosen" because they were called and used by God for specific tasks or roles in leading Israel. This highlights God's sovereignty in choosing whom He will use to accomplish His purposes, emphasizing the importance of obedience and faithfulness in response to His call.
