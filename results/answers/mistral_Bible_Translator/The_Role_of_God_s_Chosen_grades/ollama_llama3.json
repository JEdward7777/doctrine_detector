  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of highlighting God's sovereignty in choosing leaders, specifically Moses and King David. It also correctly emphasizes that God's selection is based on His divine purpose and plans for leadership among His followers. The mention of passages like Deuteronomy 7:6-8 is also relevant to the concern of recognizing God's sovereignty.\n\nHowever, the response could have delved deeper into the implications of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders for the Christian community. For example, it would have been helpful to explore how this concept affects our understanding of authority and leadership within the church, or how it shapes our approach to prayer and discernment when seeking guidance from God.\n\nAdditionally, while the response mentions obedience and faithfulness as important responses to God's call, it could have also explored what this means for those who are not explicitly chosen by God for a specific task or role. How do we navigate our own roles and responsibilities in light of God's sovereignty?\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding God's sovereignty in appointing leaders, but could benefit from further development to fully address the concern."
