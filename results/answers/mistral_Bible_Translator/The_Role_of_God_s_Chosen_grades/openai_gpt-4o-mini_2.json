It effectively connects the chosen status of Moses and King David to God's divine purpose and plans for leadership. The only area for improvement would be to incorporate more scriptural references to further support the points made. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview."
