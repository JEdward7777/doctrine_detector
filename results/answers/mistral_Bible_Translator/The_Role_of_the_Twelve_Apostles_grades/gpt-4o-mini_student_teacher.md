## [Answer](../The_Role_of_the_Twelve_Apostles.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Twelve Apostles were significant among Jesus' disciples for several reasons that are deeply rooted in the New Testament of the Bible. Here are some key points:

1. Designated by Jesus: After calling various people to follow Him, Jesus selected twelve individuals to be His apostles (Matthew 10:2-4). This choice emphasized their special role and responsibility.

2. Witnesses of the ministry, miracles, and teachings of Jesus: The Apostles were present during Jesus' earthly ministry. They observed His miracles, heard His teachings, and learned from Him directly (Matthew 17:1; John 15:15).

3. Witnesses to the Resurrection: After Jesus' crucifixion, the Apostles were essential witnesses to His resurrection, providing validation of His divinity and fulfillment of prophecy (Matthew 28:16-20; John 20:24-31).

4. Spreading the Gospel: After Pentecost (Acts 2), the Apostles were instrumental in spreading the message of Jesus Christ to both Jews and Gentiles, establishing churches throughout the known world (Acts 8; 15:7).

5. Authority figures: The Apostles held a unique position as those chosen by Jesus Himself and authorized to act on His behalf. This authority included preaching, teaching, and performing miracles in Jesus' name (Matthew 28:18-20; Ephesians 2:20).

6. Foundational apostles and apostles of the seven churches: In his letter to the churches in Asia Minor (Revelation 2-3), Jesus refers to John as the one "who is alive" (vs. 1) and identifies himself as the "Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and feet like burnished bronze" (vs. 14). This suggests that the apostles were foundational to the early Christian church and played crucial roles in its establishment.

In summary, the Twelve Apostles were significant among Jesus' disciples because they were chosen by Him, witnessed His ministry, miracles, and teachings, saw His resurrection, spread the Gospel, held authority as representatives of Christ, and played a foundational role in establishing the early Christian church.
