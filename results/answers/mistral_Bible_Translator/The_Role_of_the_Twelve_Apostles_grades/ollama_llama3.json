  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the significance of the Twelve Apostles in Christian belief and ministry, citing various biblical passages to support its points. It covers the apostles' selection by Jesus, their role as witnesses to His ministry and teachings, their involvement in spreading the Gospel, and their authority as representatives of Christ.\n\nThe response also acknowledges the apostles' foundational role in establishing the early Christian church, which is particularly relevant to the concern of recognizing their importance.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response does not go beyond a general overview. It could be more detailed and nuanced in its discussion of the apostles' roles and significance. Additionally, some of the points made could be further developed or supported with additional biblical references.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern and provides a solid foundation for understanding the importance of the Twelve Apostles in Christian belief and ministry."
