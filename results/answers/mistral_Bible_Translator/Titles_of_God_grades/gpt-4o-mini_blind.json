  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a thorough explanation of various titles used in the Bible to refer to God as Almighty, including their Hebrew and Greek origins and implications. The references to El Shaddai, Pantokrator, Jehovah, Elohim, and Adonai are all accurate and well explained, showcasing a good understanding of the topic. However, to improve the grade, linking these titles more explicitly to the concept of God's omnipotence and sovereignty as the Almighty would enhance doctrinal correctness."
