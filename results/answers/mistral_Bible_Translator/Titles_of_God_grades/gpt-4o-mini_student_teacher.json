  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and detailed list of titles used in the Bible that refer to God as Almighty, demonstrating a strong understanding of the question. However, they included some titles that were not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer, such as \"Pantokrator,\" which could lead to a slight deduction in grade. It is important to align the response closely with the given reference answer in order to fully address the concern of enhancing understanding of God's character."
