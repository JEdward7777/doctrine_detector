## [Answer](../Titles_of_God.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, there are several titles or attributes that depict God as Almighty (El Shaddai in Hebrew and Pantokrator in Greek). Here are a few examples:

1. El Shaddai (אֵל שַׁדָי): This title appears forty-nine times in the Old Testament, primarily in the book of Genesis but also throughout other books like Exodus, Numbers, and Hosea. It is often translated as "God Almighty" or simply "Almighty God."

2. Pantokrator (Παντοκράτωρ): This title comes from the Greek text of the New Testament, specifically in Revelation 1:8 and 4:8. It means "Ruler of All" or "Almighty," emphasizing God's sovereignty over all creation.

3. Jehovah (יְהוָה): This is another significant name for God in the Old Testament, often translated as "Lord." However, when it appears in its original Hebrew, it can also imply the idea of self-existence and omnipotence, making it a title that suggests God's Almighty nature.

4. Elohim (אֱלֹהִים): This is a common name for God in the Old Testament, which often appears in the plural form but is used as a singular noun to emphasize the unity of God. While it doesn't directly translate to "Almighty," it suggests God's absolute power and authority.

5. Adonai (אֲדֹנַי): This title for God means "Lord" or "Master," implying God's sovereignty and Almighty nature, especially in the context of His relationship with His people.
