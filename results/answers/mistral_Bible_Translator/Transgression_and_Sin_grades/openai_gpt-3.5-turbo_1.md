# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Transgression, sin, and disobedience are closely interconnected concepts within Christian theology, primarily rooted in the Bible's Old Testament.

Transgression refers to the act or an instance of violating a law, commandment, or moral standard. In this context, it is often used to describe human actions that go against God's will as revealed in the Scriptures.

Sin, on the other hand, is a broader term that encompasses any lack of conformity to the character, nature, or will of God, either through commission (actively doing something wrong) or omission (failing to do what is right).

Disobedience is the willful refusal to comply with God's commands or authority. It is a form of sin that involves intentionally disregarding or rebelling against God's will.

In essence, when one transgresses (violates a law or commandment), they are sinning (failing to conform to God's nature and will) and being disobedient (deliberately refusing to obey God). These concepts are deeply intertwined in the Christian understanding of moral behavior and the human relationship with God.
