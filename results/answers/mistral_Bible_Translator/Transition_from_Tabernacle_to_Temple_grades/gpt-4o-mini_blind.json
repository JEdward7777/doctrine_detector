  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid overview of the reasons for the transition from using the Tabernacle to the establishment of the First Temple in Jerusalem. The student effectively explains the prophetic significance of this transition and the historical context surrounding the Tabernacle's usage. However, a higher grade could be achieved by including more references to relevant biblical passages and theological insights regarding the significance of the Tabernacle in Israelite worship. Additionally, connecting the transition to Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the Tabernacle would provide a richer theological depth to the response."
