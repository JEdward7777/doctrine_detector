They correctly highlighted the significance of the establishment of the First Temple by King Solomon and the prophetic aspect of this transition. Additionally, the student acknowledged that while the Tabernacle was no longer the primary place of worship, its practices were still observed in various forms throughout Israel's history. The answer was well-supported with biblical references and historical context. Great job!"
