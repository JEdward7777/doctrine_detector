## [Answer](../Transition_from_Tabernacle_to_Temple.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle, also known as the Tent of Meeting or Mishkan, after they entered the Promised Land and established the First Temple in Jerusalem under King Solomon (around 950 BC). This transition was prophesied by God through Moses (Deuteronomy 12:5-14) and marked a change from a mobile, temporary sanctuary to a permanent one.

However, it's essential to note that the Tabernacle was never entirely abandoned. During the periods when Israel disobeyed God and was exiled (such as during the Babylonian captivity), the practices and rituals associated with the Tabernacle were not performed. This situation changed once they returned from exile, but they no longer had a mobile sanctuary.

The First Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC, leading to another period of exile. After the return from exile and the rebuilding of the Second Temple (around 516 BC), the Jewish people continued practicing their religious rituals at the temple, but the Tabernacle itself was not reinstated as a permanent structure.

In summary, the Israelites stopped using the Tabernacle as their primary place of worship after entering the Promised Land and establishing the First Temple in Jerusalem. This change was prophesied by God through Moses and marked a shift from a mobile sanctuary to a more stable one. However, the practices associated with the Tabernacle were maintained in various forms throughout Israel's history.
