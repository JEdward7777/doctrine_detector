  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and informative response that clearly explains the transition from the Tabernacle to the Temple in biblical history. It provides a concise explanation of the prophetic change foretold by God through Moses and demonstrates a clear understanding of the historical context. The inclusion of information about the temporary abandonment of the Tabernacle practices during exiles adds nuance to the discussion."
