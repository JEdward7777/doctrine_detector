It accurately highlights the prophesied shift from a mobile sanctuary to a permanent one and addresses the continuity of certain rituals despite the change in physical structures. The reference to relevant biblical passages adds depth to the explanation. Great job in addressing the concern with a Christian worldview perspective."
