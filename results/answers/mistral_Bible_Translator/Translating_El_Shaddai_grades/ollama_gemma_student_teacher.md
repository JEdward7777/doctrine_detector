The literal translation of "El Shaddai" is debated among scholars but generally accepted to mean "God Almighty."

Here's how this phrase has been translated into various languages based on local Bible translations:

1. English (King James Version): God Almighty
2. Spanish (Reina-Valera): Dios Todopoderoso

4. German (Luther Bible): Gott allein Fürst und Mächtig
5. Italian (Diodati translation): Dio Potentissimo
6. Dutch (Statenvertaling): God Almachtig
7. Arabic (Peshitta): אל שדי, which is phonetically transliterated as "Allāh Qudūs" in modern Standard Arabic Bibles
