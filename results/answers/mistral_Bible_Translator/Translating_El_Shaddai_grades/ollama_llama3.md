 The phrase "El Shaddai" appears multiple times in the Old Testament, most notably in Genesis 17:1 and 28:3. It is a significant name of God in Hebrew and carries deep theological implications. The literal translation of "El Shaddai" is debated among scholars but generally accepted to mean "God Almighty."

Here's how this phrase has been translated into various languages based on local Bible translations:

1. English (King James Version): God Almighty
2. Spanish (Reina-Valera): Dios Todopoderoso
3. French (Louis Segond version): Dieu tout-puissant
4. German (Luther Bible): Gott allein Fürst und Mächtig
5. Italian (Diodati translation): Dio Potentissimo
6. Dutch (Statenvertaling): God Almachtig
7. Arabic (Peshitta): אל שדי, which is phonetically transliterated as "Allāh Qudūs" in modern Standard Arabic Bibles
8. Russian (Synodal Version of the Bible): Бог Вседержительный (Bog Vsesderzhitel'nyy)
9. Chinese (Chinese Union Version): 神之强者, which translates as "Shén zhī Liángzé"
10. Japanese (Tanaka Version): 全能の神, which translates as "Zennō no kami"

It's essential to note that translation is not always straightforward and can vary depending on cultural nuances, the target audience of the Bible translation, and the specific translation method used by the translators. The primary goal remains to accurately convey the meaning and theology intended in the original Hebrew text while also maintaining readability for contemporary audiences in their respective languages.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the meaning and significance of "El Shaddai" and provides accurate information about its translation into various languages. The example list showing different translations from different Bible versions is particularly helpful in illustrating the challenge of accurately representing God's name across cultures and languages.

However, there are some areas where the response could be improved. For instance, it does not fully address the concern about ensuring accuracy. While the response mentions that "El Shaddai" can be translated as "God Almighty", it does not provide a nuanced discussion about the challenges of translation or the importance of considering cultural nuances and target audiences.

Additionally, the response does not engage deeply with the theological implications of God's name "Shaddai". While it provides some background information on the phrase, it could have explored more thoroughly how this name reflects God's character and attributes, which is particularly important in a Christian context.

Overall, while the response provides useful information about the translation of "El Shaddai", it could be strengthened by a deeper exploration of the theological implications and a more nuanced discussion of the challenges of translation.
