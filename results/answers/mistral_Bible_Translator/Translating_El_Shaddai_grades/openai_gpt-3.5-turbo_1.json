  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough overview of the translation of the phrase \"El Shaddai\" into various languages and acknowledges the complexity of translation across different cultures. It accurately conveys that the spelling and translation of the name may vary based on phonetics and language nuances. The concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures is adequately addressed. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly emphasize the importance of preserving the theological significance and reverence of the name 'El Shaddai' in all translations to maintain the integrity of representing God's name."
