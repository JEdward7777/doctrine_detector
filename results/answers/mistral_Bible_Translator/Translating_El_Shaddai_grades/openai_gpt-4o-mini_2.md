 The phrase "El Shaddai" appears multiple times in the Old Testament, most notably in Genesis 17:1 and 28:3. It is a significant name of God in Hebrew and carries deep theological implications. The literal translation of "El Shaddai" is debated among scholars but generally accepted to mean "God Almighty."

Here's how this phrase has been translated into various languages based on local Bible translations:

1. English (King James Version): God Almighty
2. Spanish (Reina-Valera): Dios Todopoderoso
3. French (Louis Segond version): Dieu tout-puissant
4. German (Luther Bible): Gott allein Fürst und Mächtig
5. Italian (Diodati translation): Dio Potentissimo
6. Dutch (Statenvertaling): God Almachtig
7. Arabic (Peshitta): אל שדי, which is phonetically transliterated as "Allāh Qudūs" in modern Standard Arabic Bibles
