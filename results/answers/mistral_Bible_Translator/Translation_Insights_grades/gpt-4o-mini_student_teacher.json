  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided insightful translations for the phrase 'image of God' when applied to humans and Jesus, showcasing a clear understanding of the significance of these translations in emphasizing the relationship between humans and God, and Jesus's divine nature. However, the student's translations do not fully align with the teacher's reference answer, missing some key nuances such as 'created to be like him' for humans and 'exact likeness of God' for Jesus. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated but some improvement in aligning with the reference answer is needed for a higher grade."
