## [Answer](../Translation_Insights.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1. Image of God (Human): The Hebrew term used in Genesis 1:26-27 is "tselem," which means a representation or likeness of something. In the context of humanity, it suggests that humans bear an image of God in their character and function as His vice-regents on Earth. Some suggested translations for this concept could be:
   - Imago Dei (Latin)
   - Divine Reflection
   - God's Representative
   - God's Likeness

   These translations emphasize the unique relationship between humans and their Creator, highlighting the inherent dignity and worth of every individual.

2. Image of God (Jesus): In the New Testament, Colossians 1:15 states that Jesus is "the image of the invisible God." The Greek term used here is "eikon," which is akin to "tselem" in the Old Testament. This phrase emphasizes Jesus's divine nature and His perfect representation of the character and will of God. Suggested translations for this concept could be:
   - Image of the Invisible God (NASB)
   - The Radiance of God's Glory and the Exact Representation of His Being (NEB)
   - The Very Image of God (ESV, KJV)

   These translations remind us that Jesus is the perfect expression of God's love, mercy, justice, and truth, making Him an example for all believers to follow.
