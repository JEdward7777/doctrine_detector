## Question [Translation Practices](../../questions/Translation_Practices.md)
Why do many Bible translations use 'LORD' in place of 'Yahweh'?

## Target answer from notes
Many Bible translations use 'LORD' to show respect for God's name due to historical traditions where the Jewish people feared mispronouncing 'Yahweh.'

## Concern to grade by
Clarity in the translation of sacred texts and maintaining reverence for God's name.

## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Many modern English Bible translations, including the New International Version (NIV), the King James Version (KJV), and the New Living Translation (NLT), often translate the Hebrew name "Yahweh" as "LORD" using all capital letters. This practice comes from the historical tradition known as the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) where the divine name was too sacred to be spoken aloud by Jewish people, and instead was replaced with "Adonai" (Lord in Hebrew).

This custom has been carried over into many English translations of the Bible as a way to honor this tradition while still providing a translation of the original text. It is important to note that using "LORD" does not diminish the significance or holiness of God's name, but rather recognizes the reverence and awe with which it was held in ancient times.

In some translations, such as the Jewish Publication Society (JPS) Tanakh and the New Jewish Version (NJV), the Tetragrammaton is translated as "Yahweh" to reflect the original Hebrew text more closely. However, even in these translations, "Adonai" is often used where the name appears in the original text but was replaced by scribes with "Adonai."

Ultimately, the choice of translation depends on the purpose and audience of each particular version of the Bible, as well as the preferences and beliefs of the translators themselves. As a Christian Bible translator, it is crucial to remain faithful to the original texts while being sensitive to the cultural and historical contexts in which they were written.
