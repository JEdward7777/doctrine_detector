  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that shows a good understanding of the reasons behind the use of \"LORD\" in Bible translations. They have touched on historical traditions and reverence for God's name, although they could have tied it back more explicitly to the concern provided. Overall, the student's response demonstrates a strong grasp of the topic and a thoughtful analysis from a Christian worldview."
