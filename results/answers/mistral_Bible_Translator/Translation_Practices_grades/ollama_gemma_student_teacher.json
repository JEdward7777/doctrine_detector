  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and thoughtfully written response that effectively addresses the concern for clarity and reverence in Bible translation. The student demonstrates a deep understanding of the historical and cultural context of the Tetragrammaton and its significance in both ancient and modern translations. The inclusion of specific examples of translations that use both \"LORD\" and \"Yahweh\" adds depth to the analysis."
