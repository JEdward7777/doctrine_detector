# Question [Translation Practices](../../../questions/Translation_Practices.md)
Why do many Bible translations use 'LORD' in place of 'Yahweh'?

Many Bible translations use 'LORD' to show respect for God's name due to historical traditions where the Jewish people feared mispronouncing 'Yahweh.'

# Stated Concern
Clarity in the translation of sacred texts and maintaining reverence for God's name.

# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Many modern English Bible translations, including the New International Version (NIV), the King James Version (KJV), and the New Living Translation (NLT), often translate the Hebrew name "Yahweh" as "LORD" using all capital letters. This practice comes from the historical tradition known as the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) where the divine name was too sacred to be spoken aloud by Jewish people, and instead was replaced with "Adonai" (Lord in Hebrew).

This custom has been carried over into many English translations of the Bible as a way to honor this tradition while still providing a translation of the original text. It is important to note that using "LORD" does not diminish the significance or holiness of God's name, but rather recognizes the reverence and awe with which it was held in ancient times.

In some translations, such as the Jewish Publication Society (JPS) Tanakh and the New Jewish Version (NJV), the Tetragrammaton is translated as "Yahweh" to reflect the original Hebrew text more closely. However, even in these translations, "Adonai" is often used where the name appears in the original text but was replaced by scribes with "Adonai."

Ultimately, the choice of translation depends on the purpose and audience of each particular version of the Bible, as well as the preferences and beliefs of the translators themselves. As a Christian Bible translator, it is crucial to remain faithful to the original texts while being sensitive to the cultural and historical contexts in which they were written.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of why many Bible translations use "LORD" instead of "Yahweh" to show respect for God's name, taking into account the historical traditions and cultural sensitivity involved. It emphasizes the importance of clarity in translation while maintaining reverence for God's name, aligning well with the Christian worldview. The only slight improvement could be to incorporate more explicitly Christian theological perspectives on the sacredness of God's name. Overall, a strong and informative response.
