  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and thoughtful list of alternative translations for the phrase 'to be zealous' that accurately reflect its biblical meaning. The examples given are well-supported with relevant biblical references, demonstrating a solid understanding of the concept of zeal in Scripture. However, it would have been beneficial to include a couple more direct biblical references for each translation to further solidify the connections. Overall, a strong effort with room for minor improvement."
