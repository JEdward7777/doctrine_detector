  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and thorough explanation of alternative translations for the phrase 'to be zealous' that reflect its biblical meaning. The examples given from various Bible verses helped to illustrate the intensity and fervor associated with zeal in the Christian faith. However, the student could have incorporated more direct references to the teacher's reference answer to show a clearer connection between the translations provided and the specified concern of understanding the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith."
