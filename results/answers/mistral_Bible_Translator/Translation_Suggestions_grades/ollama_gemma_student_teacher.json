  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical meaning of \"to be zealous\" and provides accurate and insightful translations. The student correctly highlights the intensity, passion, and commitment associated with zeal in various passages from the Old and New Testaments. The explanations are clear and well-supported by scripture references. However, including the suggested answer from the teacher would have enhanced the comprehensiveness of the response."
