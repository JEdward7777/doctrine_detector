  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe student provides six alternative translations for \"to be zealous\", which demonstrates their understanding of different ways to convey the concept of zeal in various contexts. The examples they provide from Scripture also show an awareness of how zeal is used in biblical passages.\n\nHowever, I deduct some points because the student could have explored the concern about understanding the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith more deeply. While they do mention that different translations can aid in grasping this concept, they don't explicitly connect their examples to the idea of intense commitment or how it relates to Christian living.\n\nOverall, the response is clear and demonstrates a good grasp of various translations for \"to be zealous\", but could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern about intensity of commitment."
