These alternatives offer valuable insights into the depth and nuances of the concept. However, the student could have connected their translations more directly to the teacher's reference answer, which highlighted terms like 'faithful love,' 'loyal, committed love,' and 'loving dependability.' By making this connection, the student could have demonstrated a deeper understanding and integration of the material. Overall, a strong effort with room for improvement in connecting translations to the reference answer."
