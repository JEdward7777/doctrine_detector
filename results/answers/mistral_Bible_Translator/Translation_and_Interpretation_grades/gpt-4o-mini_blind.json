  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and insightful explanation of how the translation of \"Lord\" differs in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people in Christian Bible translations. The student effectively emphasizes the unique divine nature of God when using the term \"Lord\" in reference to Him, highlighting His sovereignty, omnipotence, and holiness. The inclusion of biblical examples, such as Moses and Jesus, helps illustrate the distinction between addressing God as \"Lord\" versus using it for human beings. The response could have further elaborated on the significance of the Hebrew word \"Adonai\" and the Greek word \"Kyrios\" in conveying the reverence and authority associated with God as \"Lord.\" Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound explanation."
