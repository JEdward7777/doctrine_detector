  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 85.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive explanation of how the term \"Lord\" differs in contexts referring to God versus ordinary people, emphasizing the distinct divine nature of God when this term is used. They correctly highlight the implications of using 'Lord' for God and showcase examples from scripture to support their points. However, the student could improve their answer by directly addressing the concern about the proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impacting the understanding of scripture and the nature of God. The teacher's reference answer also provides a specific linguistic distinction that the student did not directly incorporate into their response.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the theological implications behind the translation of 'Lord' in different contexts, but could further connect their explanation to the concern provided."
