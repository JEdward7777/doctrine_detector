It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of understanding the proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms for a correct understanding of scripture and the nature of God. The only slight deduction is due to the lack of explicit mention of the capitalization of 'Lord' when referring to God in the initial response, which could have further emphasized the significance of this distinction."
