## [Answer](../Translation_of_Abomination.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the biblical context, the term "abomination" (Hebrew: תועבה, to'evah; Greek: βδελυγμα, bdelugma) denotes something detestable or abhorrent to God. It is often used in reference to practices that are considered immoral, idolatrous, or ceremonially unclean according to the laws of ancient Israel and Judaism.

When translating this term into modern languages, it is essential to preserve its strong connotations of moral repugnance and God's disapproval. Here are some possible options for conveying the meaning of "abomination" in a biblical context:

1. Detestable act/practice (e.g., Leviticus 18:22, "Do not lie with a male as one lies with a woman; it is an abomination.")
2. Loathsome thing (e.g., Deuteronomy 7:26, "Neither shall you bring the abominations of the nations into your house or speak of their names...")
3. Abhorrent practice/thing (e.g., Ezekiel 44:7, "And they shall not come near to me, nor approach any of my holy things, nor into the inner court, but the abomination of their bodies shall be upon them.")
4. Vile or disgusting act/practice (e.g., Isaiah 66:3, "He who kills an ox is as if he slaughters a man, and he who sacrifices a lamb, as if he breaks a dog's neck; he who offers a grain offering, as if he presents pig's blood, and he who makes a memorial of frankincense, as if he blesses an idol.")
5. Offensive act/practice (e.g., Jeremiah 7:30-31, "Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not hear them in the time of their crisis. What will I do concerning you, O Sworn City, to make you like Sodom and Gomorrah?")
6. Abominable act/practice (e.g., Mark 7:21, "For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery...")

In each case, it is important to ensure that the chosen translation accurately reflects the original meaning of the term while also being accessible and understandable to modern readers.
