The student effectively addressed the concern of accurate translation for understanding biblical texts and the severity of actions against God's laws. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the simplicity and clarity of the translations, as the reference answer suggested using more straightforward language such as 'something God hates,' 'disgusting practice,' or 'very evil action.'"
