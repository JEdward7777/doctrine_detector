2. "Assuredly, I say to you" - Similar to the above, this translation conveys a sense of certainty and assurance in what Jesus is about to say.
3. "Verily, I say unto you" - A more traditional King James Version translation that also emphasizes the truthfulness and authority behind Jesus' statements.
4. "I tell you the truth" or "I solemnly assure you" - These translations convey a sense of solemnity and commitment to the truth in what Jesus is saying.
