  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of potential translations for \"truly\" as used by Jesus, and demonstrated an understanding of the importance of accurately conveying the certainty and authority behind Jesus' words, the answer could be improved by directly referencing the provided reference answer from the teacher. By not incorporating the exact translations provided in the reference answer, the student missed the opportunity to directly align their response with the specified concern of accurate biblical translation and interpretation. Encouraging the student to demonstrate the ability to integrate provided references for a more precise alignment with the concern would enhance their overall response."
