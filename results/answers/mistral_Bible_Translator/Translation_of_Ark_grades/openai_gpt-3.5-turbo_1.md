# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The term "ark" (Hebrew: תֵּבָה, Tevah; Greek: αἴρων, Aerōn) is a central concept in the Bible, most notably associated with Noah's Ark. However, it appears in various contexts throughout the Old Testament and can have slightly different meanings due to its cultural and historical context.

1. Noah's Ark (Genesis 6:14-22): The ark that Noah built to save himself, his family, and the animals from God's wrath during the Great Flood. It is specifically described as a large boat or ship with three levels.

2. Arks of the Covenant (Exodus 25:10-22; Deuteronomy 10:1-5): In this context, "ark" refers to the chest containing the tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments and representing God's presence among Israel. It was placed inside the Holy of Holies within the Tabernacle (and later the Temple).

3. Potsherds or Ark of the Testimony (Joshua 7:6; 24:9): The term "ark" is used to describe the sacred box containing the manna and Aaron's rod, which was kept in the Tabernacle during Israel's wandering in the wilderness.

4. Ark of Jeroboam (1 Kings 13:26): In this case, "ark" refers to a replica of the ark of the covenant that the king of Israel created as a religious symbol for his kingdom, which was later destroyed by King Josiah (2 Kings 23:4).

5. Other instances (e.g., Exodus 2:5; Ezekiel 16:19): In these passages, "ark" is used metaphorically to represent safety or protection, such as when Pharaoh's daughter rescued Moses from the Nile and when God promised Jerusalem protection like an ark.

In translating the Bible, it is essential to maintain the nuances of each usage while ensuring that readers can understand the context-specific meanings.
