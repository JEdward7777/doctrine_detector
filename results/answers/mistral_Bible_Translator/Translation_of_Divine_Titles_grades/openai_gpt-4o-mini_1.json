The suggestions for translations in different languages are well-researched and considerate of maintaining the accurate meaning of God's titles in Scripture. The emphasis on the importance of proper translation to convey the accurate meaning of God's presence and titles in Scripture aligns well with the concern provided. The only slight room for improvement would be to delve deeper into the theological implications and significance behind the translations in different languages."
