The explanation is clear and well-supported by scriptural references. However, the response could benefit from a deeper exploration of the nuances in translating \"Hades\" and \"Sheol\" to capture their full theological significance. Additionally, a more in-depth analysis of the intermediate state and final judgment in relation to these terms could enhance the overall depth of the answer."
