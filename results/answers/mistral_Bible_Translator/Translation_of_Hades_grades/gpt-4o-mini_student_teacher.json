  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed explanation of the biblical meanings and nuances of \"Sheol\" and \"Hades\" and offered appropriate translation options that respect their biblical contexts. They have shown a good understanding of the theological implications of these terms. The student's translation options align well with maintaining accurate biblical representation for greater understanding among believers. However, the student could have integrated more direct biblical references to support their translation choices, which would have enhanced the overall accuracy and depth of the response."
