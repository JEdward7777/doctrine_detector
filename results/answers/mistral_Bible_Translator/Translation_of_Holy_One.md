## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Translating religious terms requires sensitivity and understanding of cultural nuances. The term "Holy One" is used in the Bible to refer to God, as well as to certain individuals who are set apart for divine service. Here's how it could be translated in various languages:

1. Spanish: Santo (masculine) or Santa (feminine), depending on the gender of the noun in context. For example, "El Santo" or "La Santa".

2. French: Saint (masculine) or Sainte (feminine). For example, "Le Saint" or "La Sainte".

3. German: Heiliger (masculine or neutral) or Heilige (feminine). For example, "Der Heilige" or "Die Heilige".

4. Italian: Santo (masculine) or Santa (feminine). For example, "Il Santo" or "La Santa".

5. Russian: Святой (male or neutral) or Святая (female), both translate as "Holy". For example, "Святой" or "Святая".

6. Chinese: 圣者 (shèng zhě). The characters 圣 (shèng) mean holy and 者 (zhě) means person, so it literally translates to "holy person". However, the term can be adjusted according to context. For example, 神圣的人 (shén shèng de rén), meaning "Holy People" in the context of Exodus 19:6 where God refers to the Israelites as a holy nation.

7. Arabic: العذيم (al-'Azīm) can be used to express the concept of holiness. For example, هو العذيم (huwa al-'Azīm) translates to "He is the Holy One". In the context of individuals, the term الصحابة الأربعة المقدسة (al-ṣaḥābah al-arbaʿat al-muqaddasah) refers to the Four Holy Women in Islamic tradition.

8. Japanese: 聖なる (seinaru), which can be used to describe both God and individuals who are set apart for divine service, although it's more commonly used in a religious context when referring to deities or divine beings. For example, 聖なる神 (Seinaru kami) translates to "Holy God".
