  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive and culturally sensitive overview of translating the term \"Holy One\" into various languages. The explanations are clear and demonstrate an understanding of the nuances involved in conveying the concept of holiness across different linguistic contexts. However, to improve, the student could have included more specific biblical references or theological insights related to the term \"Holy One\" to strengthen the connection to Christian doctrine."
