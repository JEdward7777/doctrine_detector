  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough list of suggested translations for the term \"predestined\" and offers a solid explanation of the concept within Christianity. They correctly emphasize the importance of understanding the broader theological framework surrounding predestination. However, the student could improve their grade by incorporating the more concise translations provided in the teacher's reference answer. Striving for greater precision and conciseness in their response would enhance the accuracy of understanding biblical translations related to predestination."
