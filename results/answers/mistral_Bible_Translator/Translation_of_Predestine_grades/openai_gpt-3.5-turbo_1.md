# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1. "Predestined": This term is often used to translate several Greek words in the New Testament, primarily "proorizo" and "telesplanos." Other possible translations include:

   - "Foreordained"
   - "Destined"
   - "Decreed"
   - "Planned ahead of time"
   - "Predetermined"

It is essential to understand that the concept of predestination in Christianity involves God's sovereignty over human actions and events, but it does not imply a deterministic view of fate where humans have no free will. A careful examination of relevant scriptures should be made to grasp the full context and significance of these concepts within the broader Christian theological framework.
