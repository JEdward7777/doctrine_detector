  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough and well-organized response that addresses various important considerations when translating the term \"Rabbi\" in different languages. They cover historical, cultural, theological, and practical aspects of translation, showing a good understanding of the complexity involved. However, the response could be improved by more directly addressing the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. The student's answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the need to convey the unique and divine nature of Jesus' teaching role, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a solid response with valuable insights, but could have been more focused on the specific concern raised."
