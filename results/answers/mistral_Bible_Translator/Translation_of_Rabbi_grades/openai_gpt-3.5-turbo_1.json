  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response covers a wide range of important considerations for translating the term \"Rabbi\" with a specific focus on theological consistency and respect for tradition. It emphasizes the significance of accurately representing Jesus' role as a teacher within the Christian faith. However, it could have more directly addressed the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith by providing more specific examples or recommendations related to this concern. Despite this, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the complexity involved in translating religious titles and concepts."
