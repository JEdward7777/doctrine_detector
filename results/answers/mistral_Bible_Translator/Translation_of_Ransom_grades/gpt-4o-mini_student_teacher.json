  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of translations for the term \"ransom\" in various languages, demonstrating an understanding of the theological concept across different linguistic contexts. The translations effectively convey the idea of redemption, liberation, or deliverance through a payment. However, the translations could have been more closely aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher, emphasizing the concept of making a payment to secure freedom. Overall, a solid effort in capturing the essence of the term \"ransom\" in different languages."
