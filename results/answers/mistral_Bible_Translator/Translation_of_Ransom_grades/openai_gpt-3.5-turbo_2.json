The focus on the action of making a payment to secure freedom aligns well with Christian teachings on redemption through the sacrifice of Jesus as a ransom for many. The attention to accuracy and consistency in theological terms across languages is commendable, although some languages may require further nuance in translation to fully capture the depth of the biblical concept of ransom."
