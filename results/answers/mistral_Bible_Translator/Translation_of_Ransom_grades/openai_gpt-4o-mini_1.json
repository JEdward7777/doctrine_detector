  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for the term \"ransom\" in various languages, reflecting a strong understanding of the concept across different linguistic and cultural contexts. The answer effectively explains the biblical meaning of \"ransom\" as 'pay to release,' 'buy back,' or 'penalty paid,' which aligns well with Christian theology. The concern regarding accurately understanding theological terms across different contexts is adequately addressed in the response."
