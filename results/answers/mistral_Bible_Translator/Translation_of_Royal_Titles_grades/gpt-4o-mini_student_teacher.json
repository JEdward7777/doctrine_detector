  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in different languages, which shows good research effort. However, the concern specified ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' or using a natural way of addressing a ruler in the target language. While the student's translations are accurate, they could have included more context on why certain translations may be more appropriate or respectful in a biblical sense, aligning more closely with the teacher's suggested approach."
