## [Answer](../Translation_of_Royal_Titles.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1. English: Your Majesty (This is a direct translation of the title used for kings and queens in many Western cultures, but it is not universal.)

2. Spanish: Su Majestad (Su = His/Her; Majestad = Majesty)

3. French: Sa Majesté (Sa = Her/His; Majesté = Majesty)

4. German: Ihre Majestät (Ihre = Her/His; Majestät = Majesty)

5. Italian: Sua Maestà (Sua = Her/His; Maestà = Majesty)

6. Dutch: Haar Majesteit (Haar = Her; Majesteit = Majesty)

7. Russian: Её Величество (Her Imperial Highness - often used for queens, but a more formal translation would be Его Императорское Величества - His Imperial Majesty, which is used for emperors and kings.)

8. Greek: Η Βασιλεία Σου (The Kingdom of You) - this is an indirect way to address a king or queen in some Greek Orthodox contexts.

9. Hebrew: מלך עולם (King of the World) - this phrase is used for God and can be adapted for human kings as well.

10. Arabic: الملك العزيز (The Noble King) - this is a respectful way to address a king in some Arabic contexts.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a thorough list of translations for "Your Majesty" in different languages, which shows good research effort. However, the concern specified ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes using terms like 'your Highness' or 'your Excellency,' or using a natural way of addressing a ruler in the target language. While the student's translations are accurate, they could have included more context on why certain translations may be more appropriate or respectful in a biblical sense, aligning more closely with the teacher's suggested approach.
