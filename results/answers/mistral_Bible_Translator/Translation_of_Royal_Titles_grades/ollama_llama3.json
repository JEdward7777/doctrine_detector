However, it could be improved by providing more accurate and respectful translations of titles in different languages, as well as considering how these translations might relate to biblical teachings. For example, while the Russian translation \"\u0415\u0451 \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\" is correct, it may not be directly equivalent to \"Your Majesty.\" Additionally, some of the translations provided (e.g., Greek: \u0397 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03a3\u03bf\u03c5) may be more informal or culturally specific, rather than a direct translation. Overall, the response shows an understanding of the complexity of translating titles, but could benefit from more nuanced and accurate examples."
