## [Answer](../Translation_of_Royal_Titles.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1. English: Your Majesty (This is a direct translation of the title used for kings and queens in many Western cultures, but it is not universal.)

2. Spanish: Su Majestad (Su = His/Her; Majestad = Majesty)

3. French: Sa Majesté (Sa = Her/His; Majesté = Majesty)

4. German: Ihre Majestät (Ihre = Her/His; Majestät = Majesty)

5. Italian: Sua Maestà (Sua = Her/His; Maestà = Majesty)

6. Dutch: Haar Majesteit (Haar = Her; Majesteit = Majesty)

7. Russian: Её Величество (Her Imperial Highness - often used for queens, but a more formal translation would be Его Императорское Величества - His Imperial Majesty, which is used for emperors and kings.)

8. Greek: Η Βασιλεία Σου (The Kingdom of You) - this is an indirect way to address a king or queen in some Greek Orthodox contexts.

9. Hebrew: מלך עולם (King of the World) - this phrase is used for God and can be adapted for human kings as well.

10. Arabic: الملك العزيز (The Noble King) - this is a respectful way to address a king in some Arabic contexts.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a good starting point by acknowledging that "Your Majesty" can be translated differently depending on the language and cultural context. However, it could be improved by providing more accurate and respectful translations of titles in different languages, as well as considering how these translations might relate to biblical teachings. For example, while the Russian translation "Её Величество" is correct, it may not be directly equivalent to "Your Majesty." Additionally, some of the translations provided (e.g., Greek: Η Βασιλεία Σου) may be more informal or culturally specific, rather than a direct translation. Overall, the response shows an understanding of the complexity of translating titles, but could benefit from more nuanced and accurate examples.
