However, from a Christian worldview perspective focusing on biblical teachings, it would be important to highlight the significance of addressing rulers with respect and honor, as emphasized in passages like Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:17. The response could have connected the translations more explicitly to the biblical principles of respect for authority."
