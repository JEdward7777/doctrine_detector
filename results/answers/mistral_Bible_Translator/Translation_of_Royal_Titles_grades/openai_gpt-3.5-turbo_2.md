## [Answer](../Translation_of_Royal_Titles.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1. English: Your Majesty (This is a direct translation of the title used for kings and queens in many Western cultures, but it is not universal.)

2. Spanish: Su Majestad (Su = His/Her; Majestad = Majesty)

3. French: Sa Majesté (Sa = Her/His; Majesté = Majesty)

4. German: Ihre Majestät (Ihre = Her/His; Majestät = Majesty)

5. Italian: Sua Maestà (Sua = Her/His; Maestà = Majesty)

6. Dutch: Haar Majesteit (Haar = Her; Majesteit = Majesty)

7. Russian: Её Величество (Her Imperial Highness - often used for queens, but a more formal translation would be Его Императорское Величества - His Imperial Majesty, which is used for emperors and kings.)

8. Greek: Η Βασιλεία Σου (The Kingdom of You) - this is an indirect way to address a king or queen in some Greek Orthodox contexts.

9. Hebrew: מלך עולם (King of the World) - this phrase is used for God and can be adapted for human kings as well.

10. Arabic: الملك العزيز (The Noble King) - this is a respectful way to address a king in some Arabic contexts.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for "Your Majesty" in various languages, which demonstrates a good understanding of linguistic diversity. However, from a Christian worldview perspective focusing on biblical teachings, it would be important to highlight the significance of addressing rulers with respect and honor, as emphasized in passages like Romans 13:1-7 and 1 Peter 2:17. The response could have connected the translations more explicitly to the biblical principles of respect for authority.
