However, the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings is not fully addressed. While the translations provided are respectful in a general sense, they may not align directly with biblical teachings on addressing authority figures. More explicit connections to biblical principles or teachings on respect and honor towards rulers could strengthen the response."
