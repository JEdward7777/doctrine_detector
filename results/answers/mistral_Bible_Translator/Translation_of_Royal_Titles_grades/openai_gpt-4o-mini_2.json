  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"Your Majesty\" in various languages, which demonstrates a good understanding of the task. However, the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings is not fully addressed. While the translations provided are accurate and respectful in general terms, a Christian-specific worldview could have been incorporated to highlight the significance of addressing rulers with humility and reverence, reflecting biblical principles of honoring authority. Integrating this perspective would enhance the response and align it more closely with the concern provided."
