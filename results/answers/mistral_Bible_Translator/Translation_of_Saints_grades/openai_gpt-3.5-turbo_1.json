The suggested translations of \"holy ones,\" \"holy people,\" and \"holy believers in Jesus\" effectively convey the idea of believers set apart for God without specific references to particular Christian groups. However, there could have been a clearer emphasis on avoiding potential exclusivity and ensuring an inclusive representation of all believers in Jesus."
