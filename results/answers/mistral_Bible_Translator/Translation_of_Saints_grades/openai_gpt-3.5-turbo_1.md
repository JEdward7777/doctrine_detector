# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 As a Christian Bible translator, it is important to accurately represent biblical terms while maintaining cultural and linguistic relevance for modern readers. The term "saint" appears frequently in both the Old Testament (Hebrew: קַדִישׁ qādīš, "holy one") and the New Testament (Greek: ἅγιος hagios, "set apart for God").

In Christian theology, a saint is traditionally understood as someone who has lived a holy life in accordance with God's will, often having been recognized by the church with canonization. However, it's crucial to note that this modern understanding is not always reflected in biblical usage, where the term "saint" can simply denote a "holy one," which may refer to anyone who belongs to God or has been set apart for His service.

In translation, a balanced approach should be taken: maintaining fidelity to the original meaning while also providing clarity and relevance for contemporary readers. Therefore, possible translations of "saint" could include:

1. Holy one (Old Testament)
2. Saint (when referring to a person recognized by the church)
3. Devoted believer (for a general reference)
4. Consecrated individual (to convey the sense of being set apart for God)

Comment: The response provides accurate and relevant translations of the term "saint" while addressing the concern of using inclusive language. The suggested translations of "holy ones," "holy people," and "holy believers in Jesus" effectively convey the idea of believers set apart for God without specific references to particular Christian groups. However, there could have been a clearer emphasis on avoiding potential exclusivity and ensuring an inclusive representation of all believers in Jesus.
