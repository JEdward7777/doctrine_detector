  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a thoughtful and nuanced approach to translating the term \"saint\" in a Christian context, considering both the traditional theological understanding and the biblical usage. The suggested translations were appropriate and inclusive, carefully avoiding specific Christian denominational connotations. Maintaining fidelity to the original meaning while ensuring clarity and relevance for modern readers was addressed effectively. The only minor improvement could be providing a slightly broader range of alternative translations, but overall, this response demonstrated a solid understanding of the Christian perspective on translating biblical terms."
