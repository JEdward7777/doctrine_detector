  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the importance of translating the term \"sanctuary\" in modern texts with theological accuracy and cultural sensitivity. They provide practical considerations and guidelines for maintaining the original meaning of the term while being mindful of different cultural interpretations. However, the student could improve by more explicitly emphasizing the Biblical definition of sanctuary as a holy and sacred place, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, the student's response is well-informed and thoughtfully addresses the concern given."
