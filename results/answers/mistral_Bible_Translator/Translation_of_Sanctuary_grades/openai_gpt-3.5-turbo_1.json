  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides thorough guidelines for maintaining theological accuracy and cultural sensitivity in translating the term \"sanctuary\" in modern texts. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the importance of preserving the original meaning of Biblical terms and provides practical steps to achieve this goal. The emphasis on collaboration with other translators and scholars is particularly commendable. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention the importance of consulting the original Biblical languages to ensure accurate translation. Overall, this response aligns well with a Christian worldview in translating Biblical terms accurately."
