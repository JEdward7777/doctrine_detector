  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 90.\n\nThe student demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical context and the Hebrew verb 'qara'. They also provide a variety of alternative translations that maintain the original meaning while offering different nuances. The references to specific Bible verses add credibility to the answer. However, the student could have further explained how these alternative translations might impact theological understanding or application in a biblical context, which would enhance the depth of the response. Overall, the answer is well-researched and offers a thoughtful examination of the phrase."
