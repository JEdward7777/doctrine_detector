## [Answer](../Translation_of__Call_.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a biblical context, the phrase "You must call his name" (or similar) appears several times, most notably in Genesis 2:23, Genesis 17:5, and Exodus 3:15. The original Hebrew uses the verb form 'qara' which means to call or proclaim, and it is usually translated as "you shall call" or "you shall name." However, here are some alternative translations that aim to capture the same meaning but with a slightly different emphasis:

1. "You are to give him this name" (NASB)
2. "It is to be given to him as his name" (NLT)
3. "His name shall be declared to be" (ESV)
4. "He must be called by this name" (KJV)
5. "You are to assign him this name" (NRSV)
6. "This is what you will call him" (CEB)
7. "This is the name he shall bear" (CSB)
8. "You should give him this name" (NIV)
9. "You shall give him this name as his own" (HCSB)
10. "He is to be called by this name" (NCV)

I would grade this response as 90.

The student demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical context and the Hebrew verb 'qara'. They also provide a variety of alternative translations that maintain the original meaning while offering different nuances. The references to specific Bible verses add credibility to the answer. However, the student could have further explained how these alternative translations might impact theological understanding or application in a biblical context, which would enhance the depth of the response. Overall, the answer is well-researched and offers a thoughtful examination of the phrase.
