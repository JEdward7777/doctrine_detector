## [Answer](../Translation_of__Call_.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a biblical context, the phrase "You must call his name" (or similar) appears several times, most notably in Genesis 2:23, Genesis 17:5, and Exodus 3:15. The original Hebrew uses the verb form 'qara' which means to call or proclaim, and it is usually translated as "you shall call" or "you shall name." However, here are some alternative translations that aim to capture the same meaning but with a slightly different emphasis:

1. "You are to give him this name" (NASB)
2. "It is to be given to him as his name" (NLT)
3. "His name shall be declared to be" (ESV)
4. "He must be called by this name" (KJV)
5. "You are to assign him this name" (NRSV)
6. "This is what you will call him" (CEB)
7. "This is the name he shall bear" (CSB)
8. "You should give him this name" (NIV)
9. "You shall give him this name as his own" (HCSB)
10. "He is to be called by this name" (NCV)
