  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the evolution of the translation of \"elect\" in older and modern English Bible versions. The explanation of the theological implications and differences in emphasis between the two types of translations is clear and accurate. The student effectively communicates how the choice of words in the translations can impact one's understanding of Scripture, highlighting the importance of theological perspective in interpretation. The response could have been strengthened by providing more specific verses and examples from both older and modern English versions to support the points made. Overall, an excellent analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
