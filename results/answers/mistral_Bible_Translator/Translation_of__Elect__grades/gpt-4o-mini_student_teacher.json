  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured and informative answer that covers the differences in the translation of 'elect' between older and modern English Bible versions, and how it impacts understanding Scripture in relation to God's choosing of individuals. The response effectively discusses the theological implications and shifts in language usage. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly address the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God, as the response could have tied this concept more explicitly to the translations discussed."
