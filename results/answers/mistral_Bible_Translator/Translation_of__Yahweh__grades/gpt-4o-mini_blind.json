  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: \nThis answer provides a good explanation of the reasons behind using \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in translations, touching on both the Jewish tradition and Christian adoption of this practice. The answer acknowledges the sacredness of God's personal name and the reverence associated with it. The student effectively explains the importance of maintaining respect for God's name while still conveying its meaning accurately in translations. The response could be strengthened by including more scriptural references or examples to support the points made."
