  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of the reasons behind the use of \"LORD\" instead of \"Yahweh\" in Christian translations, highlighting the traditions and reverence associated with the names of God. The response effectively addresses the concern about the importance of using original names versus cultural practices in a Christian context. However, the student could have emphasized more on the significance of maintaining reverence for God's name and the traditional practices within Christian churches, aligning closer to the reference answer provided by the teacher."
