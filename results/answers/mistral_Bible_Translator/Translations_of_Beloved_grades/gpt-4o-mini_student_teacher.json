  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough list of translation suggestions for the term 'beloved' based on the context of love, incorporating various nuances and biblical references. However, while the student's answer is detailed and reflects a good understanding of the concept, some of the suggested translations may be more nuanced or culturally specific than others. The student could further enhance their response by focusing on translations that align more closely with the teacher's reference answer to maintain accuracy in biblical interpretation within the Christian faith."
