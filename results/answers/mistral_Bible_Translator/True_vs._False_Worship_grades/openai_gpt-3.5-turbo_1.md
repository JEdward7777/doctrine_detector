## Question [True vs. False Worship](../../../questions/True_vs._False_Worship.md)
What is a difference between worshiping God and worshiping false gods?

## Correct Answer
Worship involves honoring and obeying Yahweh as the One True God, whereas worshiping false gods includes actions that lead away from serving Him, as exemplified by the Canaanites and the Israelites who strayed from God's commands.

## Stated Concern
Understanding true worship is crucial for Christians to ensure they are directing their honor and service to God alone.

## [Answer](../True_vs._False_Worship.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, worshiping God (monotheism) and worshiping false gods (polytheism or idolatry) are fundamentally different because they involve different objects of devotion and have different effects on one's relationship with the divine.

Worshiping God, as defined in Christianity, involves acknowledging Him as the one true Creator and Sustainer of all things, and submitting oneself to His will, loving Him above all else, and seeking to serve Him faithfully. This includes praying to Him, praising Him, studying about Him, obeying His commands, and living a life that reflects His character.

On the other hand, worshiping false gods or idols involves giving devotion, honor, and obedience to created things, such as images, objects, or powers that are believed to have supernatural powers, rather than to the one true God. This is considered sinful because it violates the first commandment given in Exodus 20:3, "You shall have no other gods before me."

In worshiping false gods, one may miss out on a meaningful relationship with the one true God and risk eternal separation from Him. Instead, by worshiping God alone, Christians can enjoy a fulfilling life and relationship with Him both now and in eternity.
