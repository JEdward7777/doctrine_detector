The explanation is clear and aligns well with the Christian worldview, addressing the concern of ensuring proper worship. The only minor feedback for improvement would be to include a more direct reference to biblical examples of the consequences of straying from true worship, in addition to mentioning the Canaanites and Israelites. Overall, a strong and well-supported response."
