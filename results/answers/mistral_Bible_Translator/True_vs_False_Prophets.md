## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Christian Bible, particularly in Deuteronomy 18:20-22 and Matthew 7:15-23, there are clear guidelines to distinguish between a true prophet of God and a false prophet. Here are some criteria:

1. The message aligns with Scripture: A true prophet will not deviate from what is written in the Bible but will confirm the words of Scripture (Deuteronomy 18:20-22). False prophets, on the other hand, often introduce new teachings that contradict or go beyond what is written in the Bible.

2. The prophet's predictions come true: True prophets have a high degree of accuracy in their predictions (Deuteronomy 18:22). If a supposed prophet's predictions are consistently inaccurate, it may indicate that they are not speaking for God.

3. They call people to repentance and obedience to God: True prophets always point people back to God, calling them to repentance (Amos 3:7) and obedience to His commands (Isaiah 1:10). False prophets often encourage a relaxed attitude toward sin or promote false teachings that do not lead people to God.

4. They do not seek personal gain: True prophets are humble servants of God who do not seek personal fame or financial gain (Ezekiel 2:5; Matthew 10:7-8). False prophets, however, often seek wealth, power, or recognition for themselves.

5. They are in agreement with the apostolic church and its teachings: In the New Testament era, true prophets would align their messages with the teachings of the apostles (Acts 13:1). Any prophet who teaches doctrines contrary to those established by the apostles should be regarded with suspicion.

6. They produce fruit in keeping with righteousness: A true prophet will bear the fruit of righteousness in their life and ministry (Matthew 7:16-20). False prophets may appear religious on the surface, but their lives will not reflect a genuine transformation by the Holy Spirit.

7. They are submitted to church leadership and accountability: True prophets will be accountable to church leaders and submit themselves to the oversight of other believers (1 Corinthians 14:29-33, 1 Thessalonians 5:12-22). False prophets often resist accountability and operate independently of the church.

8. They love God and neighbor: True prophets have a heart for both God and people (Micah 6:8). False prophets may prioritize their own interests over God's or the welfare of others.
