  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the criteria for distinguishing between a true prophet of God and a false prophet based on biblical principles. It successfully references relevant passages from the Bible and presents a coherent and doctrinally sound analysis. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more direct references to specific verses from the New Testament to support each point, as it predominantly relies on Old Testament references. Overall, a strong and well-structured response."
