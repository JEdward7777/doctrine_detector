 According to the Christian Bible, particularly in Deuteronomy 18:20-22 and Matthew 7:15-23, there are clear guidelines to distinguish between a true prophet of God and a false prophet. Here are some criteria:

1. The message aligns with Scripture: A true prophet will not deviate from what is written in the Bible but will confirm the words of Scripture (Deuteronomy 18:20-22). False prophets, on the other hand, often introduce new teachings that contradict or go beyond what is written in the Bible.

2. The prophet's predictions come true: True prophets have a high degree of accuracy in their predictions (Deuteronomy 18:22). If a supposed prophet's predictions are consistently inaccurate, it may indicate that they are not speaking for God.

3. They call people to repentance and obedience to God: True prophets always point people back to God, calling them to repentance (Amos 3:7) and obedience to His commands (Isaiah 1:10). False prophets often encourage a relaxed attitude toward sin or promote false teachings that do not lead people to God.

4. They do not seek personal gain: True prophets are humble servants of God who do not seek personal fame or financial gain (Ezekiel 2:5; Matthew 10:7-8). False prophets, however, often seek wealth, power, or recognition for themselves.

5. They are in agreement with the apostolic church and its teachings: In the New Testament era, true prophets would align their messages with the teachings of the apostles (Acts 13:1). Any prophet who teaches doctrines contrary to those established by the apostles should be regarded with suspicion.

6. They produce fruit in keeping with righteousness: A true prophet will bear the fruit of righteousness in their life and ministry (Matthew 7:16-20). False prophets may appear religious on the surface, but their lives will not reflect a genuine transformation by the Holy Spirit.

7. They are submitted to church leadership and accountability: True prophets will be accountable to church leaders and submit themselves to the oversight of other believers (1 Corinthians 14:29-33, 1 Thessalonians 5:12-22). False prophets often resist accountability and operate independently of the church.

8. They love God and neighbor: True prophets have a heart for both God and people (Micah 6:8). False prophets may prioritize their own interests over God's or the welfare of others.

Grade: 90

Comment: The answer provides a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the criteria for distinguishing between a true prophet of God and a false prophet based on biblical principles. It successfully references relevant passages from the Bible and presents a coherent and doctrinally sound analysis. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include more direct references to specific verses from the New Testament to support each point, as it predominantly relies on Old Testament references. Overall, a strong and well-structured response.
