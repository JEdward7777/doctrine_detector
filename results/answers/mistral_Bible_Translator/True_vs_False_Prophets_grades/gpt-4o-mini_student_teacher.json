  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained answer with multiple criteria from the Christian Bible to distinguish between true prophets of God and false prophets. They demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic and incorporated relevant scriptural references to support their points. However, the student's response could have been more concise and focused on the key aspects mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a solid effort in addressing the concern with a Christian worldview perspective."
