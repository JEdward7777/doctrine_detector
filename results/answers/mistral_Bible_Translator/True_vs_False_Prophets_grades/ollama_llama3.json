  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThis response effectively addresses the concern of being able to discern true prophetic voices from those that mislead or misrepresent God's messages. The criteria listed provide a clear framework for evaluating the authenticity of a prophet's message, aligning with the biblical guidelines provided in Deuteronomy and Matthew. The points made about the importance of the message aligning with Scripture, the prophet's predictions coming true, and the production of fruit in keeping with righteousness are particularly strong.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have been more concise and focused on the main points. Some of the points, such as the prophet's submission to church leadership and accountability, while important, could be condensed or rephrased to make the response feel less lengthy. Additionally, the response does not explicitly state how these criteria can be applied in practice, which might be helpful for readers who are looking for a more concrete approach.\n\nOverall, however, this is a well-written and biblically-grounded response that provides a clear and comprehensive framework for discerning true prophets from false ones."
