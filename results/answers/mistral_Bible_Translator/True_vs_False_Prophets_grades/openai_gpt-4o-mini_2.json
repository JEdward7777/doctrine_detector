It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting key considerations such as alignment with Scripture, teachings, and fruits of ministry. The response could have been slightly improved by explicitly mentioning the importance of accuracy in predictions and accountability to church leadership, but overall it offers a thorough and insightful analysis."
