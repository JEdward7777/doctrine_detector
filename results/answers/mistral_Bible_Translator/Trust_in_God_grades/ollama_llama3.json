  "grade": 92.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 92.\n\nThis response thoroughly addresses the concern of distinguishing between hope as a confident expectation versus wishful thinking, providing five distinct points that highlight the differences between wishing and having hope in God. The writer effectively grounds their discussion in biblical truths (e.g., Hebrews 6:18, Romans 8:28) and provides clear examples to illustrate their points.\n\nThe only area for improvement is a minor one: while the response is well-organized and easy to follow, some of the sentences could be tightened up for better clarity. For example, the first sentence of point 2 (\"Wishing can be for anything, often material things or personal outcomes\") could be rephrased for more concision.\n\nOverall, this response provides a strong and thoughtful exploration of the difference between wishing and having hope in God, making it an excellent answer to the given concern."
