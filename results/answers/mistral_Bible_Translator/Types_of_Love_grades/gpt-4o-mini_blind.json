It is commendable that the student emphasizes the importance of expressing romantic love within the boundaries of a faithful marriage. However, the response could be strengthened by incorporating more direct scriptural references to support the points made about brotherly and romantic love. Additional references from the Bible would further enhance the biblical foundation of the argument."
