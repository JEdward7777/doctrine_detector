  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of different forms of love in the biblical context, aligning them with the concept of divine love (Agape). The student effectively differentiates between brotherly love (Philia) and romantic love (Eros) while emphasizing the importance of selflessness and commitment in these relationships. The student correctly highlights the need for all forms of love to reflect God's love for humanity. The only slight deviation from the reference answer is the additional theological depth provided by the student, which is commendable but not explicitly required in the question. Overall, a solid understanding and application of biblical principles of love."
