## [Answer](../Types_of_Love.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the Greek word "Agape" is often used to describe a selfless, unconditional, and profound love. This divine love, which God shows towards humanity, is the foundation for all forms of love in Christian theology.

Brotherly love, or Philia in Greek, refers to affectionate friendship and deep regard for another person, usually within the same faith community or family. It emphasizes mutual respect, kindness, and a desire for the well-being of one another. This form of love aligns with Agape, as it is selfless and compassionate.

Romantic love, or Eros in Greek, is typically associated with physical attraction and passion. While the Bible does not explicitly condemn romantic love, it encourages that this affection should be expressed within the context of a faithful, lifelong marriage between a man and a woman (Matthew 19:4-6). The biblical ideal is for romantic love to embody elements of Agape, such as selflessness, patience, and commitment.

Ultimately, all forms of love in the Bible should reflect God's love for humanity, demonstrating selfless devotion and compassion towards others.
