## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Book of Revelation, the term "antichrist" (antíchristos) does not refer to a single identifiable individual but rather symbolizes a spirit or system that opposes Christ and His teachings. The term appears three times in 1 John 2:18-22 and 4:3, where it is described as denying Jesus Christ came in the flesh, leading many astray, and not acknowledging the Father and the Son.

In Revelation 13, there are two figures often associated with the antichrist symbolism: the Beast from the Sea (Revelation 13:1-10) and the Beast from the Earth (Revelation 13:11-18). The Beast from the Sea is often understood to be a political power, while the Beast from the Earth represents religious deception. However, it's essential to remember that these are symbolic representations of power systems and not specific individuals in the literal sense. Interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations.
