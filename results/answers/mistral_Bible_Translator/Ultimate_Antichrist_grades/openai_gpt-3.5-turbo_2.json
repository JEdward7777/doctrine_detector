The reference to the Beasts from the Sea and the Earth further demonstrates an understanding of the apocalyptic imagery in Revelation. The connection to eschatological figures in the concern is relevant and highlights the importance of understanding these concepts for spiritual readiness. Overall, a well-informed and thoughtful response."
