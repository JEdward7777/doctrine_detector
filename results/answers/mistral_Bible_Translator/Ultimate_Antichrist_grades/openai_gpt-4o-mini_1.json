The explanation of the figures in Revelation 13, particularly the Beast from the Sea and the Beast from the Earth, shows a good grasp of the interpretative nuances within Christian eschatology. However, there could have been a deeper exploration of how awareness of these eschatological figures can indeed help Christians prepare for challenges in their faith, perhaps by providing examples or practical insights."
