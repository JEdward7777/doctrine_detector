The understanding of the Beast in Revelation 13 as the ultimate antichrist is appropriate within a Christian worldview. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting how being aware of eschatological figures can help Christians prepare for challenges in faith. The only minor improvement would be to connect the idea of preparation for challenges in faith explicitly to the interpretation of the antichrist figures."
