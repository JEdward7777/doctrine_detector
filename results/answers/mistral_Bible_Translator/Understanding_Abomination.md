## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
1. Worshiping idols (Exodus 20:4-5, Deuteronomy 5:8-9): The Bible clearly states that it is an abomination to God for people to make images of anything in heaven or on earth and worship them instead of the true God.

2. Practice of homosexuality (Leviticus 18:22, 20:13): The Bible identifies homosexual acts as "detestable" or an abomination among the Israelites. However, it's important to note that this passage is often debated in contemporary discussions on human sexuality and same-sex relationships.

3. Offering unclean animals as sacrifices (Leviticus 17:8): In the Old Testament, God explicitly forbade the offering of certain animals, such as swine, camels, and hyenas, as sacrifices because they were considered unclean.

4. Sorcery, witchcraft, and divination (Exodus 22:18, Deuteronomy 18:10-12): The Bible considers these practices to be abhorrent to God, warning against participating in them or consulting those who engage in such activities.

5. Eating blood (Leviticus 3:17, 17:10-14): In the Old Testament, the consumption of blood was considered an abomination because it represents life and belongs to God alone.

6. Lying or bearing false witness (Exodus 20:16, Proverbs 12:22): The Bible consistently condemns lying, deception, and dishonesty as being contrary to the character of God.

7. Oppressing the alien, the fatherless, and the widow (Exodus 22:20-23, Deuteronomy 14:29): The Bible commands believers to show compassion and justice to vulnerable members of society, and failing to do so is an abomination.

8. Taking advantage of the poor or needy (Proverbs 22:22-23, James 5:4): The Bible condemns exploitation and unjust treatment of the disadvantaged as a rejection of God's care for them.
