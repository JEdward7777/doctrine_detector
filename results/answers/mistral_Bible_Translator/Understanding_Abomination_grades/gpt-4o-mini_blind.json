  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and accurate list of actions or practices that the Bible identifies as abominations to God. The references to relevant biblical passages support the points made. However, it would have been beneficial for the student to include a note about the importance of understanding the cultural and historical contexts of these passages when discussing their contemporary relevance. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
