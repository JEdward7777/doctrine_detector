  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of actions that the Bible identifies as abominations to God, showing a good understanding of the importance for Christians to know what goes against God's will as outlined in scripture. The student's answers align well with the reference answer provided by the teacher, demonstrating a solid grasp of Christian teachings on abominable actions. The slight deviation in including sorcery, witchcraft, and divination as abominations, and not including pride and sacrificing humans, led to a very high score but not a perfect score."
