# Question [Understanding Adoption in Christ](../../../questions/Understanding_Adoption_in_Christ.md)
What does it mean to be adopted as a child of God according to Ephesians 1:5?

# Correct Answer
To be adopted as a child of God means that believers are granted the privilege of becoming part of God's family, receiving the same rights and status as biological children, which includes being co-heirs with Christ.

# Stated Concern
Understanding the spiritual significance of adoption in the Christian faith.

# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to Ephesians 1:5, being adopted as a child of God refers to the spiritual act by which individuals who were once far off and strangers to God's family (Ephesians 2:12) are brought near through faith in Jesus Christ. The phrase "adopted" is not used literally but is metaphorical, symbolizing the privileges and protection that come with being a child of a loving Father.

Through adoption, we gain an inheritance (Ephesians 1:14), meaning that we receive all spiritual blessings promised to God's people in Christ. These blessings include salvation, forgiveness, the Holy Spirit, and eternal life. We also have access to God's presence and grace and are part of God's family for all eternity (Ephesians 1:3, 18-20).

In this sense, being adopted as a child of God is more than just a formal designation; it represents the deep, intimate relationship that believers share with their heavenly Father through faith in Jesus Christ. This adoption is a result of God's sovereign choice and love for humanity (Ephesians 1:4-5), rather than any merit or worthiness on our part.
