  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response citing various relevant scriptures from both the Old and New Testaments. They effectively highlighted the severity of adultery and its consequences on marriage and spirituality. The inclusion of verses from Proverbs, Hosea, and references to the universal need for forgiveness through Jesus Christ added depth to the answer. The only suggestion for improvement would be to directly reference Exodus 20:14 and Revelation 2:22 as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer for a more precise alignment with the given concern."
