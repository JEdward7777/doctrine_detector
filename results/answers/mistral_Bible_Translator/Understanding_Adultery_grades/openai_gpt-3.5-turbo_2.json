It effectively uses relevant biblical references to support the points made, demonstrating a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on adultery. A minor improvement could be to elaborate further on the specific spiritual and relational consequences of adultery mentioned in Exodus 20:14 and Revelation 2:22."
