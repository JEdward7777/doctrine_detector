## [Answer](../Understanding_Adultery.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, adultery is considered a grave sin and its consequences are significant both in this life and in the afterlife.

In the Old Testament, Leviticus 20:10 states, "If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife—with the wife of his neighbor—both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death." This law was given to the Israelites as part of God's laws for living in community.

In the New Testament, Jesus reinforces the severity of adultery when He says in Matthew 5:27-28, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."

Regarding the consequences of committing adultery, Proverbs 6:32-33 warns, "The one who commits adultery lacks sense; whoever does so destroys himself. Blasphemes one's own bed; blasphemes one's own body."

In the book of Hosea, God compares Israel's unfaithfulness to Him as spiritual adultery, and warns of divine judgment (Hosea 2:4-5).

The Bible also teaches that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23), and that forgiveness is available through faith in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 1:7, Romans 8:1). So while the consequences of adultery are severe, there is hope for repentance and restoration through Christ.
