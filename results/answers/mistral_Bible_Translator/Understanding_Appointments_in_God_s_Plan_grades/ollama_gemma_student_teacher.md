## [Answer](../Understanding_Appointments_in_God_s_Plan.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a Christian context, being "appointed to eternal life" refers to the spiritual state of being granted salvation and eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ. This concept is rooted in John 3:16 and 5:24, where it is stated that "whoever believes in Him (Jesus) should not perish but have eternal life."

Eternal life is a gift from God that comes by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. It is not something earned or deserved by human effort. This spiritual life begins at the moment of salvation and continues throughout one's earthly life, culminating in a future resurrection and everlasting life with God in heaven.

Being appointed to eternal life means that God has chosen us, and we have chosen Him, for this eternal relationship based on His love and mercy. It is a state of reconciliation, redemption, and eternal fellowship with God, secured by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.

This eternal life offers hope beyond the limits of earthly existence, providing assurance that our salvation is secure, and we will spend eternity in God's presence. It is a fundamental Christian belief that sets apart those who have faith in Jesus as their Savior from those who do not believe.
