  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 95.\n\nThe response accurately reflects the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" as a divine selection and gift from God, rooted in the Bible (John 3:16 and 5:24). The explanation clearly conveys the idea that this appointment is based on God's sovereign will and grace. The response also effectively communicates the significance of this appointment, highlighting its connection to salvation, reconciliation, redemption, and eternal fellowship with God.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to provide more depth and elaboration on the concept of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation, perhaps incorporating additional biblical examples or theological insights. Nevertheless, the response provides a clear and concise understanding of being \"appointed to eternal life,\" effectively addressing the concern of clarifying the concept of divine selection and grace in the context of salvation.\n\nComment: Well-written and well-structured response that accurately reflects the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" and its connection to divine selection, salvation, and eternal life. The response could benefit from more depth and elaboration on the theological aspects, but overall, it provides a clear and concise understanding of this important Christian doctrine."
