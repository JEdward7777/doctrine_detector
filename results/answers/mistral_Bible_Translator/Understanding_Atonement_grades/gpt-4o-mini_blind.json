The student effectively references relevant Bible verses and articulates key theological concepts such as reconciliation, propitiation, and the satisfaction of God's justice through Christ's sacrifice. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the doctrinal significance of Christ's atonement in Christianity. Great job!"
