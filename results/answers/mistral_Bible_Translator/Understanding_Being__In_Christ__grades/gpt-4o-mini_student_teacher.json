They effectively detailed the aspect of justification by faith, union with Christ, participation in Christ's life, membership in the Body of Christ, and the future hope that believers have. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the essential aspect of having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ through faith, which is the core of being \"in Christ\" according to the Christian worldview."
