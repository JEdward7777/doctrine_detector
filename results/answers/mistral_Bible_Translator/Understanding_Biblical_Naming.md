## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, naming often carries significant meaning and reflects an individual's identity, character, or role. In the case of John, his name has both Hebrew (Yochanan) and Greek (Ioannes) origins. The Hebrew form, Yochanan, means "God is gracious" or "God has shown favor." The Greek form, Ioannes, is a translation of the Hebrew name and also means "God is gracious" or "God shows favor."

When the Bible states "His name is called John," it literally signifies that his parents have given him this specific name, but it can also be interpreted as symbolizing John's role and mission in God's plan. For example, John the Baptist is known for preparing the way for Jesus Christ and announcing His coming (Matthew 3:1-3). As a result, his name serves as a testament to his gracious role in fulfilling prophecy and ushering in salvation history.

In addition, John's name is shared by several significant figures in the Bible, such as John the Apostle (also called John the Beloved), who plays a crucial role in recording Jesus' teachings and leading the early Christian community after Jesus' death and resurrection. Each of these individuals embodies God's grace and favor in their own unique way, reflecting the rich symbolism found in biblical naming.
