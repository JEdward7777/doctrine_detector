  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the implications of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob according to Biblical accounts. The student effectively outlines the consequences for both Esau and Jacob, tying it back to the broader themes of spiritual inheritance and consequences of deceit. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a good understanding of the story. However, the response could have benefited from further exploration of the spiritual significance of the birthright in the context of God's covenant with Abraham's descendants. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the theological implications of the story could have enriched the response further."
