  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does address the significance of choices and their spiritual consequences, which aligns with the concern provided. It also accurately summarizes the biblical account of Esau's decision to sell his birthright to Jacob. The discussion of the implications for both brothers is well-organized and easy to follow.\n\nHowever, I deduct 20 points because the response does not fully develop the spiritual significance of Esau's choice within a Christian context. While it mentions the \"honor associated with being the firstborn,\" it could have explored this further in terms of its biblical significance (e.g., Romans 8:17-18) and implications for Esau's faith journey.\n\nTo earn a higher grade, I would suggest adding more depth to the analysis by exploring how Esau's choice relates to biblical teachings on spiritual inheritance, identity, or the consequences of disobedience."
