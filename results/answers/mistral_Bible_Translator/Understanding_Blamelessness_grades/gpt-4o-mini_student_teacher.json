  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer supported by relevant biblical references explaining that being blameless before God is about faith in Jesus Christ and striving to align one's life with His teachings. They accurately highlighted the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly mentioning the aspect of obedience and honoring God, as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
