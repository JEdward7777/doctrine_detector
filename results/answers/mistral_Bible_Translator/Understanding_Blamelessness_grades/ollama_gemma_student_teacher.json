  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 90/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of being blameless before God according to the biblical references. The student clearly articulates the idea that being blameless is not about achieving moral perfection through human effort, but rather trusting in Jesus Christ and living a life that reflects His love. The student also provides relevant biblical passages to support their claims. The clarity and depth of the student's response justifies a high grade."
