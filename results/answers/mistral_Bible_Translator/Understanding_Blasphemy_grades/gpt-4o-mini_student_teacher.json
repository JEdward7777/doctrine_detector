  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the biblical implications of speaking against God or others, supported by relevant passages. The definition of blasphemy provided by the student aligns with the Christian worldview, emphasizing disrespect towards God. However, the student could have further emphasized the aspect of deep disrespect and slander towards God or people, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a well-reasoned response with room for slight improvement in alignment with the reference answer."
