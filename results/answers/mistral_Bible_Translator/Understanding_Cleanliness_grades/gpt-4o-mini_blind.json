They accurately reference key biblical passages and articulate the importance of internal purity over external observances. The response could be strengthened by delving deeper into how the Old Testament regulations on cleanliness connect to moral purity in the New Testament era through the lens of Jesus' teachings. Additionally, more explicit references to the atoning work of Christ and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in enabling believers to live in moral purity would further enhance the explanation."
