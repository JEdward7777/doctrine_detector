  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer that effectively connects the Biblical concepts of 'clean' and 'unclean' to moral purity within a Christian context. They accurately referenced relevant Bible verses and demonstrated an understanding of how these concepts go beyond mere physical cleanliness to spiritual purity. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly acknowledge the symbolism of cleanliness in moral purity earlier in the response."
