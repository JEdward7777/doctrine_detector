  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by exploring the significance of cleanliness in a spiritual context. It begins by highlighting the primary use of \"clean\" and \"unclean\" terms in the Old Testament, then moves to demonstrate how these concepts can be metaphorically applied to moral purity within a Christian context. The inclusion of specific biblical passages (Leviticus 11:44-45, Matthew 15:10-20) and references to Christian teachings (Colossians 3:12-17) also strengthen the response.\n\nHowever, the response could have gone further in exploring the symbolic connections between physical cleanliness and spiritual purity. While it mentions that \"true righteousness comes from the heart,\" it does not explicitly illustrate how this connection can guide believers' personal and communal lives. A more explicit application of these concepts to daily life would have elevated the grade.\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical context surrounding \"clean\" and \"unclean\" terms, but could benefit from more direct connections to spiritual purity and practical applications in daily life."
