  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of 1 John 3:20 and Romans 5:16, highlighting the perspectives on condemnation within the Christian faith. The student accurately discussed the internal conviction and eternal condemnation aspects, as well as the contrast between condemnation and grace through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the answer could have been improved by directly connecting the biblical teaching with the contrast between condemnation and grace in the Christian life, as emphasized in the teacher's reference answer."
