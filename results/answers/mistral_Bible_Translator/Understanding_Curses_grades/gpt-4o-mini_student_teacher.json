  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer supported by various Bible verses that emphasize the consequences of cursing others and the importance of speaking blessings instead. The student effectively connected the concept of cursing with broader biblical teachings on love, kindness, and the potential negative outcomes of sowing anger. However, the student could have focused more specifically on the direct implications of cursing highlighted in James 3:10, aligning more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a solid effort demonstrating a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
