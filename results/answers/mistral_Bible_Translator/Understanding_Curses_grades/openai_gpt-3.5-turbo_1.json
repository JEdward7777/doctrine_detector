It effectively integrates relevant scripture passages and conveys a clear understanding of the implications of our words. The only minor improvement could have been to provide a more explicit connection to Jesus' teachings on the seriousness of anger and cursing, but overall, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of the concern presented."
