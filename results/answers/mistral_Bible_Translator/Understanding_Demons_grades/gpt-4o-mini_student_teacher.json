  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid understanding of the term \"unclean spirit\" in relation to demons as described in Christian teachings. They accurately explain that unclean spirits are considered evil and opposed to God, causing harm and possessing individuals. They also mention the biblical basis for this concept. The student effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the nature and characteristics of demons and their influence on individuals. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the spiritual battle aspect of demons opposing God's will. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
