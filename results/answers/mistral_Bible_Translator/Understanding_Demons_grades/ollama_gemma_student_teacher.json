  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of \"unclean spirit\" in Christian teachings. It accurately explains that the term is often used interchangeably with \"demon,\" and provides a concise definition of demons as supernatural beings opposed to God. The inclusion of references to biblical accounts and Christian theology adds credibility to the response. However, the student could improve their grade by providing more detail on the specific actions or characteristics associated with unclean spirits in Christian beliefs."
