## Question [Understanding Divine Judgment](../../../questions/Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md)
What does the Bible say about Godâ€™s judgment and how does it differ from human judgment?

## Correct Answer
The Bible teaches that God's judgment is based on His perfect righteousness and justice, while human judgment can be flawed and biased. God's judgment is often a response to sin, and it includes both punishment and a call to repentance.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Judgment.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible speaks extensively about God's judgment and distinguishes it clearly from human judgment. Here are some key points that highlight the differences:

1. Source of Authority: Human judgments are based on human laws, experiences, and imperfect understanding (James 2:13). In contrast, God's judgment is rooted in His perfect wisdom, justice, and righteousness (Psalm 96:13; Proverbs 2:6).

2. Basis for Judgment: Human judgments often focus on outward actions or appearances, whereas God's judgment examines the heart (1 Samuel 16:7; Proverbs 21:2). God sees what is done in secret and rewards accordingly (Matthew 6:3-4, 18:35).

3. Scope of Judgment: Human judgments are typically limited to specific situations or individuals, while God's judgment encompasses all people and their actions throughout their lives (Hebrews 9:27).

4. Justness of Judgment: God is perfectly just, and His judgments are always fair and consistent with His nature (Deuteronomy 32:4; Revelation 16:7). In contrast, human judgments can be swayed by prejudice, bias, or personal interests (James 2:1-4).

5. Timing of Judgment: Human judgment is often immediate or soon after an event, while God's timing for judgment may not always be apparent to us and sometimes occurs at the end of one's life or at the final judgment (Romans 2:6; Revelation 20:11-15).

6. Mercy in Judgment: God is both just and merciful, and His judgments are balanced with mercy for those who repent and turn to Him (Exodus 34:6-7; Luke 18:13). Human judgment often lacks this capacity for compassion and forgiveness.

In summary, the Bible teaches that God's judgment is based on perfect wisdom, fairness, and righteousness, examines the heart, encompasses all actions in a person's life, and may occur at any time or after death. Human judgments are limited, often biased, and focused on outward appearances.
