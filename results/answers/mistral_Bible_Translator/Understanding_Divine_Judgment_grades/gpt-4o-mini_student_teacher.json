  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-structured answer that effectively highlights the differences between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment. The response is thorough in explaining key points such as the source of authority, basis for judgment, scope of judgment, justness of judgment, timing of judgment, and mercy in judgment. However, a slight deduction in points is warranted as the student's explanation could have been more concise and focused on the core elements of God's judgment compared to human judgment, as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
