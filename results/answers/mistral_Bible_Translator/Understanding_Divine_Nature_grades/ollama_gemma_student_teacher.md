 In Christian theology, the term "divine nature" refers to the essential attributes and characteristics that make God distinctively God. This includes His omnipotence (all-powerfulness), omniscience (all-knowingness), omnipresence (being present everywhere), eternity (without beginning or end), perfection, holiness, love, and many other traits as described in the Bible. It is important to note that God's divine nature transcends human understanding and is beyond full comprehension. The term emphasizes that God is not merely a being with exceptional qualities but one who possesses an inherent, unique essence that defines Deity.
