  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical teachings regarding eternal life. They effectively analyzed relevant passages from the Old and New Testaments to support their claims. The response clearly explains that eternal life is a gift from God, given through faith in Jesus Christ, and emphasizes that salvation is not earned or deserved but is freely received through faith. However, the answer could benefit from acknowledging the concern about inheriting eternal life in the context of Christian faith, as the reference answer suggests."
