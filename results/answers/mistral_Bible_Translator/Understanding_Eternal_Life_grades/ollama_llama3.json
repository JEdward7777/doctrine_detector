  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response accurately reflects Christian theology's view that eternal life is a gift from God, given through faith in Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 2:10). The provided verses from John, Romans, and Titus support this doctrine and emphasize the free nature of salvation. The summary correctly explains that eternal life is not earned or deserved but is instead received through faith.\n\nThe main concern is well-addressed, as the response focuses on the importance of understanding how to attain eternal life for spiritual assurance. However, there are a few areas where improvement could be made:\n\n1. Although the response does mention Jesus Christ, it would benefit from more explicit emphasis on His person and work in relation to eternal life. For example, mentioning His sacrifice, resurrection, or role as mediator.\n2. While the provided verses support the doctrine of salvation by faith, additional passages could strengthen this argument. This could include references to other biblical characters, events, or themes that illustrate the importance of faith for eternal life.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of Christian theology regarding eternal life and its attainment through faith in Jesus Christ."
