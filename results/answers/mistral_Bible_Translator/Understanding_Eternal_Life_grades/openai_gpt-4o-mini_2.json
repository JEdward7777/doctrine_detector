This contradicts Christian theology, which teaches that eternal life is a gift from God through faith in Jesus Christ, not through human actions or obedience to laws. The response lacks a foundational understanding of Christian doctrine on salvation and eternal life, which is a crucial aspect of the Christian faith. It is important to have a correct understanding of these principles for spiritual assurance and alignment with Christian beliefs."
