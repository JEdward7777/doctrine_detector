  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation differentiating between \"evil\" and \"wickedness\" in terms of moral character and behavior according to a biblical perspective. The student effectively captures the nuanced distinctions in usage between the two terms, backed up with relevant biblical references. The explanation is clear and demonstrates an understanding of the underlying principles and implications of these concepts in the context of Scripture. However, to enhance the response, more explicit connections to the overall biblical narrative and the implications of 'evil' and 'wickedness' on one's relationship with God could be included."
