  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer that effectively distinguishes between \"evil\" and \"wickedness\" in terms of moral character and behavior according to biblical teachings. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the distinction and effectively applies biblical references to support the explanation. The student's analysis is thorough and aligns well with the Christian worldview, highlighting the importance of reflecting on both character and actions in light of biblical principles. Great job!"
