# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of Christianity, as provided by the New Testament in the Bible, having faith in Jesus means trusting and believing in Him as the Son of God, the savior of humanity, and the fulfillment of God's promise. This belief is rooted in understanding His life, teachings, death, and resurrection.

Faith in Jesus includes accepting Him as Lord (acknowledging His authority) and Savior (believing that He paid the penalty for our sins on the cross). It involves trusting in Him for salvation and living a life aligned with His teachings. The ultimate demonstration of faith is expressed through love for God and others, obedience to God's commands, and sharing the message of Jesus with others.

This faith is not based on human efforts or works but on God's grace (unmerited favor) received by faith alone (Ephesians 2:8-9). It is a relationship with God through Jesus Christ that provides forgiveness of sins and eternal life.

In summary, having faith in Jesus means trusting Him as the way to know God personally, to be reconciled to God, and to receive the gift of eternal life.
