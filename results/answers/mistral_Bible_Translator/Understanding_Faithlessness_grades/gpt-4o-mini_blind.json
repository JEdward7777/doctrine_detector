  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a solid understanding of the term \"faithless\" within Christian theology. The student effectively explains the implications of lacking faith in God, supported by relevant biblical references. The acknowledgment of human fallibility and the emphasis on repentance and God's grace align well with Christian doctrine. Overall, this is a well-rounded and doctrinally sound explanation."
