  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a good understanding of the term \"faithless\" in the context of Christian theology, linking it to a lack of faith in God. They also correctly mentioned the importance of repentance, growth, and God's grace in the face of faithlessness. However, the student could improve their response by explicitly connecting faithlessness to its implications on moral conduct, as per the concern provided."
