  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Christian perspective on faith and its relationship to morality. The response clearly explains the theological meaning of \"faithless\" as a lack of belief or trust in God, citing relevant scripture. Additionally, the student acknowledges the possibility of human shortcomings and the need for repentance while emphasizing God's forgiveness and mercy. While the response lacks some elaboration on the practical implications of faith on moral conduct, its overall clarity and theological accuracy merit a high grade."
