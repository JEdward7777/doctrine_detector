## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, the concept of "fear" differs significantly from its common understanding in daily life. While we often associate fear with anxiety or dread about potential harm or danger, biblical fear carries a broader and deeper meaning.

Biblical fear can be understood as reverence, awe, or respect for God. This type of fear is not based on intimidation but rather on recognition of the greatness, holiness, and sovereignty of God. It involves humbling oneself before Him and obeying His commands out of love and devotion.

For example, in Matthew 10:28, Jesus says, "And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell." Here, the fear being discussed is not a general anxiety about danger, but rather a healthy respect for God's power and authority.

In contrast, Proverbs 19:23 says, "The fear of the LORD leads to life, and whoever has it rests satisfied; he will not be visited by harm." This verse illustrates the positive, life-giving aspect of biblical fear, where submission to God's will brings peace and contentment.

In daily life, it is important to understand that biblical fear is not about being constantly anxious or scared but rather maintaining a proper perspective of who God is and living our lives in accordance with His will out of love and reverence for Him.
