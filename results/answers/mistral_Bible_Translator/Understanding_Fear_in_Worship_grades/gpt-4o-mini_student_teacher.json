They effectively highlighted the aspects of reverence, awe, and respect towards God, in contrast to mere anxiety or dread. The use of relevant biblical references further supports their explanation. The student's response aligns closely with the reference answer, showing a strong grasp of the Christian worldview on biblical fear."
