They have correctly highlighted that fools despise wisdom and instruction, lack the fear of the Lord, exhibit anxiety instead of faith, and are characterized by evil, pride, and foolishness. The answer could have been strengthened by incorporating additional scripture references from other parts of the Bible to offer a more comprehensive understanding of what constitutes foolishness in the sight of God."
