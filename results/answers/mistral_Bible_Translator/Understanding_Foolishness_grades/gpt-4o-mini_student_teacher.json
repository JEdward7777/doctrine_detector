  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of how a fool is defined in relation to belief and obedience to God according to the Bible. They referenced relevant passages from Proverbs to support their points. However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly stating that a fool is someone who does not believe in God and disobeys Him, as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, a solid understanding demonstrated."
