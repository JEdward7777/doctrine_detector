## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian teaching, forgiveness is an act of grace, mercy, and love demonstrated by an individual towards someone who has wronged them. It involves releasing anger, resentment, and the desire for retribution against the person who has offended them. The Bible teaches that forgiveness is a fundamental aspect of the Christian faith and is essential for maintaining a right relationship with God and others (Matthew 6:14-15, Matthew 18:21-35, Ephesians 4:32).

The act of forgiveness reflects God's character as He is merciful and forgiving towards those who repent and turn away from their sins (Exodus 34:6-7, Colossians 3:13). Christians are called to follow God's example by extending forgiveness to others just as they have been forgiven by Him. In Matthew 18:21-22, Peter asks Jesus how many times a person should forgive their brother when he sins against them. In response, Jesus tells the parable of the unmerciful servant, who is forgiven a large debt by his master but then refuses to forgive a small debt owed to him by a fellow servant. Jesus teaches that individuals should forgive others not just seven times, but seventy-seven times (Matthew 18:21-22).

In summary, forgiveness in the Christian context means letting go of resentment and anger towards those who have wronged us, extending grace and mercy as a reflection of God's character, and following His command to forgive others as we have been forgiven.
