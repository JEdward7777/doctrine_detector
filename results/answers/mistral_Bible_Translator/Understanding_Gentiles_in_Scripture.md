## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, the Israelites perceived Gentiles (non-Israelites) as being outside the covenant relationship God had established with them. This perspective is reflected in several passages, such as Deuteronomy 7:1-6 and Leviticus 19:34. However, it's important to note that while there was a clear distinction between Israelites and Gentiles, there were also instances of interaction, cooperation, and even respect for certain foreign nations in the Old Testament.

In the New Testament, with the coming of Jesus Christ, the message of salvation expanded beyond the Jewish community to include all nations (Acts 1:8). This shift is evident in the early church's interactions with Gentiles. The apostle Paul played a significant role in this transformation. He was called by God to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles (Acts 9:15-16, Galatians 2:7-9), and his missionary journeys resulted in the establishment of several Gentile churches (Acts 13-28).

Despite this openness to Gentiles, there were still tensions and debates within the early church about whether Gentile converts needed to follow Jewish customs such as circumcision and dietary laws. These issues were addressed at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, where it was decided that while Gentile believers should abstain from certain practices that violated their consciences, they were not required to follow Jewish customs.

In summary, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles evolved significantly in the early church. While there was initially a clear distinction between the two groups, the advent of Christ and the preaching of the Gospel led to a broader understanding that salvation was available to all nations. However, tensions and debates persisted, particularly regarding the cultural practices of new Gentile converts.
