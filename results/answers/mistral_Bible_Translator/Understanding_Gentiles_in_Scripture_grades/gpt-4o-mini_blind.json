  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The student provided a solid explanation of the evolution of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles in the early church, supported by relevant Old and New Testament references. They accurately highlighted the shift towards inclusivity in the Gospel message and the role of figures like the apostle Paul. The student could further strengthen their answer by delving deeper into the theological implications of this shift, such as the fulfillment of God's promise to bless all nations through Abraham (Genesis 12:3) and the theological significance of the Council of Jerusalem's decision. Overall, a well-written response demonstrating a good understanding of the topic."
