They effectively highlighted key biblical references and the role of figures like the apostle Paul in bridging the gap between Jewish and Gentile believers. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern about the implications for the church's unity resulting from these historical dynamics. This would strengthen the connection between the discussion of perceptions and their impact on relationships within the early church."
