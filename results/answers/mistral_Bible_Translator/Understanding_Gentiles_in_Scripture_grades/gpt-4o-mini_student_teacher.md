## Question [Understanding Gentiles in Scripture](../../../questions/Understanding_Gentiles_in_Scripture.md)
How did the Israelites' perception of Gentiles affect their relationships with them in the early church?

## Correct Answer
The Israelites traditionally viewed Gentiles as outsiders who could never be God's people, which led to challenges in relationship and fellowship within the early church as these barriers were being broken down.

## Stated Concern
This question addresses the historical context of Jewish-Gentile relationships and their implications for the church's unity.

 In the Old Testament, the Israelites perceived Gentiles (non-Israelites) as being outside the covenant relationship God had established with them. This perspective is reflected in several passages, such as Deuteronomy 7:1-6 and Leviticus 19:34. However, it's important to note that while there was a clear distinction between Israelites and Gentiles, there were also instances of interaction, cooperation, and even respect for certain foreign nations in the Old Testament.

In the New Testament, with the coming of Jesus Christ, the message of salvation expanded beyond the Jewish community to include all nations (Acts 1:8). This shift is evident in the early church's interactions with Gentiles. The apostle Paul played a significant role in this transformation. He was called by God to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles (Acts 9:15-16, Galatians 2:7-9), and his missionary journeys resulted in the establishment of several Gentile churches (Acts 13-28).

Despite this openness to Gentiles, there were still tensions and debates within the early church about whether Gentile converts needed to follow Jewish customs such as circumcision and dietary laws. These issues were addressed at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, where it was decided that while Gentile believers should abstain from certain practices that violated their consciences, they were not required to follow Jewish customs.

In summary, the Israelites' perception of Gentiles evolved significantly in the early church. While there was initially a clear distinction between the two groups, the advent of Christ and the preaching of the Gospel led to a broader understanding that salvation was available to all nations. However, tensions and debates persisted, particularly regarding the cultural practices of new Gentile converts.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a well-detailed and comprehensive answer that accurately discussed the evolution of the Israelites' perception of Gentiles in the early church. They effectively highlighted key biblical references and the role of figures like the apostle Paul in bridging the gap between Jewish and Gentile believers. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern about the implications for the church's unity resulting from these historical dynamics. This would strengthen the connection between the discussion of perceptions and their impact on relationships within the early church.
