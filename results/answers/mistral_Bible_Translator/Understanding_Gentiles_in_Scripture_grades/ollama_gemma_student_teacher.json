  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the historical context and theological developments related to the Israelites' perception of Gentiles in the early church. It provides relevant scriptural references and explains the shift in perspective with the advent of Jesus Christ. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the social and cultural factors that influenced the Israelites' perceptions of Gentiles. Additionally, the student's conclusion concisely summarizes the key points but could be strengthened by emphasizing the significance of the Council of Jerusalem in resolving the tensions over cultural practices."
