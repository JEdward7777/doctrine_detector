The explanation is well-supported with relevant scriptural references and demonstrates an understanding of how the perception of Gentiles shifted with the expansion of salvation to all nations through Jesus Christ. Additionally, the response acknowledges the tensions and debates that arose within the early church regarding the inclusion of Gentiles and the need for cultural sensitivity. Overall, this is a well-rounded and coherent response that effectively addresses the given concern from a Christian worldview."
