It effectively addresses the concern about the implications of these relationships for the church's unity, acknowledging the challenges and debates that arose but also emphasizing the broader understanding of salvation for all nations. The only minor improvement could be further emphasizing the role of God's sovereignty in orchestrating this shift and the importance of unity in Christ despite cultural differences."
