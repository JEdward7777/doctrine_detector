 According to the Bible, Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men in several ways:

1. Perfect Obedience to God: Jesus was obedient to God the Father throughout His life on earth, even unto death (Philippians 2:8). He fulfilled all righteousness by living a sinless life (Matthew 3:15; 2 Corinthians 5:21).

2. Sacrifice for Sin: Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29). He offered Himself as a sacrifice for sin on the cross, providing redemption and atonement for mankind (Romans 5:8-9).

3. Ministry of Love and Compassion: Jesus showed love and compassion towards all people, especially the sick, the sinner, and the outcast (Matthew 20:34; Luke 7:13; Matthew 9:13). His ministry was characterized by healing, delivering, and restoring those in need.

4. Teaching God's Word: Jesus taught with authority and wisdom, proclaiming the truth of God's Kingdom (Matthew 7:28-29). He revealed the Father's will and nature to His disciples and to all who would listen (John 15:15).

5. Fulfillment of Prophecy: Jesus fulfilled numerous Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, demonstrating that He was God's chosen one (Isaiah 9:6-7; Matthew 1:22-23). This fulfillment validated His claim to be the Son of God.

In summary, Jesus demonstrated favor with God by His perfect obedience, sacrificial death, and fulfillment of prophecy. He demonstrated favor with men through His love, compassion, and ministry, as well as through His teaching and example.
