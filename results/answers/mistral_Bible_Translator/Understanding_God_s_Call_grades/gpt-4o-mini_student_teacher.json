  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provided a thorough explanation of what it means when the Bible states that God has called us by name, referencing relevant scriptures and explaining the significance of God's personal relationship and intention towards individuals. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the concept and effectively conveys the depth of God's love and care for each believer. The only aspect missing compared to the reference answer is the specific emphasis on God appointing individuals for his purpose, which is a key component of the biblical concept of being called by name. Overall, the student's response aligns well with a Christian worldview and effectively addresses the concern presented."
