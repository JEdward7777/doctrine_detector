## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Call.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The phrase "God calls us by name" is found in various parts of the Bible, most notably in Isaiah 43:1 and Zechariah 2:8, where God says, "Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name; you are mine." This concept also appears in Exodus 3:4 and Hosea 11:4.

The idea behind this statement is that God has a personal relationship with each individual believer, and He knows us intimately. By calling us by name, God is demonstrating His intimate knowledge of us and His unique claim on our lives. It signifies that we are not just part of the crowd or mass, but rather, we are precious to Him and have a special place in His heart.

This concept is often interpreted as evidence of God's personal care for each believer, His sovereignty over their lives, and His desire for an intimate relationship with them. It reminds us that God knows our deepest desires, struggles, hopes, fears, and dreams - even before we were born (Jeremiah 1:5).

Ultimately, being called by name signifies the depth of God's love for each person who believes in Him, as well as His commitment to walking with us throughout our lives.
