## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, being "called" by God refers to a divine invitation or summoning in which God makes known His purpose and will for an individual's life. This concept is rooted in both Old and New Testament scriptures.

In the Old Testament, we see examples of individuals like Moses (Exodus 3:4-10) and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 1:5) being called by God for specific roles and missions. In the New Testament, Jesus calls various disciples, such as Peter, Andrew, James, John, and Matthew, to follow Him (Matthew 4:18-22).

Being called by God is a significant moment in a Christian's life and can involve a variety of vocations or spiritual paths. Some Christians may feel called to full-time ministry, while others might discern a calling to serve their community, care for the marginalized, or simply to grow spiritually as they live out their faith in their daily lives.

A call from God is often characterized by a deep sense of peace, purpose, and fulfillment as one responds obediently to the divine invitation. It may require discernment, prayer, guidance from spiritual mentors, and sometimes personal sacrifice. Ultimately, answering a call from God requires faith in His goodness, provision, and sovereignty over one's life.
