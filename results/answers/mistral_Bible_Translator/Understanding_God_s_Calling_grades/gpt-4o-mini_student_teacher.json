  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-supported answer explaining the concept of being \"called\" by God in Christian theology, drawing from both Old and New Testament examples. The response also highlighted the diverse vocational paths that can stem from this calling and emphasized the importance of discernment, prayer, and faith in responding to God's call. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith as explicitly as the reference answer."
