It effectively expands on the concept with references to scripture and examples from both the Old and New Testaments. The emphasis on discernment, obedience, and faith in responding to God's call is well articulated. The response successfully addresses the concern of understanding personal purpose in the context of faith with a solid Christian worldview perspective."
