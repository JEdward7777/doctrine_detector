## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In biblical terms, God's glory refers to His divine nature, character, and majesty that reveals His perfection, power, wisdom, goodness, and holiness. It is the radiance of His essence manifested in creation, providence, and redemption. This glory is not a self-centered or egoistic pursuit as seen in worldly sources of glory, but rather it's an outpouring of love, grace, and justice for humanity.

In contrast, worldly sources of glory often stem from human ambition, pride, power, or success, focusing primarily on personal gain and recognition. Biblical glory is inherently selfless, seeking the welfare and salvation of others, as exemplified by Jesus Christ in His life, death, and resurrection (John 17:5).

Therefore, the biblical concept of God's glory reflects a deep sense of reverence, worship, and devotion towards the Creator who is worthy of all praise and honor. It calls believers to live humbly, serve others, and glorify God in their daily lives (1 Corinthians 10:31).
