  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and insightful explanation of the concept of God's glory in comparison to worldly sources of glory. They emphasized the selfless nature of God's glory and its focus on love, grace, and justice, contrasting it effectively with the human-centered nature of worldly glory. The student also connected their understanding to biblical examples, such as Jesus Christ, and highlighted the importance of worship and humble service in response to God's glory. While the student's response overall aligns well with the Christian worldview, their explanation could have more directly addressed the teacher's reference answer by emphasizing the immeasurable superiority of God's glory."
