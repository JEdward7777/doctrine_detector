## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Seeking God's will in our everyday decisions means striving to align our choices, actions, and thoughts with God's plan for our lives as revealed in His Word (the Bible) and through the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This process often involves prayer, study of Scripture, seeking wisdom from spiritual leaders or mentors, and being sensitive to the promptings of the Holy Spirit.

In Proverbs 3:5-6, it is written, "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." This passage encourages us to seek God's guidance in our lives and trust that He will lead us in the right direction.

Additionally, the book of James 1:5 teaches us, "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him." This passage reminds us that we can seek guidance from God when faced with difficult decisions or situations.

Ultimately, seeking God's will means pursuing a relationship with Him and being obedient to His commands, while also trusting in His provision and protection for our lives.
