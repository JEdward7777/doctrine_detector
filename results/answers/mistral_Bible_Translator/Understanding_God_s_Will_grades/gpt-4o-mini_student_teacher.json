  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer an 85.\n\nThe student's response effectively captures the essence of seeking God's will in everyday decisions by emphasizing the importance of aligning choices with God's plan revealed in His Word. They appropriately reference relevant Bible verses to support their points, demonstrating a strong Biblical foundation to their understanding. However, the student could have been more concise and focused on directly addressing the concern by addressing how individuals may struggle with decision-making or feeling uncertain about God's direction. Additionally, while the student's answer is thorough, it could have delved deeper into the aspect of surrendering personal desires and embracing God's will in decision-making."
