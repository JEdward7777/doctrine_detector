  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of what it means to seek God's will, emphasizing the importance of aligning our choices with His plan as revealed in Scripture. It also references specific biblical passages that support the idea of seeking guidance from God. The tone is encouraging and emphasizes the importance of pursuing a relationship with God while trusting in His provision and protection.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by providing more practical examples or illustrations of what seeking God's will looks like in everyday life. Additionally, while the passage references are relevant and supportive, they could be further developed to illustrate how they apply specifically to the concern about struggling with making decisions that honor God.\n\nOverall, this is a strong response that provides a solid foundation for understanding and applying the concept of seeking God's will. With some additional practical examples or illustrations, it could be even more effective in addressing the concern about feeling uncertain about God's direction."
