  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 95/100**\n\n**Comments:** This is an excellent response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the nature of God's wrath and its distinction from human anger from a Christian perspective. The student clearly articulates the theological concepts of God's holiness, justice, and love, and how these attributes inform the nature of God's wrath. The response also highlights the purpose of God's wrath as a means of upholding justice and offering redemption through faith in Jesus Christ."
