The distinction between God's wrath and human anger is clearly explained, highlighting that God's wrath is not driven by personal emotions but is a measured response to sin. The redemptive aspect of God's wrath, as demonstrated through Christ's sacrifice, is also well articulated. The only minor improvement could be adding a bit more emphasis on the redemptive aspect early on in the response."
