  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid and accurate explanation of grace in a Christian context. The student effectively articulates key aspects of grace, including God's unmerited favor, salvation, sanctification, divine love, kindness, and mercy. They also correctly emphasize the role of grace in empowering believers to live according to God's will and grow in holiness through the Holy Spirit. The inclusion of biblical reference (Ephesians 2:8-9) further strengthens the answer. Well done!"
