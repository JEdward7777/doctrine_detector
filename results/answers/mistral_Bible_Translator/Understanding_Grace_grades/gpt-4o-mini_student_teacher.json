  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the concept of grace in a Christian context, covering aspects such as God's unmerited favor, salvation, sanctification, divine love, kindness, and mercy. The answer also correctly emphasizes that grace is freely given by God and not something that can be earned through human efforts. The student's response aligns well with the reference answer, but could have been improved by directly using the phrase \"help or blessing given by God to sinful human beings\" to mirror the teacher's definition more closely."
