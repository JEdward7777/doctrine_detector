## [Answer](../Understanding_Grace.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a Christian context, the term 'grace' signifies God's unmerited favor towards humanity and His gifts of salvation and sanctification. It is an expression of divine love, kindness, and mercy given to people who do not deserve it because of their sinfulness (Ephesians 2:8-9). Grace enables believers to live according to the will of God and to grow in holiness through the power of the Holy Spirit. The concept of grace underscores the central message of the Christian faith, emphasizing that salvation is a free gift from God, rather than something earned by good works or human effort.
