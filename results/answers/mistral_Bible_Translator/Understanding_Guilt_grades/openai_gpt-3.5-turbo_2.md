## [Answer](../Understanding_Guilt.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Bible, guilt refers to a state of moral blameworthiness or culpability for an offense or transgression against God or His laws. This concept is often tied to the idea of sin, which is any act or thought that goes against God's perfect righteousness and standards as defined in the Bible.

The Old Testament uses various terms to express guilt, such as "asham" (a sense of shame or regret for wrongdoing), "chata'ah" (sin or missing the mark set by God), and "avon" (iniquity or moral perverseness). In the New Testament, words like "hamartia" (missing the mark or sin), "adikia" (wickedness or injustice), and "poneros" (evil) are used to convey the concept of guilt.

Being guilty according to the Bible is essentially falling short of God's perfect standards, and it carries the consequence of separation from God and spiritual death. However, the good news of the Gospel is that Jesus Christ came to redeem mankind by taking upon Himself the penalty for our sins on the cross, making it possible for those who repent and believe in Him to be forgiven and reconciled with their Creator.
