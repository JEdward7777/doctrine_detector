## Question [Understanding Heaven's Definition](../../questions/Understanding_Heaven_s_Definition.md)
What is the biblical definition of 'heaven' and how does it differ from 'sky'?

## Target answer from notes
In the Bible, 'heaven' usually refers to where God lives, while 'sky' refers to the blue expanse above the earth. The term 'heavens' encompasses everything above the earth, including celestial bodies like the sun and stars.

## Concern to grade by
It's essential to understand the different meanings attributed to these terms in Scripture, as they can impact our understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him.

## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 As a Christian Bible translator, I can help clarify the concept of "heaven" and distinguish it from the "sky" based on biblical teachings.

1. Heaven: The Bible presents three different meanings for the term "heaven," although they share an underlying commonality in their otherworldly nature.
   a) Physical Sky (Korab): This is the visible atmosphere we see day-to-day, often referred to as the firmament in Scripture (Genesis 1:8).
   b) Heaven of Blessings (Shamayim): This heavenly realm is above the physical sky and serves as God's dwelling place (2 Chronicles 6:18; Psalm 103:19). It is home to angels, cherubim, and seraphim.
   c) New Jerusalem/Eternal Home (Ouran): This heavenly realm is the abode of God (Revelation 21-22), where believers will dwell with Him eternally after this life.

2. Sky: The term "sky" generally refers to the visible atmosphere above the earth, which includes clouds, stars, and other celestial bodies. It is the physical layer we can observe and often serves as a backdrop for events on earth (e.g., Genesis 1:6-8).

It's essential to note that while these two terms share similarities, they represent distinct concepts in biblical teaching: the visible atmosphere (sky) and the invisible realm of God's presence or ultimate dwelling place (heaven).
