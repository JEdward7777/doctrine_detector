  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and accurate explanation of the biblical definitions of 'heaven' and 'sky,' drawing from relevant Scripture references. The distinctions between the physical sky, heaven as God's dwelling place, and the heavenly realm as the eternal home of believers are clearly articulated. The student effectively communicates the difference between these terms in a biblically sound manner. Great job!"
