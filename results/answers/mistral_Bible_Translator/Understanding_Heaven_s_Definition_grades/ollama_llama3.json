  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern by acknowledging that \"heaven\" and \"sky\" have different meanings in Scripture. However, it oversimplifies the distinction between the two terms and fails to provide nuanced explanations of their biblical contexts. Specifically, the response does not recognize the multiple uses of \"heaven\" in the Bible (e.g., physical sky, heavenly realm, and eternal home) or the importance of distinguishing between these meanings for a deeper understanding of God's nature and our relationship with Him.\n\nThe provided answer also lacks specific scriptural references to support its claims, which is an important aspect of biblical interpretation. While it attempts to summarize the basic distinction between \"heaven\" and \"sky,\" the response could be improved by providing more detailed explanations and biblical examples that align with the concern."
