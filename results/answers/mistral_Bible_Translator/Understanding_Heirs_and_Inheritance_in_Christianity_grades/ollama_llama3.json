The provided answer does mention faith and receiving God's promises, which is in line with the concern, but it lacks specific biblical references and explanations. The response could be improved by providing more concrete examples from Scripture to illustrate the concept of inheritance in a Christian context.\n\nThe LLM response provides a good start, explaining the connection between being an heir and receiving God's promises, citing relevant biblical passages like Galatians 3:29 and Romans 8:17. It also lists some of the spiritual blessings that believers receive through faith. However, it could be more detailed in its explanation, providing additional examples from Scripture to support its claims."
