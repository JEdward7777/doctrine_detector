The response clearly articulates the nature of God's holiness as perfect moral purity and righteousness, and how this sets a high standard for human perfection. The inclusion of the Gospel as the means of reconciliation between God and humanity is also well-articulated. Additionally, the student's explanation of sanctification and the need to live a life reflecting God's holiness demonstrates a deep understanding of Christian doctrine."
