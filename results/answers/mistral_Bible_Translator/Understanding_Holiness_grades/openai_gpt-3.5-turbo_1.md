# Question [Understanding Holiness](../../../questions/Understanding_Holiness.md)
What does it mean for God to be absolutely holy, and how does that affect our relationship with Him?

# Correct Answer
God's absolute holiness means He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection, which indicates that we cannot approach Him without His allowance due to our sinful nature.

# Stated Concern
This question prompts reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God.

# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christianity, God's holiness signifies His perfect moral purity, righteousness, and perfection in every way. This means He is separate from all sin and impurity, and He cannot condone or participate in anything unholy or evil.

Regarding our relationship with Him, God's holiness sets a high standard for us as humans who are imperfect and sinful by nature. The gap between God's holiness and our sinfulness is too wide for us to bridge on our own. However, this is where the good news of the Gospel comes in. Through Jesus Christ, who was both fully human and fully divine, we can be reconciled to God.

Jesus, being perfect and holy, took upon Himself the penalty for our sins when He died on the cross. By accepting Jesus as our Lord and Savior, we can be forgiven of our sins and made righteous in God's eyes. Therefore, our relationship with God is restored, not because we have earned it, but out of His grace and mercy.

To maintain a close relationship with Him, we are called to live a life that reflects the holiness of God as best as we can through obedience to His commands and seeking to love and serve others selflessly. This is often referred to as sanctification, which is a lifelong process of becoming more like Christ.

Ultimately, our relationship with God is built on the foundation of His holiness, which demonstrates His justice, righteousness, and love for us. It serves as a reminder that He alone is worthy of worship and praise, and we are called to strive towards holiness in all aspects of our lives.
