## [Answer](../Understanding_Humility.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 Humbling oneself before God, according to the Christian perspective, means recognizing and acknowledging one's complete dependence on God for everything - life, salvation, strength, guidance, and even daily provision. It involves admitting one's sinfulness, acknowledging that apart from God, we can do nothing (John 15:5). Humility before God also includes a willingness to obey His commands and submit to His will in our lives. This posture of humility leads to a deeper relationship with God, as demonstrated by Jesus, who, though He was God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant (Philippians 2:5-7). In essence, humbling oneself before God is about recognizing our place in the grand scheme of things, as creatures created by and for God, and responding accordingly with reverence, obedience, and gratitude.
