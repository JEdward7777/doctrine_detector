It goes beyond merely submitting one's will to God by delving into the deeper aspects of recognizing complete dependence on God, admitting sinfulness, willingness to obey, and understanding one's place in relation to God. The biblical references and examples used strengthen the argument and demonstrate a solid understanding of humility in the context of one's relationship with God. Great job!"
