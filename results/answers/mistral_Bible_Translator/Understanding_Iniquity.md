## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 As a Christian Bible translator, I am committed to providing an accurate and faithful translation of Scripture while also aiming to clarify the nuances between related terms within their biblical context. In this case, we will examine the biblical usage of "iniquity," "sin," and "transgression."

1. Sin (Hebrew: châtâth, Greek: hamartía): Sin refers to a broad category of human rebellion against God. It encompasses both actions and inactions that go against God's will. The New Testament often emphasizes sin as a spiritual condition characterized by estrangement from God and separation from His divine life (Romans 3:23).

2. Iniquity (Hebrew: avon, Greek: anômia): While sin is more of a spiritual or moral nature, iniquity often emphasizes the act itself that violates justice and righteousness. It can refer to immoral actions but also to behavior that is unjust, crooked, or devious (Proverbs 21:4).

3. Transgression (Hebrew: pāsha', Greek: paraptōma): A transgression is an act of disobedience, particularly against a specific divine law or commandment. It highlights the idea of crossing over a boundary or boundary-breaking behavior (Numbers 15:30).

While there can be overlap in these terms, understanding their differences can help to gain a more nuanced perspective on the Bible's teaching concerning human sinfulness and God's response to it.
