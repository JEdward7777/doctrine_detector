  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and insightful explanation of the biblical distinctions between iniquity, sin, and transgression. They have accurately defined each term within its biblical context and provided relevant scriptural references. However, the student's explanation slightly deviates from the teacher's reference answer by emphasizing iniquity as behavior that violates justice and righteousness rather than deliberate acts of wrongdoing or great wickedness. Overall, the student has demonstrated a strong understanding of the nuances between these terms, which can indeed help Christians recognize the gravity of their actions and seek repentance."
