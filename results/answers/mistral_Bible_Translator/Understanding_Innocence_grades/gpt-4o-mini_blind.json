  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as an 85. \n\nThe answer provides a solid explanation of the term \"innocent\" in the context of being wrongfully accused according to biblical teachings. It references relevant biblical examples like Joseph and Job to support its points. The explanation is clear and aligns well with Christian doctrine. \n\nHowever, to improve the grade, the response could delve deeper into the theological implications of innocence and the concept of righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. Additionally, a more explicit connection to the redemption and forgiveness provided through Christ could enhance the doctrinal completeness of the answer."
