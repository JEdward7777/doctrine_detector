  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid understanding of innocence in the biblical context, referencing stories of Joseph and Job to support their explanation. They accurately convey that innocence in the Bible relates to not committing the wrongdoing one is accused of. However, the student's response could be improved by emphasizing that the core of biblical innocence is about guilt or lack thereof, rather than solely adhering to moral standards."
