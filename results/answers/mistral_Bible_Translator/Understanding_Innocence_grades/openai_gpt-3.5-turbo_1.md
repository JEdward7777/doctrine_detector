# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the biblical context, the term "innocent" signifies an individual who has not committed any wrongdoing or transgression. However, it is important to note that the concept of innocence is often tied to the moral standards set forth by God as described in the Bible.

In the story of Joseph (Genesis 39), we see a clear example of an innocent person who was wrongfully accused. Potiphar's wife falsely accused Joseph of attempting to seduce her, but Joseph had refused her advances and maintained his integrity. In this case, Joseph is considered innocent because he did not commit the sin that he was accused of.

Another instance can be found in the story of Job (Job 1:1), where Job is described as a "perfect and upright man, who fears God and shuns evil." Despite being wrongfully accused by his friends of hiding some sort of sin (Job 13:7), Job remains innocent because he has lived a righteous life according to God's standards.

Therefore, in the biblical sense, an innocent person is one who has not sinned and has been falsely or unfairly accused. They are considered blameless and upright in the eyes of God.
