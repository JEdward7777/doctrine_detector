It effectively ties the concept of innocence to the moral standards set forth by God in the Bible. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the Christian perspective on innocence and how it relates to justice and mercy. It appropriately addresses the concern by clarifying the concept of innocence in Christian teachings. Great job!"
