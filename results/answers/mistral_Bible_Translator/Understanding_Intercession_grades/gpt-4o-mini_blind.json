The student accurately cites Romans 8:26-27 and 1 John 5:6-9 to support their points. However, the response could have been strengthened by adding more depth to the theological significance of the Holy Spirit's intercessory role in the believer's life. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound answer. Great job!"
