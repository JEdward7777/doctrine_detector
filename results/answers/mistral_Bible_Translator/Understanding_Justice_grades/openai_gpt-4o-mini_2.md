This includes loving our neighbors as ourselves (Matthew 22:39), doing justice, and loving kindness (Micah 6:8), and treating the less fortunate with dignity and compassion (Proverbs 14:31). It also means living according to God's commandments, such as not stealing, lying, or bearing false witness against our neighbors (Exodus 20:15-16).
