They effectively integrated biblical references and a Christian worldview to explain how lamentation can help believers navigate through difficult times with honesty, faith, growth, and comfort. However, the student could have focused more specifically on addressing the concern of struggling Christians in expressing their sorrows and regrets in a faith context, by emphasizing how lamentation can serve as a healthy outlet for those struggles and help believers find healing and closeness to God."
