  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the term \"Lord\" in relation to both God the Father and Jesus Christ, acknowledging their distinct roles and significance. The response effectively captures the importance of understanding the authority and divinity represented by the term. However, the student could have emphasized more explicitly the aspect of ownership and authority when referring to Jesus as God in the context of the term \"Lord,\" as highlighted in the reference answer."
