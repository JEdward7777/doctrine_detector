  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's character from a Christian perspective. The student effectively ties the concept of majesty to God's attributes such as dignity, glory, splendor, and sovereignty, supported by relevant Bible verses. The emphasis on humility, awe, and reverence in approaching God's majesty is well articulated. The response could benefit from a deeper exploration of the implications of God's majesty in the believer's life, but overall, it showcases a strong understanding of the topic."
