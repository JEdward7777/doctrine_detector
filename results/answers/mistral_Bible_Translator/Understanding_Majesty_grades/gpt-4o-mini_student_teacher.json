  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-detailed and comprehensive explanation of the term \"majesty\" in relation to God's character from a Christian perspective. The response included relevant Bible verses and effectively highlighted the implications of God's majesty in reflecting His sovereignty and attributes. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly linking the concept of God's majesty to His sovereignty over creation, as indicated in the concern. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic."
