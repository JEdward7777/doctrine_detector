It effectively connects the term 'majesty' to the greatness and splendor of God as the supreme King over the universe, addressing the concern about understanding God's attributes and sovereignty over creation in a comprehensive and insightful manner. The biblical references provided further support the argument and demonstrate a strong understanding of the Christian worldview. Great job!"
