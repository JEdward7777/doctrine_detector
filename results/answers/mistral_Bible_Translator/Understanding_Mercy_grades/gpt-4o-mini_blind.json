  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and thoughtful answer on demonstrating mercy in daily lives based on God's merciful nature. The response includes practical examples and references to Biblical teachings, showing a good understanding of the topic. However, one area for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of acknowledging our own need for God's mercy and grace in order to extend the same to others. Additionally, a more explicit connection to Jesus Christ as the ultimate example of mercy could have been included. Overall, a strong and well-rounded response."
