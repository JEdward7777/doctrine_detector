## [Answer](../Understanding_New_Birth.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the Bible, being "born again" refers to a spiritual rebirth or renewal that occurs when an individual accepts Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord. This concept is primarily found in the Gospel of John (3:3) and elaborated upon by Jesus in verses 5-8:

"Jesus answered, 'Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at my saying, "You must be born again." The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.'"

In this passage, Jesus explains that a physical birth (water) is not enough for entrance into God's kingdom; one must also be spiritually reborn through the work of the Holy Spirit. This spiritual rebirth results in a transformed life and a new relationship with God. The Apostle Peter further clarifies this concept in 1 Peter 1:23:

"For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God."

In summary, being "born again" means receiving a new spiritual life through faith in Jesus Christ, made possible by the working of the Holy Spirit, and experiencing a transformation that leads to a new relationship with God. This concept is central to Christian theology as it represents the means by which sinners can be reconciled to their Creator.
