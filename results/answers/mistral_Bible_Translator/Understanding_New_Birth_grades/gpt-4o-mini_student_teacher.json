  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of what it means to be \"born again\" according to the Bible, referencing relevant scriptures and explaining the concept in depth. The response effectively conveys the centrality of spiritual rebirth through Jesus Christ and the work of the Holy Spirit. It aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, but could have been improved by focusing more on the direct explanation without including some additional descriptive details."
