The mention of spiritual destruction and eternal death aligns well with the concern of exploring the implications of spiritual separation from God. However, it could have been strengthened by incorporating more scriptural references or theological depth to further solidify the explanation. Overall, it effectively addresses the concern with a solid Christian perspective."
