## [Answer](../Understanding_Propitiation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian theology, the concept of propitiation refers to the act by which God's wrath and judgment against sin are turned away or appeased. This is a key aspect of understanding Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.

In the Old Testament, the annual Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) was a ceremony in which the High Priest would offer various sacrifices for the sins of the Israelite people. These sacrifices were not to appease an angry deity, but rather to remind God of His covenant with His people and to provide a tangible symbol of their repentance and faithfulness.

In the New Testament, Jesus' sacrifice is seen as the ultimate propitiation for sin. Hebrews 2:17 states, "For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people."

Jesus, as the sinless Son of God, willingly took upon Himself the penalty for the sins of humanity. Romans 3:25 explains, "God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood." By doing so, Jesus not only paid the debt owed by sinners but also demonstrated God's great love and desire to reconcile humanity to Himself.

In this sense, the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of propitiation is that it satisfied God's justice while demonstrating His mercy and grace. It is through faith in Christ's atoning work on the cross that people can find forgiveness for their sins and receive eternal life.
