The writer also effectively connects Jesus' sacrifice to the concept of atonement, demonstrating how it provides a means for sinners to receive forgiveness and eternal life. The only area for improvement is that the response could be more explicit in linking propitiation to God's mercy and justice, as specified in the concern. However, the overall answer effectively addresses the concern and demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian theology.\n\nNote: The response does not explicitly mention God's mercy, but it does mention His great love and desire to reconcile humanity to Himself, which indirectly suggests God's mercy."
