It emphasizes the biblical basis for understanding how propitiation satisfies God's justice while demonstrating His mercy and grace, thus clearly addressing the concern raised. However, to enhance the response further, a direct reference to the sacrificial system in the Old Testament and its fulfillment in Jesus Christ could have been included."
