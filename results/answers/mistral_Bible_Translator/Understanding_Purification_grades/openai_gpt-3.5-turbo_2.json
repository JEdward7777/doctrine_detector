It effectively addresses the concern by explaining how the process of ritual purification reflects God's standards for holiness and the nature of sin. Additionally, it appropriately connects the Old Testament purification rituals to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Overall, a well-articulated and well-supported response from a Christian worldview perspective."
