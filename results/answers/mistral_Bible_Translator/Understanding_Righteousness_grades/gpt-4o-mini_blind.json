The student effectively conveys the idea of God's moral perfection, faithfulness to His character, and the transcendent nature of His righteousness. The inclusion of qualities such as justice, holiness, truth, goodness, love, mercy, and faithfulness adds depth to the understanding of God's righteousness. Additionally, the explanation of how God's righteousness sets the standard for human morality and the need for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ is well articulated. Overall, a strong and doctrinally sound response."
