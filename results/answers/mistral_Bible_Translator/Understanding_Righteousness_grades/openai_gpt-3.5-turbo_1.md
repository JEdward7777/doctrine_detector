This righteousness is not humanly defined but is a standard that transcends human understanding. It encompasses qualities such as justice, holiness, truth, goodness, love, mercy, and faithfulness. When God is said to be righteous, it means He always acts in accordance with His perfect moral character without any deviation or compromise.
