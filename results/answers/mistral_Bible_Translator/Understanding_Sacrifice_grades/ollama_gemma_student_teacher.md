## Question [Understanding Sacrifice](../../../questions/Understanding_Sacrifice.md)
Why is Jesus referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament?

## Correct Answer
Jesus is called the 'Lamb of God' because he was a perfect and unblemished sacrifice who paid for people's sins, analogous to the sacrifices of perfect lambs commanded in the Old Testament.

## Stated Concern
This question aims to help Christians understand the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Sacrifice.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The title "Lamb of God" for Jesus is a significant symbol that connects the New Testament with the Old Testament, emphasizing the fulfillment of prophecies and the redemption provided by Christ. This term is rooted in several key passages from the Old Testament, particularly in Leviticus 4:35 and Isaiah 53.

In Leviticus 4:35, God commands that an unblemished male lamb is to be offered as a sin offering when an Israelite unintentionally sins against the Lord, demonstrating God's demand for a perfect sacrifice to atone for sin.

Isaiah 53, often referred to as the "Suffering Servant" passage, prophesies about a coming Messiah who would take upon Himself the iniquities of the people and be punished in their stead:

"But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed." (Isaiah 53:5)

Jesus, being sinless Himself (2 Corinthians 5:21), offered the perfect sacrifice as a Lamb without blemish. By His death on the cross, He took upon Himself the sins of mankind and provided redemption for all who believe in Him, fulfilling the Old Testament sacrifices and prophecies that pointed to this Messiah (John 1:29).
