The mention of free will and God's sovereignty in the interaction with Satan is good. However, I would encourage the student to also address Satan's origin as a fallen angel who led a rebellion against God, as this is a crucial aspect in understanding his nature. Additionally, a brief mention of Jesus' victory over Satan through His death and resurrection would enhance the completeness of the response."
