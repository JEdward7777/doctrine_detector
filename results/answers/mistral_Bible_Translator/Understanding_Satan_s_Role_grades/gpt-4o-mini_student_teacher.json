  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the significance of the name Satan in the context of the Christian faith. They correctly identified the Hebrew meaning of the name as \"adversary\" or \"accuser\" and discussed Satan's rebellion against God, role in tempting humans, and ultimate fate. The student also emphasized the limited power of Satan compared to God's sovereignty and the importance of free will in this spiritual battle.\n\nWhile the student's answer goes beyond the simple definition provided in the reference answer, their additional insights add depth and clarity to understanding Satan's role in spiritual warfare. This demonstrates a thorough understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
