  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer is well-written and comprehensively explains the meaning of the name \"Satan\" within the Christian faith. It accurately describes Satan as an angelic being who rebelled against God and his role as an adversary to humanity. The student also acknowledges the importance of free will and God's sovereignty in the relationship between humans and the devil. The conclusion about Satan's ultimate fate is also consistent with Christian eschatology."
