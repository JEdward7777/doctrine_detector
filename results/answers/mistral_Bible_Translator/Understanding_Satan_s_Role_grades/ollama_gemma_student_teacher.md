## [Answer](../Understanding_Satan_s_Role.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Christian faith, the name Satan (or Devil) signifies an angelic being who rebelliously opposed God and was cast out of heaven. The term "Satan" is a Hebrew word that means "adversary" or "accuser." In the Bible, Satan's role primarily consists of tempting humans to sin, testing their faith, and working as the evil counterpart to God. However, it is important to note that Satan does not have ultimate control over human destiny; ultimately, free will and God's sovereignty are at play in the relationship between humans and the devil. Satan's ultimate fate, according to Christian eschatology, is eternal damnation in hell.
