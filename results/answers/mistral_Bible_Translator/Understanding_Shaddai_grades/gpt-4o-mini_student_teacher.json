  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 85.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'Shaddai' in the context of the Old Testament, highlighting its meaning, usage, and significance in emphasizing God's power, omnipotence, and sovereignty. The student correctly pointed out the root verb \"shadad\" and its translation as \"Almighty God\" in English Bibles, showing a good understanding of the term.\n\nHowever, the student's explanation did not delve into the possible meaning of 'Shaddai' as 'mountain' or 'mountain range,' as suggested in the reference answer. Including this additional perspective would have made the answer more well-rounded and aligned with understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture, as the concern specified.\n\nOverall, the student showed a solid grasp of the term 'Shaddai,' its significance, and its context within the Old Testament, hence the grade of 85."
