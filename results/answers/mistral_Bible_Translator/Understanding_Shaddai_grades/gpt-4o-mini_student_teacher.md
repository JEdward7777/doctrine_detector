## [Answer](../Understanding_Shaddai.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 'Shaddai' is one of the names attributed to God in the Old Testament, primarily found within the Hebrew Bible. The name 'Shaddai' is derived from the Hebrew root verb "shadad," which means "to destroy, to overpower, or to almighty."

The term 'Shaddai' is often translated as "Almighty God" or "God of the Mountains" in English Bibles. It appears around 38 times in the Old Testament, with its first occurrence being in Genesis 17:1 when God changes Abram's name to Abraham and promises him many descendants, stating, "I am Almighty God; walk before me faithfully and blamelessly."

In context, 'Shaddai' emphasizes God's supreme power, omnipotence, and sovereignty over all things. It serves to remind His people of His mighty deeds and to inspire awe, trust, and obedience in those who encounter Him.

85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer as 85.

The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term 'Shaddai' in the context of the Old Testament, highlighting its meaning, usage, and significance in emphasizing God's power, omnipotence, and sovereignty. The student correctly pointed out the root verb "shadad" and its translation as "Almighty God" in English Bibles, showing a good understanding of the term.

However, the student's explanation did not delve into the possible meaning of 'Shaddai' as 'mountain' or 'mountain range,' as suggested in the reference answer. Including this additional perspective would have made the answer more well-rounded and aligned with understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture, as the concern specified.

Overall, the student showed a solid grasp of the term 'Shaddai,' its significance, and its context within the Old Testament, hence the grade of 85.
