  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the meaning and usage of the term 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament. It provides a concise definition of the name, its etymology, and its significance in the biblical text. However, the response would benefit from additional elaboration on the theological significance of the term and its implications for understanding the nature and attributes of God. Additionally, the student's answer does not address the specific concern related to understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture."
