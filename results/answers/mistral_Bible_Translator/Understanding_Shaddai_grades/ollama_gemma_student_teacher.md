## [Answer](../Understanding_Shaddai.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 'Shaddai' is one of the names attributed to God in the Old Testament, primarily found within the Hebrew Bible. The name 'Shaddai' is derived from the Hebrew root verb "shadad," which means "to destroy, to overpower, or to almighty."

The term 'Shaddai' is often translated as "Almighty God" or "God of the Mountains" in English Bibles. It appears around 38 times in the Old Testament, with its first occurrence being in Genesis 17:1 when God changes Abram's name to Abraham and promises him many descendants, stating, "I am Almighty God; walk before me faithfully and blamelessly."

In context, 'Shaddai' emphasizes God's supreme power, omnipotence, and sovereignty over all things. It serves to remind His people of His mighty deeds and to inspire awe, trust, and obedience in those who encounter Him.

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the meaning and usage of the term 'Shaddai' in the Old Testament. It provides a concise definition of the name, its etymology, and its significance in the biblical text. However, the response would benefit from additional elaboration on the theological significance of the term and its implications for understanding the nature and attributes of God. Additionally, the student's answer does not address the specific concern related to understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture.
