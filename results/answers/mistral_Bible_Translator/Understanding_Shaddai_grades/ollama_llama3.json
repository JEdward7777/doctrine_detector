  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides some accurate information about the term \"Shaddai\", such as its translation to \"the Almighty\" and its use in the Old Testament. It also attempts to provide insight into the meaning and origin of the name, which is commendable. However, there are a few areas where the response falls short:\n\n* The answer does not go beyond a simple definition or translation of the term \"Shaddai\", failing to explore its significance and attributes as revealed in Scripture.\n* The concern was to understand the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture, but this response only scratches the surface by mentioning that it may mean 'mountain' or 'mountain range', without providing further biblical context.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some accurate information, it does not fully address the concern of understanding the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture."
