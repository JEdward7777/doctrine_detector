  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise answer that accurately summarizes Jesus' strategies for resisting Satan's temptations, which is in line with the concern of understanding how to combat temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. The example from Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13 provides specific biblical support for the response.\n\nThe only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect Jesus' strategies (quoting scripture, using scripture against Satan's manipulations, and maintaining faith in God) to how they can be applied in daily life. The response is strong in its biblical foundation but could benefit from a more explicit call to action or practical application for the reader.\n\nComment: This response effectively demonstrates an understanding of Jesus' encounter with Satan and provides relevant biblical examples. To take it to the next level, consider explicitly highlighting how these strategies can be applied in daily life as a follower of Christ."
