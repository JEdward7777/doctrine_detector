## [Answer](../Understanding_Temptation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the New Testament of the Bible, when Jesus was tempted by Satan in Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13, He resisted the temptations through three primary strategies:

1. Quoting Scripture: In each instance of temptation, Jesus responded by quoting scriptures relevant to the situation at hand. For example, when Satan tempted Jesus to turn stones into bread, Jesus replied, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God." (Matthew 4:4)

2. Using Scripture against Satan's own manipulations: In one instance, Satan tempted Jesus to jump off the temple and rely on angels to save Him. However, Jesus countered by saying, "It is written again, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Luke 4:12) Here, Jesus used scripture to demonstrate that Satan's suggestion was not in line with God's will and purpose.

3. Maintaining faith in God: Throughout the encounter with Satan, Jesus remained steadfast in His belief and reliance on God the Father. He declared, "Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only." (Luke 4:8) By maintaining this focus, Jesus demonstrated that His primary allegiance was to God and not to fulfilling immediate desires or shortcuts to attain power.

By employing these strategies, Jesus set an example for all believers on how to resist temptation and remain steadfast in faith.

95.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 95.

The response provides a clear and concise answer that accurately summarizes Jesus' strategies for resisting Satan's temptations, which is in line with the concern of understanding how to combat temptation in daily life as a follower of Christ. The example from Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13 provides specific biblical support for the response.

The only area for improvement would be to explicitly connect Jesus' strategies (quoting scripture, using scripture against Satan's manipulations, and maintaining faith in God) to how they can be applied in daily life. The response is strong in its biblical foundation but could benefit from a more explicit call to action or practical application for the reader.

Comment: This response effectively demonstrates an understanding of Jesus' encounter with Satan and provides relevant biblical examples. To take it to the next level, consider explicitly highlighting how these strategies can be applied in daily life as a follower of Christ.
