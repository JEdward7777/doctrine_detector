## [Answer](../Understanding_Temptation.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 According to the New Testament of the Bible, when Jesus was tempted by Satan in Matthew 4:1-11 and Luke 4:1-13, He resisted the temptations through three primary strategies:

1. Quoting Scripture: In each instance of temptation, Jesus responded by quoting scriptures relevant to the situation at hand. For example, when Satan tempted Jesus to turn stones into bread, Jesus replied, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God." (Matthew 4:4)

2. Using Scripture against Satan's own manipulations: In one instance, Satan tempted Jesus to jump off the temple and rely on angels to save Him. However, Jesus countered by saying, "It is written again, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" (Luke 4:12) Here, Jesus used scripture to demonstrate that Satan's suggestion was not in line with God's will and purpose.

3. Maintaining faith in God: Throughout the encounter with Satan, Jesus remained steadfast in His belief and reliance on God the Father. He declared, "Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only." (Luke 4:8) By maintaining this focus, Jesus demonstrated that His primary allegiance was to God and not to fulfilling immediate desires or shortcuts to attain power.

By employing these strategies, Jesus set an example for all believers on how to resist temptation and remain steadfast in faith.
