  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student has demonstrated a clear understanding of the term \"transgress\" in a Biblical context by explaining it as going beyond or breaking God's laws or commandments, which aligns well with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student effectively supported their explanation with relevant biblical examples, such as the situations in Leviticus and Genesis, which further strengthen their understanding of the concept. Overall, the response shows a solid comprehension of the nature of sin and our relationship with God's commandments."
