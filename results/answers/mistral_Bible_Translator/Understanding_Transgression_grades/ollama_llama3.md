## [Answer](../Understanding_Transgression.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In a Biblical context, the term "transgress" generally implies going beyond or breaking God's laws or commandments. It signifies disobedience or sin. For example, Leviticus 19:30 says, "If a man acts dishonorably toward his neighbor in a matter of deposit or a pledge, or does anything else against his neighbor," - here the phrase "acts dishonorably" can be understood as transgressing against the neighbor. Similarly, when Adam and Eve ate from the forbidden tree in Genesis 3:6, they were said to have transgressed God's commandment.
