  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student has provided a generally accurate explanation of how trespass and sin are related in a Christian worldview. They have correctly identified that both involve transgressions against God's law and principles. However, the student's response could be improved by emphasizing that all sins are considered trespasses against God in Christian theology, as highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, they could have delved deeper into the interconnectedness of interpersonal violations and sins against God to better address the concern provided."
