  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the relationship between trespass and sin in a Christian worldview. It accurately explains that both concepts involve transgressions against God's law and principles. The student also provides relevant examples from scripture to support their argument. However, the answer could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of how trespass can be understood as a violation of human relationships in a Christian context."
