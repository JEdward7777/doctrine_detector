  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 90. \n\nThis response provides a thorough and detailed explanation of characteristics of an 'unholy' life from a Christian perspective, grounding them in relevant biblical verses. The student demonstrates a clear understanding of Christian theology and upholds doctrinal correctness throughout their response. The only area for improvement could be to include more explicit references to the concept of repentance and turning away from sin as a crucial aspect of recognizing and addressing an unholy life. Overall, a strong and well-supported answer."
