  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian teachings on living a holy life and provides a detailed list of characteristics of an unholy life. They effectively rely on biblical references to support their points. However, the response could have tied the characteristics back more explicitly to the concern of self-examination and awareness, and also included a more direct connection to the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, this is a well-written and well-supported answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
