 In the context of Biblical warnings and judgments, the term "woe" (often denoted as "woe to" or "alas for") is used to express strong condemnation, sorrow, or grief over impending judgment or calamity. It is often used in prophetic literature, such as the book of Isaiah, where it signifies God's displeasure and forthcoming punishment against sinful actions or behaviors.
