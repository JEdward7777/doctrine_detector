  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the term \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments. It correctly identifies \"woe\" as expressing strong condemnation, sorrow, and grief over impending judgment or calamity. The mention of its use in prophetic literature, like the book of Isaiah, and its connection to God's displeasure and punishment against sin is accurate. The student could further enhance their answer by incorporating scriptural references to specific instances where \"woe\" is used in the Bible to emphasize their explanation. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
