  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 90.\n\nThe student accurately explains the term \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments, highlighting its significance of strong condemnation and sorrow for impending judgment or calamity due to sinful actions. They appropriately mention the connection to prophetic literature, specifically the book of Isaiah, to support their explanation.\n\nThe student effectively conveys the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment through their explanation of the term \"woe.\" Their response aligns well with a Christian worldview, emphasizing the gravity of disobeying God's commands and the consequences that follow. The only minor improvement would be to explicitly mention the idea of suffering as a result of sin, as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
