  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"worldly\" in Christian teachings, supported by relevant Bible verses and a clear contrast between worldly behaviors/values and God's kingdom. The student effectively communicates the concept of living in the world but not being of it, while emphasizing the importance of aligning one's life with God's will. Good job!"
