## [Answer](../Understanding_Worldly_Values.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian teachings, the term "worldly" generally refers to behaviors, attitudes, or values that are patterned after or excessively focused on the things of the world rather than on God. The Bible often contrasts the world (Greek: kosmos) with God's kingdom, where the world represents sinful human nature and the temporary, material aspects of life.

1 Corinthians 2:12 states, "Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God." This verse highlights the contrast between the worldly spirit (fleshly, sinful) and the spiritual understanding that comes from God.

In this context, worldly behaviors can include things like pride, greed, lust, anger, and other sins that are not in line with God's will as revealed in the Bible. Worldly values may place greater emphasis on wealth, fame, status, or pleasure, rather than love for God and others, righteousness, and godliness.

Christian teachings encourage believers to live a life that is pleasing to God and focused on His kingdom, rather than being preoccupied with worldly desires and pursuits. Believers should strive to be "in the world but not of it" (John 17:14-16), recognizing that they are called to make a positive impact in the world while remaining separate from its sinful influences and values.
