  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a thorough and well-explained answer that captures the essence of what it means to be \"worldly\" according to Christian teachings. They have effectively contrasted worldly values with godly principles and have referenced relevant Biblical verses to support their explanation. However, the student could have emphasized more on the inherently sinful nature of worldly behaviors and values, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated in this response."
