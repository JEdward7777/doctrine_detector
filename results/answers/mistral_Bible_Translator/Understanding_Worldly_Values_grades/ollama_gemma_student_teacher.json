  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and articulate response that clearly demonstrates an understanding of the Christian perspective on the meaning of \"worldly.\" The student provides relevant biblical references and clearly explains the contrast between worldly and godly values. However, the response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the specific concern of understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles."
