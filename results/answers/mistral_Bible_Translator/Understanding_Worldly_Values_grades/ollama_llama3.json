The answer accurately identifies worldly values and behaviors as evil and opposed to God's will. The response also references relevant biblical passages (1 Corinthians 2:12 and John 17:14-16) to support this understanding.\n\nHowever, the response could be more comprehensive in its explanation of worldly values and behaviors, and might benefit from additional examples or a more detailed analysis of the contrast between worldly and godly principles. Nevertheless, the response effectively conveys the basic idea that worldly values and behaviors are opposed to God's kingdom and will."
