The student effectively explains that worship involves reverence, adoration, and obedience towards God, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging His supremacy and living out Christian values. The integration of Biblical references, particularly John 4:23-24, adds doctrinal support to the explanation. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound answer."
