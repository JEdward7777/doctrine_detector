  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of worship in a Christian context, emphasizing the reverence, adoration, and submission to God. They correctly highlight the importance of acknowledging God's supremacy, holiness, and sovereignty, as well as the various forms through which worship can be expressed. The incorporation of Scripture reference (John 4:23-24) further strengthens their response. However, the student's answer could have included more direct reference to acts such as prostration, serving God, and offering sacrifices as mentioned in the reference answer to align more closely with the specific concern of understanding worship in a Christian's life."
