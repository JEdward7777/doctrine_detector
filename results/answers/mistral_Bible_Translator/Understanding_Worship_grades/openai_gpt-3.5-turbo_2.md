 Worship, in a Christian context, refers to the act of reverencing or honoring God, expressing adoration, love, and obedience towards Him. It involves acknowledging His supremacy, holiness, and sovereignty, as well as submitting oneself to His will. This can be expressed through prayer, singing praises, reading and studying the Scriptures, observing religious rituals or sacraments, and living a life that reflects Christian values.
