  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a solid explanation of the significance of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" in relation to the people of Israel from a biblical perspective. It accurately conveys the metaphorical representation of Jerusalem and the Jewish people as cherished by God and highlights the emotional and affectionate connotation behind the term. The student demonstrates an understanding of the theological implications and the varying contexts in which the term is used within the Bible. However, a slightly deeper exploration of the spiritual and prophetic significance of the term could have enhanced the response further."
