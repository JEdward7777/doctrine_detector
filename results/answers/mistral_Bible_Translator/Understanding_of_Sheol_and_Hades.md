## Question [Understanding of Sheol and Hades](../../questions/Understanding_of_Sheol_and_Hades.md)
How do the concepts of Sheol and Hades differ in the context of the Bible, especially in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous?

## Target answer from notes
In biblical context, Sheol and Hades refer to a place of the dead but were understood differently over time. Initially, both represented a neutral place where all the dead awaited judgment. However, in the New Testament, Hades becomes associated primarily with the unrighteous, contrasting with 'Abraham's side' or 'paradise' for the righteous.

## Concern to grade by
Understanding the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death.

## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible), the term "Sheol" is used to describe the place where all the dead go, regardless of their righteousness or wickedness. It is a state of unconsciousness and silence, often described as a dark underworld where both the righteous and the unrighteous reside. The exact location, nature, or conditions within Sheol are not clearly defined.

In contrast, "Hades" appears in the New Testament (Greek Bible) to refer to the underworld realm ruled by Hades or Pluto. In Greek mythology, Hades was associated with the dead and the underworld, but in the New Testament, it is used interchangeably with Sheol and carries similar connotations. However, some scholars suggest that the New Testament may imply a distinction between Hades (a temporary holding place for the souls of the dead) and the final destination of the saved (heaven) or the damned (hell).

It is important to note that interpretations of these concepts can vary among different Christian denominations and theologians. The Bible does not provide a clear picture of the afterlife for the righteous versus the unrighteous, but it emphasizes living a righteous life as the primary focus rather than focusing on the details of the afterlife. The ultimate destination of individuals is often depicted as being determined by their faith and relationship with God.
