  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 70.\n\n- The student provides a general overview of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the Bible, discussing their origins and usage in the Old and New Testaments.\n- The explanation of Sheol as a common dwelling place for both the righteous and unrighteous in the Old Testament context is correct.\n- The student accurately mentions the Greek mythology association with Hades and the possible distinction between Hades as a temporary holding place and the final destinations.\n- The answer acknowledges the variation in interpretations among Christian denominations and theologians, which is a good recognition of the diversity of views on this subject.\n  \nHowever, the response lacks depth in exploring the doctrinal implications of Sheol and Hades in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous. It would be beneficial for the student to delve further into the theological significance of these concepts within Christian belief and address key doctrinal differences that arise from varying interpretations. Additionally, tying in more scriptural references to support the analysis would strengthen the argument and provide a more solid basis for the discussion."
