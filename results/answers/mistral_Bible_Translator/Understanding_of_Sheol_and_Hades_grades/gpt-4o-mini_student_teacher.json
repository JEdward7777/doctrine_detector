  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in relation to the afterlife of the righteous versus the unrighteous, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. They accurately described Sheol as a place where all the dead go, regardless of righteousness, and touched on the potential distinctions between Hades as a temporary holding place. However, the student could have further emphasized the evolving understanding of these concepts over time and the shift in associations with the righteous and unrighteous. Overall, a good attempt but some key aspects could be further elaborated on for a more comprehensive answer."
