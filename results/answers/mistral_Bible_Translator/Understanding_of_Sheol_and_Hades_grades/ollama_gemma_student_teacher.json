  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and insightful response that clearly explains the differences between Sheol and Hades in the Bible. It accurately summarizes the initial understanding of both concepts as neutral places of the dead, before highlighting the shift in the New Testament where Hades becomes associated with the unrighteous. The response also acknowledges the lack of clarity in the Bible regarding the afterlife of the righteous and emphasizes the importance of living a righteous life."
