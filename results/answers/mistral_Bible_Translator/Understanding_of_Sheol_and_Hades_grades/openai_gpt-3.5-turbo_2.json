  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the evolution of the understanding of Sheol and Hades in biblical context, specifically addressing the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous after death as requested. It effectively highlights the shift in perception from a neutral place to one associated primarily with the unrighteous in the New Testament. The inclusion of 'Abraham's side' and 'paradise' as contrasting destinations for the righteous adds depth to the discussion. Overall, this response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern raised."
