  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This is an excellent response that provides a thorough explanation of the role of Jesus Christ as the \"cornerstone\" in the context of the Assembly of believers. The student effectively connects the architectural metaphor of the cornerstone to Jesus Christ's foundational and unifying role within the Church. The integration of relevant scriptural references enhances the theological aspect of the answer. Well done!"
