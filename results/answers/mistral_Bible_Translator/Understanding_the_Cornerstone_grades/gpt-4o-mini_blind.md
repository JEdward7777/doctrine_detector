## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Cornerstone.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of the Assembly (or Church) of believers, Jesus Christ plays a central and foundational role, symbolized as the "cornerstone" in Scripture. This metaphor is used several times in the New Testament, notably in Matthew 21:42, Ephesians 2:20, and 1 Peter 2:6-7.

The cornerstone is a crucial piece of architecture that holds together the entire structure. In this analogy, Jesus Christ is not just another stone but the essential one upon which the Church is built. He is the foundation upon which the community of believers rests.

In addition to being a structural element, Jesus is also the spiritual cornerstone. This means that He provides the moral, ethical, and theological framework for the Christian life and the Church's teachings. Furthermore, as the Chief Cornerstone, Christ serves as the ultimate point of unity among believers. As they gather together in His name, they are united by their shared faith in Him.

Thus, Jesus Christ as the cornerstone is the source of unity, strength, and structure for the Church of believers.
