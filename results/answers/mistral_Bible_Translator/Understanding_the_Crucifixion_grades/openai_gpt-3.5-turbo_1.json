The answer effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how the crucifixion fulfilled prophecy and God's plan for redemption through the atonement for human sins. The only slight improvement could be providing a brief mention of the resurrection, as it is also integral to the complete understanding of salvation in Christianity."
