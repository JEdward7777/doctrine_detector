  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of what it means to be part of the 'elect' or 'chosen ones' according to the Bible, supported by relevant scriptures and theological concepts. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the doctrine of election and its theological implications. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the sovereignty of God in the process of election, highlighting that it is ultimately God's decision and not based on human merit."
