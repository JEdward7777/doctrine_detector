  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer, referencing specific Bible verses and explaining the concept of being part of the 'elect' in detail. However, the teacher's reference answer emphasizes being set apart for holiness and bearing good spiritual fruit, which was not directly mentioned in the student's response. The student could have further emphasized the aspect of being chosen for holiness and the bearing of spiritual fruit to align more closely with the Christian worldview."
