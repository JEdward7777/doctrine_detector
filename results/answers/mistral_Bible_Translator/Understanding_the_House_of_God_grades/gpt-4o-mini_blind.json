  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the term \"house of God\" in the biblical context, covering both the physical structure aspect (Tabernacle, Temple, synagogues) and the metaphorical representation (community of believers). The student effectively ties in relevant scripture references to support their points and presents a well-rounded understanding of the concept. Great job in demonstrating a sound understanding of the topic and integrating key biblical passages."
