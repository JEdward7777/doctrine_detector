  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's response provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the term \"house of God\" in the Biblical context, covering both the physical structures and the metaphorical representation. They effectively connected the concept to divine worship, God's presence, and the community of believers, citing relevant biblical examples and verses. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the significance and meaning of 'house of God' in Scripture. However, the student's response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the importance of the tabernacle or temple as emphasized in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
