  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95/100\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive and well-articulated explanation of the characteristics that reflect the image of God in human beings according to the biblical definition. The student effectively references relevant biblical passages to support their points and covers a wide range of dimensions including spirituality, creativity, reason, moral understanding, relationship, and stewardship. However, to enhance the response further, it would be beneficial to explicitly mention aspects such as human dignity and free will, which are also key components of the imago Dei doctrine in Christian theology. Overall, well done."
