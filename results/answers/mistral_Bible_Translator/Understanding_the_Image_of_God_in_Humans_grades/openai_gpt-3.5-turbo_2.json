However, it lacks depth in exploring other significant aspects such as creativity, moral understanding, relationship and community, authority over creation, and the holistic nature of the imago Dei as outlined in the biblical account. Further elaboration on these aspects would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to be created in the image of God from a Christian worldview."
