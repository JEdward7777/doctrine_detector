  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a strong and comprehensive explanation of the significance of the term \"Kingdom of God\" in the New Testament. They have effectively described the dual nature of the Kingdom as both a present reality and a future hope, supported by relevant Biblical references. The explanation reflects a solid understanding of Christian theology and the eschatological aspects of the Kingdom of God. Well done!"
