It effectively addresses the concern of understanding God's sovereignty and authority in our lives by highlighting how the Kingdom of God represents God's rule in the hearts of believers and His ultimate reign over all creation. The inclusion of relevant Bible references further strengthens the explanation from a Christian worldview."
