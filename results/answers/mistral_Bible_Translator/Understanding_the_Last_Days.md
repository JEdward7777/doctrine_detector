## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In Christian eschatology, the "last days" is a term often used to refer to the time period leading up to the return of Jesus Christ, which is also known as his Second Coming. The concept is rooted in passages from both the Old Testament (e.g., Isaiah 2:2-4, Joel 2:28-32) and the New Testament (e.g., Acts 2:16-21, 2 Timothy 3:1-5, Hebrews 1:1-2).

In terms of Jesus' comings, it is important to distinguish between the First Coming and the Second Coming:

1. The First Coming refers to the historical event when Jesus Christ was born as a human in Bethlehem (Matthew 1:18-25, Luke 2:1-7).

2. The Second Coming, on the other hand, is a future event described in several biblical passages where Jesus will return to earth visibly and gloriously (Acts 1:9-11, Matthew 24:29-31, Revelation 1:7).

The 'last days' are often understood as the time period between the First Coming of Christ and his Second Coming, during which believers are called to remain faithful and live according to the teachings of Jesus. This period is also associated with increased trials, persecution, and false teaching (Matthew 24:4-14, 2 Peter 3:3-7).

It's important to note that interpretations of these events can vary among different Christian denominations and theologians. The exact nature of the 'last days,' including how long they will last, is a matter of ongoing theological debate.
