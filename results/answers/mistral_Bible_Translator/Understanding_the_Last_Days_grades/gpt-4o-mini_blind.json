  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of the concept of the \"last days\" in Christian eschatology and effectively distinguishes between Jesus' First and Second Comings. It accurately references relevant biblical passages and highlights the importance of remaining faithful during this period. The inclusion of the note on theological diversity concerning interpretations shows awareness of differing perspectives within Christianity. Overall, a well-rounded and doctrinally sound answer."
