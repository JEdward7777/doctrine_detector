  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer regarding the \"last days\" in relation to Jesus' first and second comings, citing relevant biblical passages and explaining the importance of understanding these concepts in Christian eschatology. The student's response is detailed and accurate, but it could have been improved by directly stating that the 'last days' refer to the time beginning with Jesus' first coming and ending with His second coming and the final day of judgment, as specified in the reference answer."
