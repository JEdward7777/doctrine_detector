1. Worshiping only God (Exodus 20:3-5): "You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them."

2. Not taking God's name in vain (Exodus 20:7): "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain."

3. Remembering the Sabbath day and keeping it holy (Exodus 20:8-11): "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work."

4. Honoring parents (Exodus 20:12): "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the LORD your God is giving you."

5. Not murdering (Exodus 20:13): "You shall not murder."

6. Not committing adultery (Exodus 20:14): "You shall not commit adultery."

7. Not stealing (Exodus 20:15): "You shall not steal."

8. Not bearing false witness against your neighbor (Exodus 20:16): "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."

9. Not coveting (Exodus 20:17): "You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's."

In addition to these, there are many other laws and commandments given throughout the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy that were part of God's covenant with the Israelites. These included laws concerning social justice, ritual purity, dietary restrictions, and festivals, among others.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response accurately identifies that the Law of Moses encompasses both the Ten Commandments and various other laws covering moral, ceremonial, and civil instructions for the Israelites. The inclusion of specific references to the Ten Commandments and the mention of additional laws from Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy demonstrates a solid understanding of the Old Testament laws. The mention of the laws' relevance today could have been explored further to provide a deeper analysis, hence the slight deduction in points. Overall, a well-informed response with room for additional insight.
