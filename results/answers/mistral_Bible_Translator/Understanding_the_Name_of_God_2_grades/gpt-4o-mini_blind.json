The reference to Exodus 3:14 is appropriate in highlighting the personal revelation of this name to Moses. Additionally, the mention of translations using \"LORD\" or \"Adonai\" for Yahweh shows an understanding of the textual variations. The suggestion to consider cultural context for a deeper understanding is commendable. Overall, a well-rounded and informative answer."
