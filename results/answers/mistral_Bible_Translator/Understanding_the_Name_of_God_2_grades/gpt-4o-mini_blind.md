## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Name_of_God_2.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of the Old Testament, the name "Yahweh" (also spelled as YHWH or Jehovah) is one of the names traditionally used to represent the God of Israel. The name is derived from the Hebrew verb "to be," indicating self-existence and eternity. The revelation of this name to Moses at the burning bush in Exodus 3:14 is a significant event, as it signifies the personal and intimate nature of the God who reveals himself to his people Israel.

In many translations, you may see "LORD" or "Adonai" used in place of Yahweh due to religious tradition. However, it's essential to remember that these titles are still representing the same divine being revealed to Moses and throughout the Old Testament. It's also worth noting that understanding the cultural context and historical background can greatly enrich our appreciation of the significance of God's name in the Old Testament.
