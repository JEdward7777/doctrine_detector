The emphasis on the personal and intimate nature of God's revelation through this name aligns well with a Christian worldview. The only minor suggestion for improvement would be to include a direct reference to the covenant aspect of God's name in relation to His people, to further strengthen the connection between God's name and His covenant relationship with His people."
