## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Name_of_God.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament, the name "Yahweh" (יהוה) holds immense significance as it is one of the names traditionally attributed to God. The four-letter Hebrew name (YHWH) is considered sacred and unpronounceable by some Jews due to religious traditions. The vowels used in modern Jewish and Christian Bibles to aid pronunciation are supplied based on translations into other languages, such as the Greek Septuagint or the Latin Vulgate.

The name Yahweh emphasizes God's self-revelation to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:14), where He identifies Himself as "I Am Who I Am" or "Yahweh," which means "He brings into existence, causes to become, or continues in being." This name highlights God's eternal and unchanging nature, emphasizing His self-existence, sovereignty, and faithfulness throughout history. Additionally, the name Yahweh often appears in conjunction with promises and covenants, symbolizing God's active involvement in the lives of His people and His commitment to fulfilling His promises.
