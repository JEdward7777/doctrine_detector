The student effectively explains how the imperfect judges of the Old Testament point to the need for a perfect Savior, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The references to specific biblical passages and the role of Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises add depth to the response. Overall, this answer is well-reasoned and provides a clear explanation supported by scripture. Great work!"
