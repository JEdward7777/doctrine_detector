  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as a 90.\n\nThe answer accurately distinguishes between the human spirit and evil spirits according to Biblical teachings. It acknowledges the divine origin and positive functions of the human spirit as well as the malevolent nature and opposition to God of evil spirits. The scriptural references provided support the points made in the response.\n\nHowever, to improve the answer further, it could delve deeper into the theological implications of the presence and influence of evil spirits in the world, perhaps by discussing the redemption and victory over evil through Jesus Christ. Expanding on the Biblical understanding of spiritual warfare and the power of God in overcoming evil would enhance the completeness of the response."
