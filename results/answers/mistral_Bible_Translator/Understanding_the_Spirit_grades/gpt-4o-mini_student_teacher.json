  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a solid explanation of the distinctions between the human spirit and evil spirits based on biblical references and characteristics. However, the student's response was slightly verbose and lacked direct simplicity in distinguishing personal spiritual identity from malevolent spiritual influences, as specified in the concern. The student could have honed in on the core differences more explicitly for a higher grade."
