# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 The Bible distinguishes between the human spirit and the concept of an evil spirit primarily through context, role, and characteristics.

The human spirit is often portrayed as the divine essence within humanity, given by God at creation (Genesis 2:7). It is responsible for life, intelligence, emotions, and connection with God. In most instances, it operates in a positive manner, enabling humans to have a relationship with God and carry out His will.

On the other hand, an evil spirit refers to supernatural beings (usually demons or unclean spirits) that oppose God and His purposes for humanity. These entities are often portrayed as causing distress, temptation, deception, sickness, and even possession in humans (e.g., Matthew 12:43-45; Mark 5:1-20). They are characterized by a strong desire to lead people away from God and His will.

It is essential to recognize that these spirits are not part of the nature of human beings but rather foreign entities, which can influence and afflict them. As Christians, we are called to resist such influences and live in obedience to God's will for our lives (Ephesians 6:10-20).
