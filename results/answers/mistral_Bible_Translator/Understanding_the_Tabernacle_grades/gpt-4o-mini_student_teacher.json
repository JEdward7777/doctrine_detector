  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive understanding of the purposes of the tabernacle for the Israelites during their time in the desert. They correctly identify key aspects such as worship, communication, unity, and guidance. However, the concern specified a specific focus on the tabernacle's role in the Israelites' relationship with God. The student could have delved deeper into how the tabernacle facilitated and symbolized this relationship more explicitly to align more closely with the teacher's reference answer."
