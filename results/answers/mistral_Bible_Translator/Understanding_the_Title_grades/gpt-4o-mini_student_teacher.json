  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 80.\n\nThe student demonstrated a strong understanding of the biblical and historical context surrounding the title \"Son of Man\" and its significance in Jesus' identity. They effectively discussed the Old Testament roots of the title, its interpretation in Jewish tradition, and Jesus' own use of the title to emphasize his authority and mission. However, the student's explanation did not explicitly address Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which is a key aspect of the teacher's reference answer. Emphasizing this dual nature would have enhanced the clarity and depth of the student's response."
