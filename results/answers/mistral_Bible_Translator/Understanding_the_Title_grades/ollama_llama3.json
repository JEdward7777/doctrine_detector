  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of summarizing the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" and its implications for our faith. It correctly identifies the title's emphasis on Jesus' dual nature, his role as Messiah, and his connection to humanity.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response could be more detailed and nuanced in its explanation. For example, it does not fully explore the Old Testament context of the phrase \"Son of Man\" or its development in Jewish apocalyptic tradition. Additionally, while the response mentions Jesus' role as Messiah, it could delve deeper into the Christological implications of this title for our faith.\n\nOverall, I would say that the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man,\" but could benefit from further development and nuance."
