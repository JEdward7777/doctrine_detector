  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' by delving into its Biblical context, Jewish interpretation, Jesus' teachings, and Christological implications. The student effectively connects the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine to His role as the Messiah and his connection to humanity, demonstrating a solid understanding of the theological implications of this title within a Christian worldview. The only area for improvement could be to provide more specific references to additional biblical verses or theological concepts to further strengthen the argument."
