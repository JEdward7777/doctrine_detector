# Answer by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, the title "Son of Man" (Greek: "huios tou anthropou") is a significant self-designation used by Jesus. It has multiple layers of meaning, derived from both Old Testament prophetic literature and Jewish apocalyptic tradition.

1. Biblical Context: The title appears in the Book of Daniel, where it refers to a figure who will come with the clouds of heaven, receive dominion, glory, and a kingdom (Daniel 7:13-14). This Messianic figure is described as "one like a son of man" (Daniel 7:13).
2. Jewish Interpretation: By Jesus' time, Jewish interpreters saw the Son of Man in Daniel as a reference to the Messiah or the Suffering Servant prophesied in Isaiah 53. It is likely that Jesus was referring to himself when he used this title.
3. Jesus' Teachings: In the Gospels, Jesus uses "Son of Man" to emphasize his authority and mission. He often refers to future events (e.g., Matthew 19:28; Mark 14:62) but also speaks of his present ministry (e.g., John 5:27). The title serves as a reminder that Jesus is both fully human (the Son) and divine (the Man).
4. Christological Implications: The title "Son of Man" became an important aspect of early Christian theology, highlighting Jesus' humanity, his messianic role, and his divine authority. It contributed to the development of Jesus' identity as the promised Messiah and the Son of God.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' by delving into its Biblical context, Jewish interpretation, Jesus' teachings, and Christological implications. The student effectively connects the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine to His role as the Messiah and his connection to humanity, demonstrating a solid understanding of the theological implications of this title within a Christian worldview. The only area for improvement could be to provide more specific references to additional biblical verses or theological concepts to further strengthen the argument.
