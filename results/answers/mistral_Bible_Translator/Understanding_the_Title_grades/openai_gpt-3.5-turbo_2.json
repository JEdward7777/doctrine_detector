It effectively captures the dual nature of Jesus as fully human and fully divine and highlights the implications of this title for Christian faith. Additionally, it connects this theological concept to Jesus' messianic role and his connection to humanity. The response could be further strengthened by exploring specific biblical passages where Jesus uses the title 'Son of Man' and how they deepen our understanding of His identity and mission."
