It effectively connects the title to Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity. The only suggestion for improvement would be to further explore how understanding Jesus as the \"Son of Man\" impacts personal faith in Him as both Savior and Lord."
