It effectively explains how this title signifies Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His connection to humanity, addressing the concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' and its implications for our faith from a Christian worldview. Well done!"
