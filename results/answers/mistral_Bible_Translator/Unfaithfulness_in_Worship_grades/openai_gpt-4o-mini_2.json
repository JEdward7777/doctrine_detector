The incorporation of specific biblical examples adds depth to the explanation. However, the response could have further connected these instances to the implications of unfaithfulness in a believer's relationship with God from a Christian perspective, such as highlighting the importance of repentance, restoration, and the need for faithful worship and obedience in maintaining a close relationship with God."
