  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as follows:\n\nGrade: 90\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive list of consequences that God pronounces on ungodly people according to the Christian Bible. The cited passages are relevant and support the points made about the consequences of disobedience and rejection of God. However, the answer could be improved by further elaborating on the concept of repentance and the possibility of reconciliation with God even after facing consequences for ungodliness. Additionally, connecting the consequences to the overarching theme of God's justice and mercy would enhance the depth of the response."
