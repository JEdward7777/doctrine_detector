 According to the Christian Bible, there are several consequences that God has pronounced upon ungodly people throughout the Scriptures. Here are a few examples:

1. Genesis 6:3 - "My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years." This passage shows that in the time of Noah, God decided to limit human life span due to the wickedness of humanity.

2. Leviticus 18:24-28 - This passage describes the consequences for disobeying God's commands regarding sexual immorality, stating that the land would vomit out its inhabitants and they would be scattered among the nations.

3. Deuteronomy 28 - This entire chapter is a series of blessings and curses, listing the consequences for obedience and disobedience to God's commands. The consequences for disobedience include famine, disease, defeat in battle, and ultimately exile from the Promised Land.

4. Jeremiah 15:1-6 - In this passage, God pronounces a curse on the ungodly who have rejected Him, stating that they will be cut off from the land and consumed by pestilence and famine.

5. Matthew 7:21-23 - In the New Testament, Jesus speaks of those who call Him "Lord" but do not practice righteousness, saying that on the Day of Judgment they will be told to depart from Him because they did not know Him.

6. Revelation 20:11-15 - In the book of Revelation, there is a description of the final judgment where ungodly people are thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone to be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

I would grade this answer as follows:

Grade: 90

Comment: The answer provides a comprehensive list of consequences that God pronounces on ungodly people according to the Christian Bible. The cited passages are relevant and support the points made about the consequences of disobedience and rejection of God. However, the answer could be improved by further elaborating on the concept of repentance and the possibility of reconciliation with God even after facing consequences for ungodliness. Additionally, connecting the consequences to the overarching theme of God's justice and mercy would enhance the depth of the response.
