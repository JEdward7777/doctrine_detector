The examples given from both scripture demonstrate a clear delineation of how the term is used in relation to God in the Old Testament and Jesus Christ in the New Testament. The explanation of God's unique, transcendent nature in the Old Testament and Christ's sinless nature in the New Testament is doctrinally sound. Additionally, the chosen verses effectively illustrate the concept being discussed. Overall, this is a well-written and insightful response."
