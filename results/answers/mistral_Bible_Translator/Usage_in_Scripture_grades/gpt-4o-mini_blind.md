## [Answer](../Usage_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible), the term "Holy One" is primarily applied to God, reflecting His unique, transcendent, and set-apart nature. This title underscores God's otherness, purity, and moral perfection that distinguish Him from all creation.

Here are a few examples:

1. Isaiah 1:4 (ESV) - "From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is nothing sound in it; wounds and bruises are found throughout your whole body, and contempt for the Holy One of Israel is found in your land."

2. Psalm 71:22 (NIV) - "Now my heart's delight is in You; My horn from this very day I shall lift up in Your salvation."

3. Daniel 9:7 (KJV) - "Unto Thee, even unto Thee, O Lord, are due all the words of righteousness, and all the praise unto Thy name, for Thou art righteous: thou only art holy; thou art the LORD."

In the New Testament (Christian Greek Scriptures), Jesus Christ is often referred to as "Holy One" or "Holy of Holies," highlighting His sinless nature and perfect relationship with God. This title emphasizes Christ's unique role as the embodiment of God on earth and His redemptive mission:

1. John 6:69 (ESV) - "We have come to believe and to know that You are the Holy One of God."

2. Acts 3:14 (NIV) - "But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you."

3. Revelation 11:18 (KJV) - "And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the Holy ones, and to them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth."

Overall, the term "Holy One" in both testaments emphasizes God's unique character as set apart from all creation, expressing His moral purity and righteousness.
