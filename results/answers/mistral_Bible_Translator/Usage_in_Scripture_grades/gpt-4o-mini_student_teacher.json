  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-researched answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments. They effectively draw on specific biblical references to support their explanations. However, the student could improve their answer by explicitly linking the term \"Holy One\" to the authority and divinity of Jesus in the New Testament, as specified in the concern. They have provided relevant verses but could have elaborated more on how these references highlight Jesus' authority and divinity. Despite this minor oversight, the student has shown a strong comprehension of the concept and its significance within a Christian worldview."
