It effectively connects the use of myrrh to anointing the deceased and symbolizing respect for the dead. The reference to myrrh in the story of Joseph's embalming and the gifts brought to Jesus by the wise men demonstrates a strong understanding of the cultural and spiritual significance of myrrh in biblical contexts. The response could have further strengthened its Christian perspective by explicitly highlighting the symbolic importance of myrrh in representing the bitterness of death and hope in the presence of God."
