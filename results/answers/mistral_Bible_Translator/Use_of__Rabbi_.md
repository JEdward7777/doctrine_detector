## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the New Testament, neither John the Baptist nor Jesus Christ was explicitly addressed as "Rabbi" during their ministries. The term "Rabbi" (רַבִּי in Hebrew) is often translated as "Teacher" or "Master" in English Bibles and denotes a learned teacher in Judaism.

John the Baptist was referred to as John the Baptist (Iōannēs ho baptistēs in Greek), the son of Zacharias, and the prophet who prepared the way for Jesus Christ. He did not hold any formal position within the religious system of his day, and thus he was not addressed as "Rabbi."

Jesus Christ was recognized by His disciples as Rabbi (Μαθητεύου, Matheteuou) but primarily during their private interactions or conversations. The Gospels record the crowds addressing Jesus with various titles such as Teacher (Διδάσκαλε), Lord (Κύριε), Master (Παιδάριον), Son of David, and Son of God, but they do not use the title "Rabbi." In fact, Jesus frequently distinguished Himself from the religious leaders of His day who were addressed as Rabbi.

It's important to note that Jesus was a Rabbi in a broader sense, being a teacher who imparted wisdom and knowledge. However, during His earthly ministry, He did not use or accept the title "Rabbi" as it was commonly understood at the time.
