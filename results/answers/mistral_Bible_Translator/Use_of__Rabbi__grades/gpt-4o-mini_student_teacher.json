While they correctly discussed the broader understanding of the term and the various titles used to address Jesus, they did not address the specific concern of recognizing the respect and authority associated with Jesus' and John's teachings in relation to the title \"Rabbi.\" The response could have been improved by highlighting the significance of being called \"Rabbi\" by their disciples as an acknowledgement of their teaching authority."
