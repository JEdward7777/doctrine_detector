  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the text and clearly articulates the absence of explicit references to \"Rabbi\" in the New Testament concerning both John the Baptist and Jesus Christ. The inclusion of relevant examples from the Gospels supports the claims made. Additionally, the student acknowledges the broader sense in which Jesus was a teacher but clarifies the specific context in which the title \"Rabbi\" was commonly used at the time."
