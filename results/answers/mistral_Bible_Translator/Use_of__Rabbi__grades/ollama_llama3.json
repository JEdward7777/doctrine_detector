  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by recognizing that Jesus was referred to as \"Rabbi\" by His disciples, indicating His role as a teacher. However, it does not accurately reflect John's relationship with Jesus or the broader context surrounding the use of the title \"Rabbi\". The statement also lacks specificity and nuance in its understanding of Jesus' role as a teacher.\n\nThe response scores higher than 0 because it acknowledges that Jesus was referred to as \"Rabbi\" by His disciples, but it loses points for not fully capturing the complexity and accuracy of the biblical accounts."
