It provides a thorough explanation of how the title \"Rabbi\" was not explicitly used for John the Baptist or Jesus in the New Testament, highlighting the different titles and distinctions used in addressing them. The response could be further strengthened by connecting the respect and authority associated with their teachings to their divine nature and unique roles within the Christian worldview."
