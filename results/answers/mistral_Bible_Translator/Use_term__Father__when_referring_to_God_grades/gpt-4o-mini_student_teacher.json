However, there is a concern that the student's suggestion to use inclusive language, while well-intentioned, may dilute the scriptural message regarding God's nature as Father. Emphasizing the importance of preserving theological truths and relying on teaching and context to clarify misunderstandings as the reference answer indicates would have strengthened the student's argument."
