However, the response also considers the need for inclusive language to prevent misunderstandings and promote inclusivity. While it suggests balancing theological truths and inclusivity, it could have emphasized more strongly the significance of the term \"Father\" in reflecting the relational aspect of God without diluting the scriptural message."
