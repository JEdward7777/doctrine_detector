It also suggests relying on teaching and context to address potential misunderstandings regarding God's gender. While the response demonstrates a sound understanding of the concern, it could further emphasize the significance of upholding biblical truths while also striving for inclusivity in language, which is a valid consideration in modern translations. Integrating these aspects more explicitly would strengthen the overall argument."
