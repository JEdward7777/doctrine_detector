  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from Revelation about the defeat of Satan in the eschatological context, demonstrating a strong understanding of Christian beliefs regarding Satan's ultimate defeat. However, the reference answer specifically mentions the promise of the Messiah defeating Satan completely, which was not directly addressed in the student's response. The student could have strengthened their answer by incorporating this foundational promise related to the defeat of Satan through Eve's descendant, the Messiah."
