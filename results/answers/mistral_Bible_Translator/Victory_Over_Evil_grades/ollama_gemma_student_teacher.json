  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the biblical promise regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan. They accurately referenced Revelation 20:1-3 and provided a clear explanation of the events that will transpire during the final triumph of God. The student's response also highlights the significance of this promise within Christian eschatology. However, it would benefit from a more explicit connection to the promised descendant of Eve, as suggested in the reference answer."
