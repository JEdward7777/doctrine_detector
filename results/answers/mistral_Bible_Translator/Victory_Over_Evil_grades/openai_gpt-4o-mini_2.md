## Question [Victory Over Evil](../../../questions/Victory_Over_Evil.md)
What promise does God give regarding the ultimate defeat of Satan?

## Correct Answer
God promised that one of Eveâ€™s descendants, referring to the Messiah, would defeat Satan completely and crush his power forever.

## Stated Concern
This promise offers hope and assurance to Christians about God's sovereignty and the eventual triumph over evil.

## [Answer](../Victory_Over_Evil.md) by [mistral Bible Translator](../../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 As a Christian Bible translator, I would reference Revelation 20:1-3, where it is stated that after the thousand-year reign of Christ on earth (described in Revelation 20:4-6), Satan will be released for a short time. However, he will then be decisively defeated and permanently banished, along with death and the grave. This event marks the final triumph of God and His people, leading to the eternal state, where there will no longer be any more pain, sorrow, or death (Revelation 21:4). This promise of Satan's ultimate defeat is an essential aspect of Christian eschatology, reflecting the hope that evil will eventually be vanquished, and God's reign will prevail forever.

Comment: The response effectively builds upon the initial answer by providing biblical references and elaborating on the ultimate defeat of Satan in Christian eschatology. It emphasizes the hope and assurance Christians derive from the promise of Satan's permanent banishment and God's final triumph over evil. The incorporation of additional scriptural support enhances the depth and clarity of the explanation, aligning well with the concern provided.
