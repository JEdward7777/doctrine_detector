It effectively addressed the concern by explaining how this victory impacts believers' spiritual lives, emphasizing the importance of accepting Christ as Savior, resisting temptation, and remaining obedient to God. The incorporation of relevant biblical references further strengthened the argument from a Christian worldview perspective. However, to enhance the response, additional discussion on the ongoing spiritual battle believers face and the need for spiritual armor as mentioned in Ephesians 6:10-18 could have been beneficial."
