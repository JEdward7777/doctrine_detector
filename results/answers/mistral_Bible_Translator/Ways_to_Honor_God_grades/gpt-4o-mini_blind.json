  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and doctrinally sound list of practical ways Christians can honor God in their daily lives. The suggestions align with Christian beliefs and emphasize the importance of prayer, Bible reading, living according to biblical principles, sharing faith, serving others, stewardship, regular worship, integrity, forgiveness, and loving others. The inclusion of scriptural references and central Christian teachings enhances the depth and accuracy of the response. Well done."
