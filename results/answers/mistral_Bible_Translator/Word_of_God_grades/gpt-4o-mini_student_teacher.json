  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the term \"Word of God\" according to Christian theology, incorporating various aspects such as Jesus Christ as the Logos, the Scriptures, prophetic utterances, and oral traditions. The answer demonstrates a solid grasp of the scope and significance of God's communication to humanity. However, there was slight extra information included beyond the reference answer, which is why it falls slightly below a perfect score."
