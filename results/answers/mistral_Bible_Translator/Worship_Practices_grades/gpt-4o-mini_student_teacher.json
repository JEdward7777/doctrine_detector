  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and thoughtful list of modern examples of idols that Christians might unintentionally worship instead of the one true God. They included various aspects of life that can easily become idols and explained how they can affect one's relationship with God. However, the student's answer was quite detailed and covered a wide range of potential idols, which is commendable. The student effectively addressed the concern by emphasizing the importance of prioritizing God above all else in one's life. Great job overall!"
