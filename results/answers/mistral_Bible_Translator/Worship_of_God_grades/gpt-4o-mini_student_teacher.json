  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-supported answer using biblical references to explain why humans were created to worship God and the consequences of worshiping false gods. They effectively highlighted the importance of glorifying God and avoiding idolatry based on Christian teachings. However, the student could have been more succinct in relating the essence of worshiping the true God to the dangers of idolatry, as emphasized in the reference answer."
