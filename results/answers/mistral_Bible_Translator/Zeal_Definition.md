## Answer given by [mistral Bible Translator](../../answering_models/mistral_Bible_Translator.md)
 In the context of Christian teachings, 'zeal' refers to an intense eagerness and dedication to serving God, living according to His commandments, and promoting righteousness. It is a fervent passion for spiritual matters, often demonstrated through devotion to prayer, study of Scripture, good works, and the spreading of the Gospel message. Zeal is not just about being zealous oneself, but also about caring deeply for others to bring them to knowledge of God's love and salvation.

Zeal is mentioned several times in the Bible as a desirable quality. For example, in Romans 12:11, Paul encourages believers to "not lagging in zeal, be ardent in spirit," while in Galatians 4:18, he expresses concern that the Galatian churches' zeal is being misdirected and advises them to be restored to a sincere and steadfast devotion to Christ.

However, it's important to remember that zeal without knowledge can lead to incorrect or harmful actions (Hosea 6:6), so zeal should always be guided by the wisdom found in Scripture and informed by God's love for all people. As believers strive to live with zeal, they must also seek to imitate Jesus' perfect balance of love, compassion, and righteousness (Matthew 22:37-40).
