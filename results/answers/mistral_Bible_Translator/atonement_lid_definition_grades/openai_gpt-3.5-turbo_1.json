It effectively relates the symbolic representation of God's mercy and atonement in the atonement lid and ties it to the ultimate redemption brought by Jesus Christ. The explanation is clear, detailed, and demonstrates a good understanding of the Christian worldview in interpreting Old Testament symbolism. Great job!"
