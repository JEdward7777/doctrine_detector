  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response is informative about Islamic perspectives on the concept of the \"Abomination of Desolation,\" but it does not address the Christian interpretation provided in the reference answer. The concern emphasizes the importance of understanding prophetic warnings in the Bible, which the student's answer fails to acknowledge. Integrating the Christian perspective on the significance of defiling God's sacred spaces from a biblical perspective would have improved the response."
