## [Answer](../Abomination_of_Desolation.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic scholarship, the concept of the "Abomination of Desolation" (Shaitan al-Quds) is not directly linked to the events and prophecies in the Gospel according to Matthew 24:15. Instead, it refers to an event mentioned in a Hadith narrated by Ibn 'Abbas, where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is reported to have said that the Dajjal (Antichrist) would break the cross, kill pigs, and forbid prayer in churches before the Day of Judgment. This is considered the "Abomination of Desolation" in Islamic context.

However, it's essential to note that Muslims believe that Jesus (Isa PBUH) did not predict his own second coming as some Christian scholars interpret Matthew 24:15. Instead, Muslims believe that Jesus will return on the Day of Judgment as one of the signs announced by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

This is a sensitive topic that requires careful understanding and consideration, taking into account the various perspectives and beliefs within both Islamic and Christian communities. It's always recommended to seek knowledge from reliable scholars and sources in order to gain a deeper comprehension of such complex topics.
