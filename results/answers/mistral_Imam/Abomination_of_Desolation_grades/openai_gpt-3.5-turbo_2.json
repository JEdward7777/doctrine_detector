However, the response falls short in directly addressing the concern about defiling God's sacred spaces and understanding prophetic warnings in the Bible from a Christian worldview. It would have been beneficial to provide a perspective on the importance of respecting sacred spaces in both Islam and Christianity, while also acknowledging and respecting the differences in beliefs between the two faiths. Further elaboration on understanding and interpreting biblical prophecies within a Christian context would have strengthened the response."
