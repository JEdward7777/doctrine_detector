  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation about the Kaaba in Islam and its significance, but the answer did not address the specific concern about recognizing the holiness of God and the protocols for approaching Him in the context of the 'most holy place'. The student did not mention the restriction of only the high priest being permitted to enter the 'most holy place' in Christian beliefs. The response focused more on the inclusivity and significance of the Kaaba in Islam rather than the distinct Christian perspective on the 'most holy place'."
