However, while it emphasizes equality, unity, spiritual renewal, and remembrance of Prophet Ibrahim, it does not directly address the concerns raised about the holiness of God and the protocols for approaching Him as compared to the Christian perspective of access to the holy place through the high priest. Integrating a discussion on the unique Christian understanding of the role of the high priest in facilitating access to God's presence would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective in this evaluation."
