However, from a Christian worldview concerned with recognizing the holiness of God and the necessary protocols for approaching Him, the response lacks acknowledgement of the uniqueness of Jesus Christ as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity. While the principles of equality and unity are commendable, a Christian perspective would highlight the exclusive role of Jesus as the High Priest who enables believers to approach God through His sacrifice."
