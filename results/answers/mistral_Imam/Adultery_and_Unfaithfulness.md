## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, the term 'unfaithful' (in this context, referred to as "Zina") refers to extramarital sexual relations, which includes adultery and fornication. This concept is deeply rooted in the Quran and Hadith, where it is considered a grave sin with severe consequences.

In terms of marriage, 'unfaithfulness' disrupts the harmony, trust, and commitment that should exist between spouses. It goes against one of the fundamental purposes of marriage, which is to protect and safeguard each other's honor and chastity.

The Quran states in Chapter 24 (An-Nur), verse 2: "And those who launch a charge against chaste women and do not produce four witnesses, lest they should be confined for the sin they have uttered, or be made to pay the penalty of a large fine. But it shall be prevented from their kin by acceptable redemption. And those are indeed the people of adultery, who will never be successful."

This verse emphasizes the importance of evidence and witnesses in cases related to unfaithfulness, stressing the need for fairness and justice in such matters. It also underscores the gravity of this offense within Islamic teachings.
