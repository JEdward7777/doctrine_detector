  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a strong analysis of the term 'unfaithful' in the context of marriage and relates it effectively to both Islamic teachings and Israel's unfaithfulness to God. The inclusion of the Quranic verse and its emphasis on evidence and justice further strengthens the argument. The connection made between loyalty and faithfulness in spiritual and marital commitments is well articulated and supported. Overall, a well-written and insightful response that aligns with the concern provided."
