However, it falls short in addressing the Christian-specific context of Passover, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding. Additionally, the inclusion of the Muslim perspective, while informative, is not directly relevant to the question posed. The explanation would benefit from a deeper exploration of the theological significance of Passover within Christianity."
