However, the Christian concern provided is not fully addressed in the response. In the Christian faith, remembrance is crucial, not just for historical events but also for the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins. The response could have related the importance of remembrance in Passover to the concept of remembrance in Christian faith more explicitly."
