## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious practices. However, I can help explain religious texts based on the information available to me. In this case, we are discussing the celebration of Passover in the context of the Bible from a Muslim perspective, as you've asked an Imam.

The observance of Passover (Pesach in Hebrew) is one of the Jewish holidays commemorating the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery around 1270 BCE. According to the book of Exodus (12:1-14), God instructed Moses and Aaron to tell Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go, threatening seven plagues upon Egypt if he refused. When Pharaoh did not comply, the tenth and final plague was the death of all firstborn sons in Egypt.

To protect their firstborn sons, the Israelites were commanded to mark the doorposts of their houses with the blood of a slaughtered lamb (Exodus 12:7-13). This practice is known as the Passover sacrifice. The Angel of Death passed over these marked homes, sparing their firstborns.

After the Exodus, God commanded the Israelites to celebrate Passover every year in remembrance of this miraculous event (Exodus 12:14). This holiday serves as a reminder of the deliverance from bondage and the covenant between God and His chosen people. In addition, it is a time for families to come together, share the story, and reaffirm their faith in God.

It is important to note that Islam recognizes Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as prophets of Allah, and the story of Moses (Musa) and his people is an essential part of Islamic history. However, Muslims do not observe Passover as a religious holiday but celebrate the life and prophethood of Moses in their own religious practices.

Comment: The response accurately describes the significance of Passover for the Israelites in remembering God's victory over the Egyptians and their deliverance from slavery. However, the Christian concern provided is not fully addressed in the response. In the Christian faith, remembrance is crucial, not just for historical events but also for the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins. The response could have related the importance of remembrance in Passover to the concept of remembrance in Christian faith more explicitly.
