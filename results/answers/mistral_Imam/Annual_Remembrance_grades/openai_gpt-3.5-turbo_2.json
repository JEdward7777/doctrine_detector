However, from a Christian perspective that emphasizes the importance of remembrance in faith, the explanation falls short by not highlighting the deeper theological implications of Passover in relation to the Christian faith, such as its foreshadowing of Christ as the ultimate Passover Lamb who delivers believers from sin and spiritual slavery. Incorporating this Christian perspective would have strengthened the response."
