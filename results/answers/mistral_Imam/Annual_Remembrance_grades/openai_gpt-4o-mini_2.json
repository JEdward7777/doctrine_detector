However, from a Christian perspective, there is a missed opportunity to draw parallels between the Passover celebration and the concept of remembrance in Christian faith. In Christianity, remembrance is central to the faith, especially in the celebration of the Eucharist where believers commemorate the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. A stronger connection to Christian theology and the importance of remembrance in the context of Passover would have enhanced the response."
