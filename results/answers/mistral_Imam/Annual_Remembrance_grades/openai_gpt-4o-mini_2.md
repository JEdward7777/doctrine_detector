## [Answer](../Annual_Remembrance.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious practices. However, I can help explain religious texts based on the information available to me. In this case, we are discussing the celebration of Passover in the context of the Bible from a Muslim perspective, as you've asked an Imam.

The observance of Passover (Pesach in Hebrew) is one of the Jewish holidays commemorating the liberation of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery around 1270 BCE. According to the book of Exodus (12:1-14), God instructed Moses and Aaron to tell Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go, threatening seven plagues upon Egypt if he refused. When Pharaoh did not comply, the tenth and final plague was the death of all firstborn sons in Egypt.

To protect their firstborn sons, the Israelites were commanded to mark the doorposts of their houses with the blood of a slaughtered lamb (Exodus 12:7-13). This practice is known as the Passover sacrifice. The Angel of Death passed over these marked homes, sparing their firstborns.

After the Exodus, God commanded the Israelites to celebrate Passover every year in remembrance of this miraculous event (Exodus 12:14). This holiday serves as a reminder of the deliverance from bondage and the covenant between God and His chosen people. In addition, it is a time for families to come together, share the story, and reaffirm their faith in God.

It is important to note that Islam recognizes Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as prophets of Allah, and the story of Moses (Musa) and his people is an essential part of Islamic history. However, Muslims do not observe Passover as a religious holiday but celebrate the life and prophethood of Moses in their own religious practices.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the significance of Passover in Jewish tradition, touching on the biblical story and its importance for the Israelites. However, from a Christian perspective, there is a missed opportunity to draw parallels between the Passover celebration and the concept of remembrance in Christian faith. In Christianity, remembrance is central to the faith, especially in the celebration of the Eucharist where believers commemorate the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. A stronger connection to Christian theology and the importance of remembrance in the context of Passover would have enhanced the response.
