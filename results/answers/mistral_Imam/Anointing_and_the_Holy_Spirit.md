## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic terminology, the concept of receiving the "Holy Spirit" is not directly analogous to the Christian context of anointing. The Quran and Hadith do mention the term "ruh," which can be translated as spirit, but it does not carry the same connotations as in Christianity regarding a divine presence or guidance.

In Islam, ruh is believed to be God's essence within every living being, providing life and consciousness. However, this concept is distinct from the Christian understanding of the Holy Spirit, which is understood to be a divine person of the Trinity who guides believers and bestows spiritual gifts.

The practice of anointing in Islam, when it occurs, is primarily associated with rituals such as the Wudu (ablution) or the application of oil on the body for healing purposes rather than as a means to receive divine guidance or grace.

It's important to remember that each faith has its unique traditions and beliefs, and they should be respected as such. In Islamic theology, the source of guidance and wisdom is solely God, revealed through the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).
