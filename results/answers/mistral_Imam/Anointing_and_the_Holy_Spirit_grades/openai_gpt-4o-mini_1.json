However, the explanation predominantly focuses on the Islamic perspective, lacking a detailed exploration of how anointing empowers Christians through the Holy Spirit. More discussion on the empowering aspect of anointing in relation to the Holy Spirit within a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
