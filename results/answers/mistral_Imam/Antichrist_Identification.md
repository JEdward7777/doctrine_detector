## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, in a Muslim context, it is important to note that the concept of the Antichrist (Dajjal) comes from Islamic eschatology, not from the apostle John in the Bible. In Islam, the Dajjal will appear before the Day of Judgment and deceive many people by pretending to bring peace and prosperity. He will have physical characteristics that can be easily identified, such as having only one eye, being extremely short, or having a large head and thin legs. Unlike the biblical Antichrist, the Dajjal is not considered to be the second coming of Jesus (peace be upon him). For authentic religious information, it is always best to consult Islamic scholars or reliable religious sources.
