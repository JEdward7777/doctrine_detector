  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: The response correctly points out that the concept of the Antichrist (Dajjal) comes from Islamic eschatology and not from the apostle John in the Bible. However, since the question specifically asks about the apostle John's definition of an antichrist, the answer does not directly address the biblical perspective. It would have been more appropriate to explain John's teachings on what defines a person as an antichrist from a Christian worldview. The response also includes references to Islamic beliefs, which are not relevant to the question asked. Overall, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness in relation to the apostle John's teachings on the topic."
