## Question [Antichrist Identification](../../../questions/Antichrist_Identification.md)
According to the apostle John, what defines a person as an antichrist?

## Correct Answer
A person is identified as an antichrist if they deceive people by saying that Jesus is not the Messiah or by denying that Jesus is both God and human.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the traits of antichrists helps Christians recognize and resist false teachings.

## [Answer](../Antichrist_Identification.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, in a Muslim context, it is important to note that the concept of the Antichrist (Dajjal) comes from Islamic eschatology, not from the apostle John in the Bible. In Islam, the Dajjal will appear before the Day of Judgment and deceive many people by pretending to bring peace and prosperity. He will have physical characteristics that can be easily identified, such as having only one eye, being extremely short, or having a large head and thin legs. Unlike the biblical Antichrist, the Dajjal is not considered to be the second coming of Jesus (peace be upon him). For authentic religious information, it is always best to consult Islamic scholars or reliable religious sources.

Grade: 40

Comments: The response correctly points out that the concept of the Antichrist (Dajjal) comes from Islamic eschatology and not from the apostle John in the Bible. However, since the question specifically asks about the apostle John's definition of an antichrist, the answer does not directly address the biblical perspective. It would have been more appropriate to explain John's teachings on what defines a person as an antichrist from a Christian worldview. The response also includes references to Islamic beliefs, which are not relevant to the question asked. Overall, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness in relation to the apostle John's teachings on the topic.
