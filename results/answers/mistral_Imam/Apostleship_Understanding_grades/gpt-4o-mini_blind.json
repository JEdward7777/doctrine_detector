However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to clarify that Jesus is not just a messenger but the Son of God and part of the Trinity. The response could have emphasized more on the apostles' role in spreading the message of salvation through Jesus Christ and the establishment of the early church. Additionally, the mention of Islam's beliefs could have been more clearly delineated from the Christian perspective to avoid confusion in the comparison of beliefs. Further scriptural references would have strengthened the answer."
