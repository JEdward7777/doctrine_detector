The connection to the context of the Great Commission is evident, emphasizing the importance of their mission in carrying out Jesus's mandate to go and make disciples of all nations. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the specific authority and commission given to the apostles by Jesus in the context of the Great Commission. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, it would be important to address the apostles as foundational for the continuation of Christ's ministry on earth through the Holy Spirit."
