  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response on how Christians can apply the principle of reconciliation to their relationships with others from a biblical perspective. They highlighted key teachings such as forgiveness, love thy neighbor, turning the other cheek, mediation and restoration, and grace, all of which align with Christian principles. While the student's answer was thorough and insightful, it could have been improved by focusing more on simplicity and directly addressing the concern of understanding the practical implications of reconciliation in daily life. Additionally, aligning the response more closely with the reference answer provided by the teacher would help strengthen the student's understanding of the Christian worldview on reconciliation."
