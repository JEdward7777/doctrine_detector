## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, there is no explicit term "archangel" used for one specific angel. The concept of an archangel as a rank or title above other angels does not appear in the Bible. However, the Angel of the Lord (who appears in Genesis 16:7-14, 22:11-18, and Exodus 3:2-4) is sometimes interpreted by some Christian scholars as a high-ranking angel or even as a manifestation of God Himself. This figure is not specifically referred to as an "archangel" in the Bible.

In Islam, we have a belief that angels are distinct entities, unlike human beings, and they do not hold ranks similar to those found in human societies. Angels carry out the will of Allah (God) without question or deviation. The most well-known angels in Islamic tradition are Jibril (Gabriel), Mikail (Michael), Israfil (Raphael), and Munkar and Nakir, among others. These angels have specific roles and responsibilities, but Islam does not recognize an "archangel" as such.
