However, it incorrectly states that there is no explicit term \"archangel\" used for one specific angel in the Bible. The Bible actually does refer to the archangel Michael in Jude 1:9. Additionally, the answer's focus on Islamic beliefs about angels is not directly relevant to the question about the Bible. The response could benefit from more precise and accurate information on the topic of archangels in Christianity."
