While it is true that the concept of archangels is not extensively discussed in the Bible, the correct answer is that Michael is the only angel explicitly referred to as an archangel in the Bible. The discussion on angels in Islam, while informative, is not directly relevant to the specific question asked. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to accurately understand and recognize the role of Michael as the archangel in order to grasp the spiritual significance and authority associated with him in spiritual warfare and intercession."
