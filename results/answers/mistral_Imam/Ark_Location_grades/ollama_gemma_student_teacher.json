They clearly explain that the Ark of the Covenant is a Jewish artifact and that it is not explicitly mentioned in Islamic traditions. However, the answer could have benefited from acknowledging the relevance of the Tabernacle in Christian theology and providing some elaboration on the significance of the most holy place in Christianity."
