# Question [Assurance of Salvation](../../../questions/Assurance_of_Salvation.md)
What assurance is given to those who believe in Jesus?

# Correct Answer
If you believe in Jesus and what He has done for you, you are a Christian, and God has forgiven your sins because of what Jesus did.

# Stated Concern
Reassuring believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus.

# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we recognize and revere Jesus (peace be upon him) as one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity. The Quran confirms his virgin birth, miracles, and his status as a messenger of God (Al-Imran 3:45-49).

For those who believe in Jesus within an Islamic context, they are assured that they will receive the same rewards promised to all believers. They will be granted Paradise if they follow the teachings of Islam and fulfill their duties as Muslims. This includes the Five Pillars of Islam: Shahada (the declaration of faith), Salah (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting during Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah).

It is important to note that while Muslims believe in Jesus, our understanding differs from some Christian beliefs. We do not believe that Jesus is the son of God in a literal sense; rather, we view him as a messenger and a servant of Allah.

In summary, those who believe in Jesus within Islam are assured that they will receive the same rewards as all believers, but their understanding and practice of faith should be consistent with Islamic teachings.

Grade: 30

Comment: While the response provides a clear Christian perspective on salvation through faith in Jesus, the concern is not addressed within an Islamic context. The response discusses Islamic beliefs about Jesus but does not directly reassure believers of their salvation through faith in Jesus from a Christian worldview.
