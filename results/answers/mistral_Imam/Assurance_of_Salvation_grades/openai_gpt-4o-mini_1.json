However, from a Christian worldview, the key aspect of salvation through faith in Jesus as the Son of God and Savior was not addressed or affirmed. In Christianity, salvation is not based on following religious duties or pillars, but on faith in Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice for sins. It would be important to emphasize the unique Christian belief in Jesus as the Son of God who offers forgiveness of sins through His death and resurrection for a more comprehensive response."
