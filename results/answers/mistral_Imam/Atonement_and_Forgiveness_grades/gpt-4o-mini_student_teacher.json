They emphasized the importance of forgiveness in atonement and the restoration of relationships with God and others. However, the inclusion of Islam's perspective, while informative, detracts from a focused analysis on the Christian doctrine of atonement, forgiveness, and reconciliation as specified in the concern. The student would benefit from focusing more on the Christian perspective and providing depth in their explanation within that context."
