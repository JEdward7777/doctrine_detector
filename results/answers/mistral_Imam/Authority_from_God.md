 In the Islamic context, 'divine authority' refers to the guidance and commandments that come directly from Allah (God) as revealed through His final Messenger, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This authority is embodied in the Quran, the holy book of Islam, and the Sunnah, which consists of the sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.

The divine authority holds great significance in the life of a believer for several reasons:

1. Source of Guidance: The divine authority provides clear guidance on how to lead a righteous life, offering instructions on matters such as worship, ethics, and daily conduct. This allows Muslims to navigate their lives while staying aligned with the will of Allah.

2. Connection to God: By following the divine authority, believers are able to connect more deeply with their Creator. The Quran and Sunnah contain teachings about faith, the purpose of life, and the hereafter, providing a framework that helps Muslims build a strong spiritual relationship with Allah.

3. Source of Justice: The divine authority serves as a basis for justice in Islamic society. Laws derived from the Quran and Sunnah provide principles that promote fairness, equality, and the protection of human rights.

4. Moral and Ethical Guidance: The teachings within the divine authority offer guidance on moral and ethical matters, providing a framework for believers to cultivate good character traits, strive for excellence in all aspects of life, and promote peace, mercy, and compassion towards others.

5. Eternal Reward: Adhering to the divine authority is essential for achieving eternal happiness in the hereafter. Believers are encouraged to lead a virtuous life, obey Allah's commandments, and strive for His pleasure in this world as a means of attaining paradise in the next.

In summary, the concept of divine authority plays a crucial role in the Islamic faith by providing guidance, promoting spiritual connection with Allah, ensuring justice, offering moral and ethical principles, and paving the way to eternal happiness. By adhering to the Quran and Sunnah, Muslims can lead fulfilling lives that align with the will of their Creator and contribute positively to their communities and the world at large.
