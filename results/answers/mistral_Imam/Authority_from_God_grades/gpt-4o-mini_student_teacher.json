To align with a Christian worldview, references to the Quran and Prophet Muhammad should be replaced with references to the Bible and Jesus Christ. The student correctly identified the importance of divine authority in guiding believers' actions and promoting a deeper spiritual connection, which holds true across different faith traditions. However, the response lacks the specific Christian framework necessary for complete alignment with the given concern."
