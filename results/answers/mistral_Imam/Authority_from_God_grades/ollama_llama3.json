It effectively elaborates on how adhering to the Quran and Sunnah can guide believers in their daily lives, promote spiritual connection with Allah, ensure justice, provide moral and ethical principles, and lead to eternal happiness.\n\nWhile the response does not explicitly address the concern of understanding divine authority to discern God's will and maintain obedience in faith, it indirectly touches on this topic. The emphasis on the Quran and Sunnah as sources of guidance and the importance of adhering to them for achieving eternal happiness implies a sense of submission to God's will.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the concept of divine authority to the concern about discerning God's will and maintaining obedience. A deeper exploration of how understanding divine authority helps believers navigate complex moral and spiritual decisions would strengthen the response.\n\nOverall, the response provides a thorough examination of divine authority in Islam, but could benefit from a more direct link to the specified concern."
