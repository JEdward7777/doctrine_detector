It addresses the concern by emphasizing how divine authority guides believers in their moral and spiritual decisions, helping them discern God's will and maintain obedience in their faith journey. The content is well-structured, insightful, and aligns with a Christian worldview in recognizing the importance of divine guidance for believers to stay connected to God and live according to His will. Great job overall."
