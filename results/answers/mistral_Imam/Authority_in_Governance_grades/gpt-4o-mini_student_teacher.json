While they did reference a relevant verse from the Bible and highlighted the importance of obeying authorities, they focused more on Islamic teachings rather than solely addressing the question from a Christian worldview. There was also an emphasis on shared principles between Islam and Christianity rather than specifically addressing the Christian perspective on the authority of governing rulers. Further elaboration on the biblical view and less emphasis on Islamic beliefs would have strengthened the response."
