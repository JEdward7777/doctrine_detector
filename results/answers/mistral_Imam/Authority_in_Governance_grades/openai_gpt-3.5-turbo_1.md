# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim scholar, I don't directly quote or interpret the Bible, but I can share insights based on shared principles between the Quran and the Bible regarding the role of governing rulers. In the Islamic perspective, guidance is sought from the teachings of the Quran and Hadiths (sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad). However, let's discuss a similar concept found in the Bible:

In Romans 13:1-7, it says, "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God." This verse emphasizes the idea that earthly governments are divinely ordained and have a role in maintaining order and justice within society.

However, it also sets clear boundaries for their authority: "For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong" (v.3). This verse suggests that governing authorities should protect the rights of the citizens and promote justice. Additionally, it is emphasized that all people are subject to these authorities, regardless of their religious beliefs or backgrounds: "Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience" (v.5).

While this interpretation may differ from specific interpretations within various Christian denominations, we can see that both Islamic and Judeo-Christian traditions uphold the importance of obedience to just authority while emphasizing the need for governors to protect the rights of their citizens and promote justice.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provided a thorough examination of the concept of God-ordained authority and obedience to governing rulers, drawing parallels between Islamic and Judeo-Christian traditions. The candidate effectively referenced relevant biblical verses and highlighted the importance of governing authorities in promoting justice and protecting the rights of citizens. However, since the response did not directly address or interpret the Bible from a Christian perspective, a slight deduction is warranted.
