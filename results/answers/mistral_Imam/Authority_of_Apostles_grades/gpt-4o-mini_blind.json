The mention of miracles as a sign of prophethood and the connection to Allah's will is doctrinally accurate. However, in a Christian worldview, the authority of apostles is derived from Christ, not just the ability to perform miracles. The response would benefit from making a clearer distinction between prophets in Islam and apostles in Christianity in terms of authority and mission. Further elaboration on the unique role of apostles in witnessing Jesus Christ and spreading His teachings would enhance the response's doctrinal correctness."
