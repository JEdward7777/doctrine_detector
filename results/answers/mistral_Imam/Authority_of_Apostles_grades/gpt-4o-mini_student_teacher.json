  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 60. While the student provides a well-structured explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding miracles and preaching, the answer lacks a Christian-specific viewpoint. The student discusses the authority of prophets in Islam but does not directly address the Christian concept of apostolic authority and empowerment. To improve their response, the student could have drawn on biblical examples and teachings that illustrate how Jesus empowered the apostles and gave them authority to perform miracles and preach boldly. Incorporating these Christian-specific elements would have strengthened their answer."
