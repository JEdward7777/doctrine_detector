  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nWhile the response does touch on the concept of divine empowerment and authority, it primarily focuses on Islamic prophets and messengers, which may not directly align with the concern about exploring the apostles' ministry in a Christian context. The response also lacks direct connections to the original answer about Jesus empowering his apostles.\n\nHowever, the response does demonstrate an understanding of the importance of miracles as evidence for prophets and messengers, and it highlights the Quranic passages that support this concept. This shows a good grasp of Islamic scripture and its relevance to the topic of divine empowerment and authority.\n\nTo improve the grade, the response could have made more explicit connections between the Islamic examples and the Christian context, particularly highlighting how Jesus' apostles were empowered by God for their ministry. Additionally, the response could have explored other biblical passages that demonstrate the apostles' authority and divine empowerment."
