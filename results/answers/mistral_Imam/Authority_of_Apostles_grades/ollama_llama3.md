## [Answer](../Authority_of_Apostles.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, the prophets and messengers of Allah (God) were given various signs and miracles as proof of their truthfulness and divinely-ordained mission. These miracles served as evidence for the people they addressed, demonstrating that these prophets indeed came with a message from God Himself. The ability to perform miracles is not solely responsible for the authority of the apostles; rather, it is an integral aspect of their role as messengers.

The Quran states in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:136): "When Allah wills a matter, He only says to it 'Be,' and it is." This demonstrates that the ability to perform miracles comes from Allah's will for each prophet, as a means to confirm their message.

In terms of preaching boldly, the apostles were not merely sent with signs and miracles but were also tasked with delivering the divine revelation to humanity. Their authority came from Allah's command for them to convey His message, regardless of any opposition or difficulty they might face. The Quran states in Surah Al-Shu'ara (26:108): "And [mention] when We took from the prophets their covenant and from you [O Muhammad], and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary, and We made them leaders giving guidance to the people."

The combination of performing miracles and preaching boldly served to establish the credibility and authority of the apostles as messengers of Allah. Their mission was to deliver His message and guide humanity towards righteousness, and the miracles were proof that their messages were indeed divine in origin.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

While the response does touch on the concept of divine empowerment and authority, it primarily focuses on Islamic prophets and messengers, which may not directly align with the concern about exploring the apostles' ministry in a Christian context. The response also lacks direct connections to the original answer about Jesus empowering his apostles.

However, the response does demonstrate an understanding of the importance of miracles as evidence for prophets and messengers, and it highlights the Quranic passages that support this concept. This shows a good grasp of Islamic scripture and its relevance to the topic of divine empowerment and authority.

To improve the grade, the response could have made more explicit connections between the Islamic examples and the Christian context, particularly highlighting how Jesus' apostles were empowered by God for their ministry. Additionally, the response could have explored other biblical passages that demonstrate the apostles' authority and divine empowerment.
