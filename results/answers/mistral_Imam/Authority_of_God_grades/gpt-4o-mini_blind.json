However, it lacks depth in exploring the specific implications of God's authority over spiritual beings and could have benefited from referencing Islamic theology on angels and their relationship to Allah. Additionally, while attempting to draw similarities, it should have been clearer in highlighting the differences in the theological understanding of God between Christianity and Islam. More scriptural references and theological analysis would have significantly improved the response."
