  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful answer that drew parallels from Islamic scriptures to explain the significance of the term 'Yahweh of hosts.' While the student accurately portrayed the Islamic perspective on Allah's authority over angels and creation, the response could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern of how understanding God's authority can deepen faith and trust in His omnipotence. The student's answer lacked a clear connection to the Christian perspective on this topic from a faith and trust standpoint, which could have further enhanced the explanation."
