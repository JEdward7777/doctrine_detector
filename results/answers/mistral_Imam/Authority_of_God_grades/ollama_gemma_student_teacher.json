It provides a clear explanation of the term's meaning and parallels it with Islamic scriptures, specifically the Quran. The student also highlights the Islamic perspective on God's authority and sovereignty over all creation, including spiritual beings. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific implications of God's authority over spiritual beings in Islamic traditions or teachings."
