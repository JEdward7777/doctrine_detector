## [Answer](../Authority_of_God.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic perspective, the term "Yahweh of Hosts" is not directly mentioned in the Quran or Hadith as it comes from the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and is a part of Jewish and Christian tradition. However, we can draw parallels from our own scriptures to understand its significance.

The term "Yahweh of hosts" often translates to "Lord of Armies" or "Lord Sovereign of the Angels." It signifies God's supreme authority over all angels, spiritual beings, and creation in general. In Islam, we believe that Allah (God) is the Creator, Sustainer, and Ruler of all that exists, including angels.

In the Quran, we find similar references where Allah is described as "Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim" (The Most Merciful, The Most Compassionate), "Al-Malik Al-Qudus" (The King, The Holy One), and "Al-Aleem" (The All-Knowing). These attributes underscore His sovereignty, holiness, and knowledge over all things, including spiritual beings.

In summary, the term 'Yahweh of hosts' signifies God's absolute authority and supremacy over all creation, spiritual beings included, which aligns with the Islamic belief in Allah's (God's) omnipotence and oneness.
