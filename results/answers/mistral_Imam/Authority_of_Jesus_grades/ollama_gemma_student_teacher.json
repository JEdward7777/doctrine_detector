They accurately explain that the title primarily signifies Jesus' authority over the Israelites, but also suggest its broader implications as a fulfillment of prophecy and manifestation of his divine nature. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on how the title reinforces the idea of Jesus' authority over all creation, as per the teacher's reference answer."
