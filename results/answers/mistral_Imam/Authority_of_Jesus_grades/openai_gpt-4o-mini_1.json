  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response accurately addresses the concern by emphasizing Jesus' authority as King over all creation, thereby highlighting His divine kingship and sovereignty in believers' lives. However, the response also provides additional context from a scholarly perspective and compares Christian and Islamic interpretations, which may dilute the focus on acknowledging Jesus' sovereignty. Overall, a solid response with a Christian worldview perspective."
