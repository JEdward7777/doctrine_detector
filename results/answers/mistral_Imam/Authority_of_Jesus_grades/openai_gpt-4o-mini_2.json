While it correctly highlights the significance of Jesus' authority over his people in the Christian worldview, it falls short in emphasizing Jesus' authority over all creation and His divine kingship, which is essential for believers in acknowledging His sovereignty in their lives from a Christian perspective. The explanation could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting Jesus' divine kingship with believers' acknowledgment of His sovereignty."
