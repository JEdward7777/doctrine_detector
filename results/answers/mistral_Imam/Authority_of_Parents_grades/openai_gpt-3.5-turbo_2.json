The incorporation of specific verses from the Quran and the Bible, along with explanations of parental authority and guidance, reflects a solid grasp of the topic. The application of Ephesians 6:1-3 to highlight the Christian perspective on parental authority further enhances the discussion. However, the response could be strengthened by delving deeper into how Christian principles of obedience and authority can influence family dynamics and relationships in a more practical sense."
