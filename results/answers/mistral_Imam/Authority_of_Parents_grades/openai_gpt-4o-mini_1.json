The integration of Ephesians 6:1-3 from a Christian perspective further emphasizes the significance of parental authority within a Christian framework. The response effectively addresses the concern of navigating family dynamics within a Christian framework of obedience and authority by drawing on scriptural references and emphasizing the balance between obedience, respect, justice, and wisdom in both religions. However, additional biblical references could have been provided to strengthen the Christian perspective further."
