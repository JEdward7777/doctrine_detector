## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the context of your question, it seems there might be some confusion as the Psalms refer to a book in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, not specifically within Islamic texts. The Psalms are traditionally attributed to various authors who were kings, prophets, or other figures from ancient Israel. However, it's important to note that according to Islamic belief, the Tawrah (Torah), Zabur (Psalms), and Injil (Gospel) have been altered from their original forms as they were not preserved by the Jews or Christians.

In Islam, we believe in a set of revelations that were received by prophets throughout history, with the last being the Quran, which was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Quran is considered the final and most authentic guide for mankind.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response completely missed addressing the question about key figures involved in writing the Psalms. Instead, they focused on Islamic beliefs and did not provide any relevant information to enhance the understanding of the Psalms' messages and themes. The student should have focused on the Christian worldview and key figures mentioned in the Bible who are traditionally attributed to writing the Psalms.
