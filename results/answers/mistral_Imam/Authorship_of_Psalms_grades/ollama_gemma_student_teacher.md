## [Answer](../Authorship_of_Psalms.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the context of your question, it seems there might be some confusion as the Psalms refer to a book in the Jewish and Christian scriptures, not specifically within Islamic texts. The Psalms are traditionally attributed to various authors who were kings, prophets, or other figures from ancient Israel. However, it's important to note that according to Islamic belief, the Tawrah (Torah), Zabur (Psalms), and Injil (Gospel) have been altered from their original forms as they were not preserved by the Jews or Christians.

In Islam, we believe in a set of revelations that were received by prophets throughout history, with the last being the Quran, which was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Quran is considered the final and most authentic guide for mankind.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade:** 70

**Comment:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical context of the Psalms and acknowledges the traditional authorship of various figures from ancient Israel. However, the response lacks specific mention of the key figures identified in the reference answer, which undermines the overall completeness of the response from a Christian worldview perspective.
