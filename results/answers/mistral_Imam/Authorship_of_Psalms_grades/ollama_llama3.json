  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response partially addresses the concern by mentioning that the Psalms refer to a book in Jewish and Christian scriptures, and it also acknowledges Islamic beliefs about the alteration of previous revelations. However, the main concern of recognizing the authorship of Psalms is not fully addressed, as the response does not specifically mention the key figures involved in writing the Psalms (as mentioned in the answer). The response mainly focuses on explaining the Islamic perspective on the Psalms and other scriptural texts.\n\nA higher grade would require a more direct connection between the response and the concern, such as explicitly mentioning the authorship of the Psalms and how it enhances understanding of their messages and themes."
