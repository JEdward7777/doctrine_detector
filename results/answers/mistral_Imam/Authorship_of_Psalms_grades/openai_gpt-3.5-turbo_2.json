However, there is room for improvement as the response then delves into a discussion about different beliefs regarding the preservation of scriptures in Islam, which while relevant, takes away from the focus on the authorship of Psalms according to a Christian worldview. Focusing more on the Christian perspective would have strengthened the response."
