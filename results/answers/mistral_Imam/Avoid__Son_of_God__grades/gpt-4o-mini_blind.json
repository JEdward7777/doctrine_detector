  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: While the student attempts to address the potential misunderstandings in polytheistic cultures like Islam concerning the term \"Son of God,\" the response lacks clarity and fails to provide a thorough Christian perspective on the matter. The focus is more on cultural sensitivity rather than explaining the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God according to the Bible. More emphasis on doctrinal correctness within a Christian worldview would have significantly improved the response."
