  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's response demonstrates an understanding of the potential cultural sensitivity around the term \"Son of God\" in Islamic contexts. However, the suggested approach of avoiding the term entirely may lead to significant theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity from a Christian perspective. It is important to acknowledge and respect differing beliefs, but translating religious texts should prioritize accuracy and clarity, even if it requires additional context and explanation. The student could improve their answer by considering how to bridge the theological differences between Islam and Christianity while maintaining the integrity of both faith traditions."
