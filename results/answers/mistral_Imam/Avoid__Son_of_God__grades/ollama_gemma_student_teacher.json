  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theological implications of the term \"Son of God\" in both Christian and Islamic contexts. They provide a nuanced analysis of the potential for misunderstandings and suggest an approach to translation and dialogue that respects both faith traditions. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the importance of clearly explaining the Christian perspective on the concept of the Son of God and its significance in Christian theology."
