The suggestion to use terminology that adheres more closely to Islamic understanding of divine attributes is also well-intentioned.\n\nHowever, the main concern is about avoiding theological gaps and misunderstandings about Jesus' identity, which this response does not fully address. While it's true that explaining the concept carefully through context and explanation can be effective, it's essential to consider the potential implications of using a phrase like \"Son of God\" in an Islamic context.\n\nThe initial response's focus on avoiding the phrase altogether may not sufficiently address the concern about theological gaps and misunderstandings. A more comprehensive approach might involve exploring ways to discuss Jesus' identity and significance within an Islamic framework, rather than simply avoiding the term.\n\nOverall, while this response shows promise, it could benefit from further consideration of the concern about theological gaps and misunderstandings."
