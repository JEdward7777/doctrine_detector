  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response approaches the concern by acknowledging the potential for theological gaps and misunderstandings that can arise from avoiding the term \"Son of God\" in discussions about Jesus' identity. The recommendation to carefully teach the term's meaning through context and explanation aligns with a Christian worldview that values accurate theological understanding. However, the response also demonstrates respect for other faith traditions and emphasizes sensitivity in communication, which is commendable. Overall, it effectively addresses the concern from a Christian perspective while recognizing the need for cultural awareness and respect in interfaith dialogue."
