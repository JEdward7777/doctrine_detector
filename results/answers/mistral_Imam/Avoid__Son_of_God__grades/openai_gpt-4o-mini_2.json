However, the suggested approach of teaching the term through context and explanation aligns more closely with a Christian perspective, emphasizing the importance of understanding and communicating the core tenets of Christian beliefs. The response could have further emphasized the unique significance of the term \"Son of God\" in Christian theology and the implications of avoiding or altering it in interfaith dialogue."
