  "grade": 88.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 88\n\nComment: The answer provides a clear and informative overview of the different methods of baptism mentioned in the Bible and how they are interpreted in various Christian contexts. The student accurately presents the practices of immersion and affusion, along with their biblical foundations and denominational differences. The explanation of the interpretations within Roman Catholic, Baptist, and other Protestant traditions is well articulated. The grade could be higher if there was a deeper exploration of the theological significance of baptism within each denomination and a more thorough examination of relevant biblical passages."
