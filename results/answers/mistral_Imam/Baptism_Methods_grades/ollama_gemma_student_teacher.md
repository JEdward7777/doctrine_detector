## [Answer](../Baptism_Methods.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, there are two primary forms of baptism mentioned: immersion (full submersion) and affusion (pouring or sprinkling). These practices have been interpreted differently across various Christian denominations.

1. Immersion: This is the practice of being fully submerged in water for baptism. It is based on passages such as Matthew 3:16, where it is said that when Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, he went down into the water and then came up out of it. This form of baptism can be found among Baptists, some Pentecostal denominations, and certain branches of the Church of Christ.

2. Affusion: Also known as aspersion or sprinkling, this method involves pouring or splashing water onto an individual's head. It is based on passages such as Leviticus 14:7, which describes the cleansing of lepers by washing their garments and bodies with water, and sprinkling water on them seven times. This form of baptism is commonly practiced among Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and some Presbyterian denominations.

Regarding the interpretation of these practices in various Christian contexts, it's important to note that each denomination has its unique understanding of the significance and mode of baptism, often influenced by their historical and theological traditions. For example:

- Roman Catholics view baptism as a sacrament that removes original sin, restores the soul's relationship with God, and confers membership in the Church community. They practice infant baptism, usually by sprinkling or pouring water on the child's head during a celebration of mass.

- Baptists, on the other hand, emphasize believer's baptism, which means that only those who have consciously made a decision to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior should be baptized (usually by immersion). They believe that baptism symbolizes the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and signifies the believer's identification with Him in His death, burial, and resurrection.

- Many other Protestant denominations offer a range of practices concerning the mode and age of baptism, but they generally agree that it is a significant act of obedience to God and a public declaration of one's faith in Jesus Christ.
