  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise overview of the different methods of baptism mentioned in the Bible, including immersion and affusion. It also highlights the various interpretations and practices among Christian denominations, which aligns well with the concern to clarify the diverse methods of baptism. However, while the response does mention that each denomination has its unique understanding, it could go further in exploring the theological and historical contexts that shape these differences. Nevertheless, the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the diversity of baptism practices within Christianity."
