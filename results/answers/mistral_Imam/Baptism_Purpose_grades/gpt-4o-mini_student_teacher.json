They discussed the symbolism of baptism, its roots in the New Testament, and its importance in marking the beginning of a Christian's journey. However, the answer lacked a clear emphasis on the core Christian belief that baptism signifies cleansing from sin and union with Christ, as highlighted in the reference answer. This focus on the central Christian doctrine could have been stronger in the student's response."
