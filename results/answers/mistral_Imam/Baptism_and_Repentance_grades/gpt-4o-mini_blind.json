The answer should have focused more on the biblical teachings and significance of baptism as a symbol of repentance and entry into a new life in Christ. Additionally, the response does not adequately emphasize the doctrinal distinctions between the two concepts, particularly within a Christian worldview. Further scriptural references and theological analysis would have strengthened the explanation."
