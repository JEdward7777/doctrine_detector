## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, it is important to clarify that while we share many common stories and figures with Judaism, including the Pharisees, our beliefs may not always perfectly align due to differences in interpretation and theological development over time.

In general, the Pharisees, as a Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, believed in an afterlife where reward or punishment would be meted out based on one's deeds in this life. They emphasized the importance of upholding Torah law and practicing good deeds to ensure a favorable outcome in the hereafter.

Regarding spiritual beings, the Pharisees were known for their belief in angels, demons, and the resurrection of the dead. They believed that these spiritual entities interacted with humans and played significant roles in human affairs. It is also mentioned in Islamic tradition that the Pharisees were aware of Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) impending advent and expected a great prophet to come from among their own people, who they called the Messiah or the Son of Joseph, but their expectations differed significantly from what actually occurred.

However, it is crucial to remember that these interpretations are based on Islamic sources' accounts of Judaism during the time of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). A more comprehensive understanding would require delving into primary sources and scholarly works on Jewish beliefs and history, as well as considering the evolution of beliefs over centuries.
