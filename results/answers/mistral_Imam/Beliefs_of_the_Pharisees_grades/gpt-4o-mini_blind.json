  "grade": 45.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 45/100.\n\nThe student provides some accurate information about the Pharisees' beliefs in an afterlife, spiritual beings, and their anticipation of a Messiah. However, the answer is heavily flavored with an Islamic perspective rather than a Christian worldview, which should be the focus for this grading. The inclusion of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and Islamic interpretations detracts from the clarity and accuracy of the Christian perspective on the beliefs of the Pharisees.\n\nA more focused response on the Pharisees' beliefs according to Jewish and Christian sources, without the Islamic lens, would have been more appropriate for this question. Additionally, theological accuracy and doctrinal relevance were not adequately addressed."
