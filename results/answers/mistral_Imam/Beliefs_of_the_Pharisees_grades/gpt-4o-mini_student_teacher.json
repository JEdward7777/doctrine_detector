  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: \nThe student's response contains some accurate information about the Pharisees' beliefs in the afterlife and spiritual beings, which aligns with the reference answer provided by the teacher. However, the answer is heavily influenced by an Islamic perspective rather than focusing on Christian-specific beliefs. The student incorrectly references Prophet Muhammad and Islamic traditions in discussing Jewish beliefs during Jesus' time, which is not relevant to understanding the spiritual landscape at that historical period. To improve the grade, the student needs to focus on providing a more accurate and Christian-centered analysis of the Pharisees' beliefs."
