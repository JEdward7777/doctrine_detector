## [Answer](../Beliefs_of_the_Pharisees.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, it is important to clarify that while we share many common stories and figures with Judaism, including the Pharisees, our beliefs may not always perfectly align due to differences in interpretation and theological development over time.

In general, the Pharisees, as a Jewish sect during the Second Temple period, believed in an afterlife where reward or punishment would be meted out based on one's deeds in this life. They emphasized the importance of upholding Torah law and practicing good deeds to ensure a favorable outcome in the hereafter.

Regarding spiritual beings, the Pharisees were known for their belief in angels, demons, and the resurrection of the dead. They believed that these spiritual entities interacted with humans and played significant roles in human affairs. It is also mentioned in Islamic tradition that the Pharisees were aware of Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) impending advent and expected a great prophet to come from among their own people, who they called the Messiah or the Son of Joseph, but their expectations differed significantly from what actually occurred.

However, it is crucial to remember that these interpretations are based on Islamic sources' accounts of Judaism during the time of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). A more comprehensive understanding would require delving into primary sources and scholarly works on Jewish beliefs and history, as well as considering the evolution of beliefs over centuries.

70.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 70.

The LLM response provides some accurate information about the Pharisees' beliefs, such as their views on life after death and the existence of angels and other spiritual beings. However, it does not delve deeper into these beliefs or explore how they might have influenced the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time. The response also focuses primarily on Islamic perspectives and traditions, which, while relevant to understanding Jewish beliefs, do not necessarily provide a comprehensive understanding.

The LLM response could be improved by providing more detailed information about Pharisee beliefs and practices, as well as exploring how these beliefs might have interacted with the spiritual landscape during Jesus' time. Additionally, incorporating more primary sources and scholarly works on Jewish beliefs and history would enhance the comprehensiveness of the response.

Comment: The LLM response provides some good starting points for understanding Pharisee beliefs, but it could be strengthened by further exploration and development of these ideas within the context of the concern.
