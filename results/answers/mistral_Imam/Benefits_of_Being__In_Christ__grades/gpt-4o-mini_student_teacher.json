While the response provides some general benefits of sharing religious beliefs, it fails to address the question from a Christian perspective. The answer from an Islamic viewpoint also strays from the topic. The student needs to focus more on the core beliefs and teachings of Christianity when discussing the benefits of sharing 'in Christ'."
