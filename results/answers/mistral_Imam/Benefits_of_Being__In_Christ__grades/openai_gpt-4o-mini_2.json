The response should have focused more on how knowing Christ can impact daily living, decision-making, relationships, and moral conduct. Emphasizing the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice is a key aspect that should have been elaborated on further. The response did not effectively connect the practical implications of a relationship with Christ to the benefits of sharing 'in Christ.'"
