  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60. While the student did mention the reassurance, comfort, and protection that comes with God's instruction to \"fear not,\" they also included a comparison with the Islamic context which can be distracting and not entirely relevant to the Christian perspective. The answer strayed from the main focus of God's assurance and encouragement to believers. Additionally, the student should have emphasized the importance of trusting in God's power and presence more prominently in their response to align with the Christian worldview."
