However, the inclusion of \"peace be upon him\" after mentioning Jesus may not align with a Christian worldview, as it is more commonly associated with Islamic veneration of prophets. To improve the response, the student should avoid intermixing Christian and Islamic theological elements and focus solely on presenting the biblical verses within a Christian context."
