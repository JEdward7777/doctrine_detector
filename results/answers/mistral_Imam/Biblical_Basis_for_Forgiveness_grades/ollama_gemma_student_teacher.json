They provide relevant Bible verses that support this concept and explain how these verses reflect the teachings of Jesus. However, the answer could be improved by focusing more specifically on the concern of identifying scripture that supports the practice of forgiveness among believers. The conclusion could also be strengthened by explicitly connecting the verses mentioned to the practice of forgiveness among believers in Christian contexts."
