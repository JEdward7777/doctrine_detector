 In Islam, we highly value the teachings that promote peace, harmony, and compassion, which can be found in both the Quran and the Bible. The Bible also contains several verses that emphasize the importance of forgiveness among individuals. Here are a few examples:

1. Matthew 6:14-15 (New International Version): "If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."

2. Mark 11:25 (New International Version): "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."

3. Ephesians 4:31-32 (New International Version): "Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

4. Colossians 3:12-13 (New International Version): "Therefore, as Godâ€™s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."

These verses reflect the teachings of Jesus (peace be upon him), who was a prophet revered in Islam as well as Christianity, emphasizing the importance of forgiveness among individuals and teaching us to treat others with kindness and compassion.
