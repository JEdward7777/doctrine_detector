The verses cited align well with the concern provided, showcasing the importance of forgiveness as demonstrated in the Bible. The reference to the teachings of Jesus (peace be upon him) in both Islam and Christianity further reinforces the shared value of forgiveness in both faiths. Great connection made between the verses and the concept of forgiveness."
