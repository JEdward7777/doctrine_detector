## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the New Testament, the role and responsibilities of deacons (diakonoi in Greek) are described in Acts 6:1-7 and 1 Timothy 3:8-13. According to these passages, deacons were initially appointed in the early Christian community to deal with the issue of widows not being served adequately due to the rapid growth of the church (Acts 6:1).

Their primary responsibility was to ensure that the daily distribution of food and other resources was done fairly and efficiently, so that no one would be neglected or mistreated (Acts 6:2-4). In essence, they were to serve and care for the practical needs of the community members, particularly the vulnerable ones like widows.

In terms of character qualities, deacons were expected to be men of honesty, dignity, self-control, devotion to faith, and sound judgment (1 Timothy 3:8-10). They were also required to be husband of one wife, temperate, not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not addicted to wine or pugnacious, gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money.

Deacons are considered servants (diakonoi) of the church and their role involves serving others, particularly those in need, in a manner that is guided by Christian values and principles. They are not ordained to perform sacramental functions like priests or ministers but play a crucial part in the practical administration and outreach activities of the congregation.
