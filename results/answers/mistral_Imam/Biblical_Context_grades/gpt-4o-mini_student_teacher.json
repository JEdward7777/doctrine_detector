  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 90. The student provided a thorough explanation of the responsibilities of deacons as described in the New Testament, referring to relevant passages and character qualities expected of deacons. The student also emphasized the importance of serving and caring for the practical needs of the community members, particularly the vulnerable ones. However, the student could have tied back more explicitly to the concern of ensuring fair treatment and care within the church community, which is the focus of the question. A stronger connection to this specific concern would have enhanced the relevance of the response."
