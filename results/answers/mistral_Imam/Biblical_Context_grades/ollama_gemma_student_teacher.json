The answer accurately summarizes the primary responsibility of deacons as ensuring the fair distribution of food and other resources to the community, particularly widows. Additionally, the student provides relevant textual references from Acts and 1 Timothy to support their claims. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the broader context of deacons' service within the early Christian community. The student's response primarily focuses on resource distribution, but deacons also played other significant roles such as caring for orphans and other vulnerable individuals."
