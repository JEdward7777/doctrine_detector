  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of how Prophet Moses and King David exemplified humility in the biblical context, supported by relevant scriptural references. The inclusion of both Old Testament figures adds depth to the discussion. However, to improve the grade, the response could have focused more exclusively on Moses as the primary example of humility to provide a more in-depth analysis of his character and actions. Additionally, tying in specific New Testament passages or theological reflections on humility from the Christian perspective could have further enriched the answer."
