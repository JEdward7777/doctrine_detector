  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed response discussing Prophet Moses and Prophet David as examples of humility in the Bible. While the response is well-written and informative, it deviates from the specific biblical example requested in the question. The direct biblical example given by the teacher of David as a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God is not explicitly addressed in the student's response, leading to a lower grade. The connection between humility and the biblical examples could have been clearer and more focused on the specific characters exemplifying humility in the scriptures."
