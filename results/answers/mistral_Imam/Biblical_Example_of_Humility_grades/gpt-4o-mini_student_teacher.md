## [Answer](../Biblical_Example_of_Humility.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Biblical context, one of the most notable characters who embodied humility is Prophet Moses (known as Musa in Arabic). The story of his life can be found in the Torah, which forms part of the Old Testament in the Christian Bible.

Moses was born during a time when Pharaoh had ordered all Hebrew male babies to be killed due to their rapidly increasing population (Exodus 1-2). Moses' mother Jochebed hid him for three months and then placed him in a basket on the Nile, hoping that he would be found and raised by the Pharaoh's daughter. The princess named him Moses, which means "drawn out," because she had drawn him out of the water (Exodus 2:10).

Moses grew up in Pharaoh's court and became aware of his Hebrew heritage when he saw an Egyptian taskmaster mistreating a Hebrew slave. Out of anger, Moses killed the taskmaster and fled to Midian, where he lived as a shepherd for 40 years (Exodus 2:11-21).

God called Moses from the burning bush and commissioned him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt (Exodus 3-4). Despite his initial reluctance due to feeling unworthy, Moses agreed to God's call (Exodus 4:10-17). Throughout the rest of the Exodus story, Moses demonstrates humility by acknowledging his own weakness and trusting in God.

In addition, Prophet David, who is highly revered in Islam as well as Judaism and Christianity, also exemplified humility. Despite being chosen as king and defeating Goliath, he never allowed success to go to his head (1 Samuel 17-30). When confronted by the prophet Nathan about his sin of taking Bathsheba, David showed remorse and repented (2 Samuel 12).

These examples of Moses and David from the Biblical narrative demonstrate humility as a crucial trait for leaders and individuals alike. They show that even great men can acknowledge their weaknesses, trust in God, seek forgiveness when they err, and place others' needs above their own.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a detailed response discussing Prophet Moses and Prophet David as examples of humility in the Bible. While the response is well-written and informative, it deviates from the specific biblical example requested in the question. The direct biblical example given by the teacher of David as a humble and righteous man who trusted and obeyed God is not explicitly addressed in the student's response, leading to a lower grade. The connection between humility and the biblical examples could have been clearer and more focused on the specific characters exemplifying humility in the scriptures.
