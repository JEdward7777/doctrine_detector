  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides several excellent examples of humility from the Bible, including Moses and David. It effectively uses scripture references to support its claims, demonstrating a good understanding of the biblical narrative. The writer also does a great job of highlighting how these individuals embodied humility in their actions and reactions, which is important for leaders and individuals alike.\n\nWhile the response could be stronger in terms of explicitly connecting these examples back to the original concern about finding tangible examples of humility in scriptures, it still effectively demonstrates this concept through its storytelling approach. Overall, a strong grade, but with room for improvement in terms of directly addressing the concern."
