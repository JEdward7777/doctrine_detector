  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively provides tangible examples of humility from the scriptures, specifically focusing on Prophet Moses and King David. The Biblical narratives of Moses and David showcase humility through their actions, decisions, and attitudes towards God and others. The response effectively connects these examples to the concept of humility as a crucial trait for leaders and individuals. The only suggestion for improvement would be to delve further into the specific actions or statements that explicitly illustrate humility in Moses and David's lives for a more comprehensive analysis, but overall, the response effectively addresses the concern."
