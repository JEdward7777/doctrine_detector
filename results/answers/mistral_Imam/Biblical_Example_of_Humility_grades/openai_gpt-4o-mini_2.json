The explanation of how Moses demonstrated humility by acknowledging his weaknesses, trusting in God, and leading the Israelites despite feeling unworthy, as well as David's humility in repenting for his sins and not letting success go to his head, effectively illustrates the concept of humility based on the given Christian worldview. However, it would have been even stronger if more specific verses or details were included to further support the examples given."
