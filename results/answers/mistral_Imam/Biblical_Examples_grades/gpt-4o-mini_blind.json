However, the question specifically asked for biblical figures and their portrayals in the Bible, not the Quran or Hadith. The response lacks direct references to biblical figures and misses the mark in providing insights on individuals like Enoch, Noah, and Job who are mentioned as blameless in the Christian Bible. The inclusion of relevant biblical figures with lessons drawn directly from their lives would have made the answer more accurate and aligned with the given question."
