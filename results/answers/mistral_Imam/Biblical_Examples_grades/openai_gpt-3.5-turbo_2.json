  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided valuable insights into the significance of various prophets and figures in Islam, highlighting their virtues and teachings. However, the discussion focused primarily on the perspectives and teachings within Islam, without directly addressing the concern regarding how Christians can apply the concept of blamelessness in their own lives through studying these figures. While the response was informative and well-written, it did not sufficiently address the specific concern raised in the grading criteria."
