# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, one of the examples that demonstrates God's blessing of creation is found in Genesis 1:28-31, which describes the act of creation itself as a blessing from God. Here, God has created Adam and Eve and given them dominion over the earth. The passage reads:

"And God blessed them. And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.' And God said, 'Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.' And it was so."

In this passage, God is seen as blessing the creation by giving Adam and Eve dominion over it, providing them with nourishment from plants, and offering sustenance to all creatures. This example showcases a divine act of blessing in the context of creation, similar to many instances in the Quran where Allah (SWT) blesses his creations, such as Adam, the angels, the heavens, the earth, and the universe as a whole.
