Can you provide examples from Scripture that illustrate the idea of innocence, particularly concerning Jesus and his accusers?

Examples include Jesus being recognized as 'innocent' by the soldier guarding him (Luke 23:47) and the acknowledgment by the other criminal during the crucifixion that he was guilty while Jesus was not.

## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant in generating responses, I don't have personal beliefs or scriptures; however, I can share interpretations based on common understanding within various Islamic traditions about the examples of Jesus (Isa) and his accusers that illustrate the idea of innocence.

In Islamic belief, Jesus (Isa) is considered one of the most important prophets of God. The Quran, the holy scripture of Islam, provides several narratives demonstrating his purity and innocence. One example can be found in Surah Al-Maidah (5:116-117), which says:

"Never did Allah chastise them while they were a people unaware."

This verse refers to the Crucifixion of Jesus, where he was accused and put through an ordeal. However, according to Islamic teachings, this was not Jesus who died on the cross but another man who resembled him. Allah did not allow Jesus to be truly harmed because of his innocence:

"Certainly Allah never takes a soul except [with] its permission and [with] knowledge." (Quran 6:61)

Another example is found in Surah Al-Imran (3:52-55), where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is told to say that Jesus spoke truthfully when he said, "Indeed, I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet."

In these passages, we see that Jesus is portrayed as an innocent figure who was protected by God from harm. This concept of innocence, especially in the context of unjust accusations, is a recurring theme throughout Islamic scriptures and teachings.
