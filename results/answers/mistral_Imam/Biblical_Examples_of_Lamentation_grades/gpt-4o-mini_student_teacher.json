However, the student could improve their answer by focusing more on the aspects of honest communication with God and the importance of bringing sorrows before Him, as emphasized in the reference answer. Additionally, incorporating more specific references or quotes from the Bible to support their points would strengthen the answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
