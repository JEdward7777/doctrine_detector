The examples chosen effectively highlight the concept of mercy as rooted in forgiveness and compassion. Additionally, the response effectively conveys the importance of showing mercy to others based on these biblical narratives. However, the response could have further developed the connection between scriptural references and real-life applications to enhance understanding more deeply."
