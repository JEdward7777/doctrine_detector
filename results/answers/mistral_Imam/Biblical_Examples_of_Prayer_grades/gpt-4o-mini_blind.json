However, they missed the opportunity to emphasize the connection between faith, obedience, and the effectiveness of prayer in these instances. Additionally, they could have highlighted the sovereignty of God in answering prayers according to His will. Encouraging the integration of these key biblical principles would have enhanced the doctrinal correctness of the response."
