  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided well-detailed examples from the Bible that demonstrate acts of repentance, illustrating the practical application of repentance in believers' lives. They effectively highlighted key biblical figures like King David, the Ninevites, the Publican and the Pharisee, and Peter. However, the grade is slightly lower as the response could have been improved by including more concise examples, similar to the teacher's reference answer, and focusing on the essential aspect of repentance in each example. Overall, a solid effort in connecting biblical examples to the practical application of repentance."
