  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful response by drawing parallels between Islamic and Biblical stories to illustrate the concept of transgression. While the student's examples were relevant and well-explained, they did not directly address the question by citing specific Biblical references as requested. Encouraging the student to directly reference Biblical verses related to transgression would strengthen their answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
