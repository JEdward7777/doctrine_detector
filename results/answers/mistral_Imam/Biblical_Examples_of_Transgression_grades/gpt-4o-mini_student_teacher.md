 In Islam, we believe that the Quran is the final revelation and the primary source of guidance. However, understanding certain Islamic concepts can be enriched by comparing them with relevant biblical references, given the shared Abrahamic roots of our faiths.

One of the key concepts of transgression in both Islam and Judaism/Christianity is found in the story of Adam and Eve (Quran 20:120-124; Genesis 3:6-7, 9). In this narrative, God forbids Adam and Eve from eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. They disobey God by consuming its fruit, which is considered a transgression against divine law. This story serves as an illustration of human's natural tendency to stray from obedience towards God.

Another biblical reference that highlights the concept of transgression is the story of Noah (Quran 11:45-46; Genesis 6:5-7:24). God becomes displeased with humanity due to their widespread corruption and wickedness, including transgressions like immorality, violence, and injustice. In response, God sends a flood to purify the earth. This story serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of transgressing against divine guidance.

Lastly, the story of King David (Quran 38:20-40; 2 Samuel 11) provides an example of transgression leading to accountability and repentance. King David commits adultery with Bathsheba, then arranges for her husband Uriah's death to cover his transgressions. However, God punishes him severely through the consequences of his actions, ultimately bringing about repentance from David.

These stories are important in both Islamic and biblical contexts as they serve as reminders of the dangers of transgressing against divine guidance, the importance of obedience, and the possibility of repentance when one stumbles.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thoughtful response by drawing parallels between Islamic and Biblical stories to illustrate the concept of transgression. While the student's examples were relevant and well-explained, they did not directly address the question by citing specific Biblical references as requested. Encouraging the student to directly reference Biblical verses related to transgression would strengthen their answer from a Christian worldview perspective.
