  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively connects Islamic stories with relevant biblical references to highlight the concept of transgression against divine guidance. By emphasizing the importance of learning from biblical examples to avoid similar pitfalls in one's own life, the response demonstrates a thoughtful reflection on the shared Abrahamic roots of faiths and the need for obedience and repentance. The integration of additional biblical references could have further strengthened the response, earning a slightly higher grade."
