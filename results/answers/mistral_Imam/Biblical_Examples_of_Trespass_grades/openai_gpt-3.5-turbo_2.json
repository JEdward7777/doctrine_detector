The additional examples from 1 Samuel 25:28 and Romans 5:20-21 effectively emphasize the themes of mercy, grace, and God's forgiveness, aligning well with the concern of evaluating biblical examples to understand the implications of actions and God's forgiveness. Your approach in integrating these passages with the initial examples provided demonstrates a strong understanding of Christian principles and teachings. Well done!"
