The passage from Isaiah 44:6-20 is well-cited and provides a clear example of God's denouncement of idolatry. The student also correctly points out the uniqueness of God and His power over all things, contrasting this with the limited abilities of idols. The inclusion of the Islamic context adds an interesting perspective and demonstrates the universality of the message against idolatry."
