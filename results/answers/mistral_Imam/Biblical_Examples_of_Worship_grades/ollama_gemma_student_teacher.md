## [Answer](../Biblical_Examples_of_Worship.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, there is a clear contrast between true worship of God and the false worship of idols. One such example can be found in the Old Testament book of Isaiah (Isaiah 44:6-20). Here, God through Prophet Isaiah denounces idolatry and contrasts it with the worship He deserves.

In this passage, God says, "Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: 'I am the First and I am the Last; besides me there is no god. Who is like me? Let them proclaim and declare it, let them set forth and present it before me. Who has announced from of old what we have accomplished? Let them tell us what is yet to come." (Isaiah 44:6-8)

God asserts His uniqueness and omniscient nature, challenging the idols to prove their ability to do the same. The passage continues with a description of how these idols are made by humans from materials like wood or metal. God contrasts this with His power over all things: "Do not tremble, do not be afraid; did I not announce it long ago and say: My purpose will be fulfilled, and I will accomplish all my pleasure?" (Isaiah 46:10)

This passage emphasizes the importance of true worship that recognizes God's unique position as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, in contrast to the vain attempts at false worship through idolatry. This message resonates strongly within the Islamic context as well, where Shirk (associating partners with Allah) is strictly forbidden.
