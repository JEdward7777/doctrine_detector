  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: While the student provided some relevant information about Jesus from an Islamic perspective, the answer did not directly address the specific directive Jesus gave to his apostles regarding the good news. The response focused more on Islamic beliefs about Jesus rather than addressing the question from a Christian perspective. Additionally, there were some inaccuracies in equating Islamic beliefs with Christian teachings. The student could have improved the grade by focusing on the teachings of Jesus found in the New Testament and how they relate to spreading the Gospel according to Christian beliefs."
