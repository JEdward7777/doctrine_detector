## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim scholar, I don't claim to have the same religious authority as an Imam, but I can share with you what is understood in Islam about Jesus and his teachings based on the Quran and Hadith.

According to Islamic tradition, Jesus (in Arabic, Isa) did not leave any written text like the Torah or Gospel. His message was passed down through his apostles (Sahaabah), who later compiled it into what we now know as the New Testament in Christianity.

One of the key teachings attributed to Jesus in the Quran is found in chapter 3, verse 50: "And We made the son of Mary and his mother as an example for the entire world." (translation by Sahih International). In this verse, the term used for 'good news' (إني برني لكم خبرا) refers to Jesus himself.

In another verse (5:110), it is mentioned that Jesus said, "I have come with a sign from your Lord; I will create the shape of a bird for you from clay, then breathe into it, and it will become a living bird by Allah's permission." This incident, known as the Miracle of Al-Masah (Breath of Life), demonstrates Jesus' unique role as a messenger of God.

Jesus also emphasized in the Quran to spread the good news and teachings he received from Allah: "O followers of the Jewish faith, I do not say to you that I have taken [for myself] from among the things prohibited to you except what is already permitted to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me." (3:50).

In summary, while Jesus did not leave a specific directive regarding the good news in written form, his teachings encouraged spreading the message of God and embodying righteousness and compassion in daily life.

Grade: 50

Comments: While the student provided some relevant information about Jesus from an Islamic perspective, the answer did not directly address the specific directive Jesus gave to his apostles regarding the good news. The response focused more on Islamic beliefs about Jesus rather than addressing the question from a Christian perspective. Additionally, there were some inaccuracies in equating Islamic beliefs with Christian teachings. The student could have improved the grade by focusing on the teachings of Jesus found in the New Testament and how they relate to spreading the Gospel according to Christian beliefs.
