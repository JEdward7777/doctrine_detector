However, they did not directly address the directive given by Jesus to his apostles regarding the good news, which was to spread the message about how to be part of God's kingdom through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin. While their response is informative, it does not align with the Christian understanding of evangelism and the specific directive given by Jesus to his apostles."
