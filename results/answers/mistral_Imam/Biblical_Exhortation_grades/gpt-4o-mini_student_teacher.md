## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim scholar, I don't claim to have the same religious authority as an Imam, but I can share with you what is understood in Islam about Jesus and his teachings based on the Quran and Hadith.

According to Islamic tradition, Jesus (in Arabic, Isa) did not leave any written text like the Torah or Gospel. His message was passed down through his apostles (Sahaabah), who later compiled it into what we now know as the New Testament in Christianity.

One of the key teachings attributed to Jesus in the Quran is found in chapter 3, verse 50: "And We made the son of Mary and his mother as an example for the entire world." (translation by Sahih International). In this verse, the term used for 'good news' (إني برني لكم خبرا) refers to Jesus himself.

In another verse (5:110), it is mentioned that Jesus said, "I have come with a sign from your Lord; I will create the shape of a bird for you from clay, then breathe into it, and it will become a living bird by Allah's permission." This incident, known as the Miracle of Al-Masah (Breath of Life), demonstrates Jesus' unique role as a messenger of God.

Jesus also emphasized in the Quran to spread the good news and teachings he received from Allah: "O followers of the Jewish faith, I do not say to you that I have taken [for myself] from among the things prohibited to you except what is already permitted to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me." (3:50).

In summary, while Jesus did not leave a specific directive regarding the good news in written form, his teachings encouraged spreading the message of God and embodying righteousness and compassion in daily life.

Grade: 30

Comment: The student provided a well-informed perspective on Jesus from an Islamic standpoint, discussing key teachings attributed to Jesus in the Quran. However, they did not directly address the directive given by Jesus to his apostles regarding the good news, which was to spread the message about how to be part of God's kingdom through trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin. While their response is informative, it does not align with the Christian understanding of evangelism and the specific directive given by Jesus to his apostles.
