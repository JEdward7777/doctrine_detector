  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 75\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Quranic perspective on Jesus and his teachings. They accurately summarize the Islamic tradition that Jesus did not leave behind written instructions but encouraged the spread of his message. The inclusion of relevant verses from the Quran adds authority and authenticity to the response. \n\nHowever, the answer lacks direct engagement with the Christian specific concern of evangelism. While the student mentions Jesus emphasizing the spreading of the good news, the connection to evangelism as a specific Christian practice is not explicitly made. Additionally, the answer does not address the directive given to Jesus' apostles in the reference answer.\n\nOverall, this is a well-researched and insightful response, but it could be improved by explicitly addressing the Christian concern and aligning the response more closely with the reference answer."
