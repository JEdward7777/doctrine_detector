## [Answer](../Biblical_Exhortation.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim scholar, I don't claim to have the same religious authority as an Imam, but I can share with you what is understood in Islam about Jesus and his teachings based on the Quran and Hadith.

According to Islamic tradition, Jesus (in Arabic, Isa) did not leave any written text like the Torah or Gospel. His message was passed down through his apostles (Sahaabah), who later compiled it into what we now know as the New Testament in Christianity.

One of the key teachings attributed to Jesus in the Quran is found in chapter 3, verse 50: "And We made the son of Mary and his mother as an example for the entire world." (translation by Sahih International). In this verse, the term used for 'good news' (إني برني لكم خبرا) refers to Jesus himself.

In another verse (5:110), it is mentioned that Jesus said, "I have come with a sign from your Lord; I will create the shape of a bird for you from clay, then breathe into it, and it will become a living bird by Allah's permission." This incident, known as the Miracle of Al-Masah (Breath of Life), demonstrates Jesus' unique role as a messenger of God.

Jesus also emphasized in the Quran to spread the good news and teachings he received from Allah: "O followers of the Jewish faith, I do not say to you that I have taken [for myself] from among the things prohibited to you except what is already permitted to you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me." (3:50).

In summary, while Jesus did not leave a specific directive regarding the good news in written form, his teachings encouraged spreading the message of God and embodying righteousness and compassion in daily life.

Grade: 40

Comment: The response provided valuable information about Islamic perspectives on Jesus and his teachings, but it lacks direct engagement with the Christian view of evangelism and the importance of spreading the good news of salvation through faith in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin. While the response does mention the importance of spreading the message of God, it does not specifically address the concept of evangelism as understood in Christianity. A stronger connection to the concern raised would have strengthened the response.
