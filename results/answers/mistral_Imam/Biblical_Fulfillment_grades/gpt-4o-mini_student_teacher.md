## Question [Biblical Fulfillment](../../../questions/Biblical_Fulfillment.md)
How do the references to Jesus as 'King of the Jews' in the Bible reflect Old Testament prophecies?

## Correct Answer
The title reflects Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah who would be from David's line and establish an everlasting kingdom.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment is vital for Christian theology.

## [Answer](../Biblical_Fulfillment.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) is not the King of the Jews but rather a prophet of God sent to guide the Children of Israel. However, it is important to understand the context of these references in the Bible from a Christian point of view.

In the Old Testament, several prophecies are made about a future "Messiah" or savior who would be born from the lineage of King David (Isaiah 9:6-7, Jeremiah 23:5). This Messiah is foretold to reign as a king and bring peace and prosperity to the people of Israel.

In the New Testament, particularly in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is presented as the fulfillment of these prophecies (Matthew 1:1-25, Matthew 2:2). The "King of the Jews" title given to Jesus at his birth by the Magi and later used during his trial by the Romans reflects this expectation of a future Jewish king.

It is worth noting that Muslims believe in Jesus as one of God's messengers and we recognize many similarities between our beliefs and those of Christians regarding Jesus. However, we do not share the Christian belief that Jesus was divine or the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament. Instead, we believe that the Messiah has yet to come, and he will return before the Day of Judgment to establish peace and justice on earth.

In summary, from a Christian perspective, the references to Jesus as "King of the Jews" in the Bible reflect their belief that he is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning a future Jewish king and Messiah. However, Muslims understand these prophecies differently, believing that the Messiah has yet to come.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student's answer provides a thorough explanation from an Islamic perspective and transitions to a Christian viewpoint regarding the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. However, the response lacks a strong emphasis on the significance of recognizing biblical prophecy fulfillment in Christian theology. The student could have linked the concept of prophecy fulfillment to the core Christian belief in Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies more explicitly.
