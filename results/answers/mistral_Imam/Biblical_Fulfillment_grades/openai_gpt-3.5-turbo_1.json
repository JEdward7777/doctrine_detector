However, the response primarily focuses on explaining the Islamic perspective on Jesus rather than emphasizing the importance of recognizing biblical prophecy and its fulfillment for Christian theology. The explanation could have been more in-depth and explicit in connecting the significance of biblical prophecy fulfillment to Christian beliefs."
