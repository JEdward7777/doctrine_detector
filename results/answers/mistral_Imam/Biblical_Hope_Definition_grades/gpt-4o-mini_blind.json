The reference to Psalm 40:4 and the New Testament's emphasis on hope in Christ are appropriate. However, deduct points for the inclusion of information on Muslim beliefs, which is not directly relevant to the question on biblical hope. Focus on maintaining doctrinal correctness within a Christian worldview in future responses."
