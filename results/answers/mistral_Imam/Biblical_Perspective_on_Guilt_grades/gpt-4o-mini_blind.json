  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of how the Bible illustrates the consequences of guilt and sin through various examples. They have correctly referenced key biblical stories such as Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, as well as the Old and New Testament teachings on repentance and forgiveness. The response could be improved by incorporating more scriptural references to support the points made and by connecting the consequences of guilt and sin more directly to the theological concepts of separation from God and the need for redemption through Christ."
