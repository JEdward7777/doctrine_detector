However, it includes content referring to the Quran and Islam, which may not align with a Christian-specific worldview. The focus should have been solely on biblical references that highlight God's majesty within the Christian faith. Additionally, there is a need for greater emphasis on doctrinal correctness regarding the nature of God's majesty without interfaith comparisons."
