The answer also includes a comparison with Quranic verses, which although informative, may dilute the focus on connecting scripture specifically with a Christian understanding of God's majestic nature. It would have been better to concentrate solely on the Biblical references. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept but could benefit from more direct alignment with the Christian worldview."
