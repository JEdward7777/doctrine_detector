  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough and biblical exploration of God's majesty, citing specific verses from both the Old Testament (Isaiah, Job, Psalm) and the Quran (Surah Al-Imran). While it does not directly address the Bible references provided in the given answer, it effectively connects Scripture with an understanding of God's majestic nature by highlighting His power, holiness, uniqueness, and supremacy. The response also acknowledges the importance of understanding biblical verses within their historical and cultural context. However, to improve, the response could provide more direct connections between the specific Bible references provided and the concept of God's majesty."
