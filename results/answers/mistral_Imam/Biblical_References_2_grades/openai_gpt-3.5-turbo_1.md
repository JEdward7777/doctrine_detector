## [Answer](../Biblical_References_2.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helpful assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or affiliations, but I can certainly provide information based on various religious texts, including the Bible. In the context of your question about which Bible verses illustrate the concept of God's majesty, here are some examples from the Old Testament:

1. Isaiah 40:25-26 - "To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?" says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these stars? He who brings them out one by one and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing."

2. Job 9:8 - "Who, being pure, can look on him in his holy majesty? No man, uncorrupted and spotless, can see him; he conceals himself in a cloud and hides himself from our sight."

3. Psalm 96:4-5 - "For the Lord is great and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is the Lord who made the heavens."

These verses demonstrate God's majesty by emphasizing His power, holiness, uniqueness, and supremacy among all other deities. It is essential to remember that these verses should be understood in their historical and cultural context, as they are part of a religious tradition different from Islam.

In the Quran, similar concepts can be found in Surah Al-Imran (3:189), which states, "Allah is the Creator of everything. He is the One and Only; He controls all things. No one has the right to assert that He has a partner. His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth; all good things belong to Him."

In both the Bible and the Quran, God's majesty is portrayed as an essential aspect of His divine nature.
