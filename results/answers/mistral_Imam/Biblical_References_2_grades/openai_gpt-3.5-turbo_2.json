The inclusion of verses from the Old Testament, such as Isaiah, Job, and Psalms, effectively highlights God's power, holiness, and supremacy. Additionally, the mention of how these verses should be understood in their historical and cultural context demonstrates a thoughtful approach. The comparative analysis with a Quranic verse further enhances the understanding of God's majestic nature. Overall, this response effectively connects scripture with the understanding of God's majestic nature from a Christian worldview. Great job!"
