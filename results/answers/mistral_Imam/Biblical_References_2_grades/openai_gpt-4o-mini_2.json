The integration of additional verses and perspectives from the Quran adds depth to the understanding of God's majestic nature. The references are well-explained and connected to the overarching theme effectively. However, it could be strengthened by further emphasizing the unique Christian perspective in highlighting God's majesty compared to other belief systems."
