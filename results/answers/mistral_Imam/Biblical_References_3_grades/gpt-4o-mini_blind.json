The response presents a neutral stance based on Islamic and Christian interpretations without delving into the distinct Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of these prophecies. Additionally, a deeper analysis and explanation of the significance of these passages in relation to the Messiah would have strengthened the answer."
