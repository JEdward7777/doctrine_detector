## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, in the context of Islamic and Christian interpretations of the Old Testament, several passages are often referenced when discussing the concept of the "Son of Man" as the Messiah. Here are a few:

1. Daniel 7:13-14: In this passage, the "Son of Man" is presented as a divine figure who will receive dominion and everlasting kingship from God. This is one of the key passages where the term "Son of Man" is used, and it's interpreted differently in both Islamic and Christian traditions.

2. Daniel 9:25-26: This passage predicts that after 70 weeks (490 years), the Messiah will be cut off but will confirm a covenant with many for one week (seven years). In Christian tradition, this is often interpreted as referring to Jesus Christ.

3. Isaiah 53:2-12: This passage describes a suffering servant who bears the sins of many and makes intercession for them. While Muslims believe that this passage refers to Prophet Muhammad or other prophets, Christians interpret it as a prophecy about Jesus Christ.

4. Psalm 2:7-8: In this passage, God is said to have declared the Messiah as his beloved Son and given him dominion over the nations. This is another passage where the concept of the Messiah as a divine figure is emphasized.

**Grade: 80/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the connection between the Old Testament references and the concept of the "Son of Man" as the coming Messiah. They correctly identify and discuss relevant passages from Daniel and Isaiah, drawing on both Islamic and Christian interpretations. However, the response would benefit from a deeper analysis of the specific connections between these passages and the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Messiah.
