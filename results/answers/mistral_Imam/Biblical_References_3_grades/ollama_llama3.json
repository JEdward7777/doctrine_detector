  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does provide some relevant biblical passages, it primarily focuses on Islamic and Christian interpretations of the \"Son of Man\" without directly addressing how these Old Testament references inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\" The provided answer only mentions Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel, which is a good start but not sufficient to fully address the concern.\n\nThe response could be improved by more explicitly exploring how these Old Testament passages contribute to the development of Jesus' messianic identity in the New Testament. Additionally, incorporating more biblical references and analysis would strengthen the argument.\n\nHere's an example of what a stronger response might look like:\n\n\"The concept of the 'Son of Man' in Daniel 7:14, where Jesus is depicted coming with the clouds, sets the stage for his messianic role in the New Testament. Similarly, Ezekiel's prophetic identity as 'son of man' (Ezekiel 2:1) foreshadows Jesus' divine authority and prophetic ministry. These Old Testament references inform our understanding of Jesus as the Messiah, emphasizing his divinity, prophetic calling, and ultimate triumph over human opposition.\"\n\nComment: While the response shows some effort in exploring biblical passages related to the \"Son of Man,\" it falls short of fully addressing the concern by not explicitly connecting these Old Testament references to Jesus' messianic role in the New Testament."
