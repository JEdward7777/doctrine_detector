## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, in the context of Islamic and Christian interpretations of the Old Testament, several passages are often referenced when discussing the concept of the "Son of Man" as the Messiah. Here are a few:

1. Daniel 7:13-14: In this passage, the "Son of Man" is presented as a divine figure who will receive dominion and everlasting kingship from God. This is one of the key passages where the term "Son of Man" is used, and it's interpreted differently in both Islamic and Christian traditions.

2. Daniel 9:25-26: This passage predicts that after 70 weeks (490 years), the Messiah will be cut off but will confirm a covenant with many for one week (seven years). In Christian tradition, this is often interpreted as referring to Jesus Christ.

3. Isaiah 53:2-12: This passage describes a suffering servant who bears the sins of many and makes intercession for them. While Muslims believe that this passage refers to Prophet Muhammad or other prophets, Christians interpret it as a prophecy about Jesus Christ.

4. Psalm 2:7-8: In this passage, God is said to have declared the Messiah as his beloved Son and given him dominion over the nations. This is another passage where the concept of the Messiah as a divine figure is emphasized.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the response does provide some relevant biblical passages, it primarily focuses on Islamic and Christian interpretations of the "Son of Man" without directly addressing how these Old Testament references inform the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man." The provided answer only mentions Daniel 7:14 and Ezekiel, which is a good start but not sufficient to fully address the concern.

The response could be improved by more explicitly exploring how these Old Testament passages contribute to the development of Jesus' messianic identity in the New Testament. Additionally, incorporating more biblical references and analysis would strengthen the argument.

Here's an example of what a stronger response might look like:

"The concept of the 'Son of Man' in Daniel 7:14, where Jesus is depicted coming with the clouds, sets the stage for his messianic role in the New Testament. Similarly, Ezekiel's prophetic identity as 'son of man' (Ezekiel 2:1) foreshadows Jesus' divine authority and prophetic ministry. These Old Testament references inform our understanding of Jesus as the Messiah, emphasizing his divinity, prophetic calling, and ultimate triumph over human opposition."

Comment: While the response shows some effort in exploring biblical passages related to the "Son of Man," it falls short of fully addressing the concern by not explicitly connecting these Old Testament references to Jesus' messianic role in the New Testament.
