The inclusion of Daniel 7:14 and the connection between the title 'Son of Man' and prophetic identity is insightful. However, the response could have further elaborated on how these Old Testament references specifically influence the Christian interpretation of Jesus as the Messiah in the New Testament. Overall, a solid answer but with room for deeper analysis."
