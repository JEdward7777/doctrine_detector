However, the response could have delved deeper into how these Old Testament passages informed the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the \"Son of Man.\" It would have been beneficial to connect these Old Testament prophecies to how Christians interpret Jesus Christ as fulfilling these prophetic roles. Engaging more specifically with the Christian perspective would have strengthened the analysis."
