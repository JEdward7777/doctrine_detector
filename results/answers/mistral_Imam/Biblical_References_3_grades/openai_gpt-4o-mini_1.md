## [Answer](../Biblical_References_3.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, in the context of Islamic and Christian interpretations of the Old Testament, several passages are often referenced when discussing the concept of the "Son of Man" as the Messiah. Here are a few:

1. Daniel 7:13-14: In this passage, the "Son of Man" is presented as a divine figure who will receive dominion and everlasting kingship from God. This is one of the key passages where the term "Son of Man" is used, and it's interpreted differently in both Islamic and Christian traditions.

2. Daniel 9:25-26: This passage predicts that after 70 weeks (490 years), the Messiah will be cut off but will confirm a covenant with many for one week (seven years). In Christian tradition, this is often interpreted as referring to Jesus Christ.

3. Isaiah 53:2-12: This passage describes a suffering servant who bears the sins of many and makes intercession for them. While Muslims believe that this passage refers to Prophet Muhammad or other prophets, Christians interpret it as a prophecy about Jesus Christ.

4. Psalm 2:7-8: In this passage, God is said to have declared the Messiah as his beloved Son and given him dominion over the nations. This is another passage where the concept of the Messiah as a divine figure is emphasized.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provided a good overview of key references related to the "Son of Man" in the Old Testament, specifically referencing Daniel 7:13-14, Daniel 9:25-26, Isaiah 53:2-12, and Psalm 2:7-8. However, the response could have delved deeper into how these Old Testament passages informed the New Testament understanding of Jesus' messianic role as the "Son of Man." It would have been beneficial to connect these Old Testament prophecies to how Christians interpret Jesus Christ as fulfilling these prophetic roles. Engaging more specifically with the Christian perspective would have strengthened the analysis.
