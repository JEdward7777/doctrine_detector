## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that the Bible contains some authentic teachings and guidance from Allah (God) but has been subject to alterations over time. However, I can provide you with examples of biblical passages where 'Lord' is used in the context of God as it appears in the Christian Old Testament, which many Muslims consider partially divinely inspired.

1. Exodus 3:14 - "God said to Moses, 'I am who I am.' This is what you are to say to the Israelites: 'I am has sent me to you.'" Here, God identifies Himself as 'I AM', which can be understood in a way similar to 'Lord'.

2. Deuteronomy 32:6 - "Do you thus pay back the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is not He your father, who created you, who made you and established you?" This passage shows God as the Creator and Father of humanity, often symbolized by the term 'Lord'.

3. Psalm 110:1 - "The LORD says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'" This verse demonstrates the divine nature and authority of God, using the title 'Lord' in reference to both God and another powerful figure.

4. Isaiah 40:28 - "The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom." Here, 'Lord' emphasizes the eternal and all-knowing nature of God.

5. Jeremiah 10:10 - "But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King..." This passage highlights the eternal, living, and kingly attributes of God.
