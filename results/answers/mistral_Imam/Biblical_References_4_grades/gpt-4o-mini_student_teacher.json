  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 65/100. While the student did provide relevant biblical passages that illustrate the use of 'Lord' in the context of God and acknowledged the Christian Old Testament as containing divine inspiration, their perspective on the Bible being subject to alterations over time from an Islamic viewpoint may raise concerns from a Christian worldview. Additionally, the student's examples differ from the specific passages provided in the reference answer given by the teacher. A stronger alignment with Christian beliefs and a closer match to the reference answer would have improved the grade."
