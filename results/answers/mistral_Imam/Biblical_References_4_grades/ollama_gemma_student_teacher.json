  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of 'Lord' in the context of God within a Christian worldview. They provide relevant biblical passages that illustrate the diverse attributes of God as Lord. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern stated in the prompt regarding acknowledging God's authority and sovereignty. Additionally, including a brief explanation of the relevance of these passages within Christian theology would enhance the overall quality of the response."
