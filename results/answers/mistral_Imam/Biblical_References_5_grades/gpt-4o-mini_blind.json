However, the response could be improved by focusing more on the specific New Testament scripture that directly mentions the connection between unleavened bread and Christian teachings, such as 1 Corinthians 5:7-8 where Paul references \"Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\" Additionally, it is important to avoid interjecting personal beliefs or practices unrelated to the question asked."
