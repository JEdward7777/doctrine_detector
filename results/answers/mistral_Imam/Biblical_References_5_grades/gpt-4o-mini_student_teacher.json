  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided relevant information about the connection between unleavened bread and Christian teachings through the observance of the Passover and the Last Supper narrative. However, the student's reference to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John as the primary scriptures connecting unleavened bread to Christian teachings is not as precise as the teacher's reference to 1 Corinthians 5:6-8. While the student made some accurate points, the answer could have been stronger by focusing on the specific passage provided by the teacher."
