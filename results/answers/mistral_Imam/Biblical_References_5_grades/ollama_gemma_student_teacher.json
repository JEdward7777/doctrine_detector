  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* Provides a clear connection between the concept of unleavened bread and the observance of Passover in the New Testament.\n* Mentions specific scriptures associated with the Last Supper narrative, drawing attention to Jesus' participation in the Passover meal.\n* Offers an interpretation of the unleavened bread as a symbol of spiritual purity, aligning it with Christ's sinlessness.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* Doesn't directly address the concern of identifying relevant biblical texts related to Christian practices.\n* Doesn't explore the broader significance of unleavened bread in Christian teachings beyond its connection to the Passover meal.\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n\n* Could elaborate on how the use of unleavened bread connects to broader Christian beliefs about purity or spiritual transformation.\n* Could provide additional references to other New Testament passages that discuss the significance of unleavened bread in early Christian communities.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the connection between unleavened bread and Christian teachings, but could be strengthened by addressing the specific concern of identifying relevant biblical texts and expanding the analysis."
