## [Answer](../Biblical_References_5.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices. However, in a Muslim context, it is important to note that Muslims respect the religious texts of other faiths as they are considered to be part of the divine revelations.

In the New Testament of the Bible, the concept of unleavened bread (also known as matzo or azyme) is connected to Christian teachings through the observance of the Passover, which commemorates the Jews' exodus from Egypt. One of the most significant Christian scriptures associated with this is Matthew 26:17-29, Mark 14:12-26, Luke 22:7-23, and John 13:1-38 (The Last Supper narrative).

In these accounts, Jesus is said to have celebrated the Passover meal with his disciples, where they shared unleavened bread as a symbol of His impending sacrifice. The unleavened bread serves as a reminder of the haste in which the Israelites prepared and left Egypt (Exodus 12:34-39), and it also signifies spiritual purity for Christians, representing Christ's sinless nature and the new life He offers through faith in Him.
