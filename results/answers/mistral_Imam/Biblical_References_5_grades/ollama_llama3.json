  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 70.\n\nThe response does attempt to identify relevant biblical texts that provide insight into Christian practices, specifically discussing Matthew 26:17-29, Mark 14:12-26, Luke 22:7-23, and John 13:1-38 (The Last Supper narrative) in relation to the concept of unleavened bread. However, it does not directly address the concern or answer the specific question about Christian practices.\n\nWhile the response does provide some biblical context for the topic, it could be improved by more explicitly connecting the biblical texts to Christian practices and traditions. The mention of Jesus' sinless nature and the new life He offers through faith is a relevant point, but it feels somewhat tangential to the main concern.\n\nA higher grade would require the response to more directly address the question about Christian practices and provide more explicit connections between the biblical texts and Christian practices."
