The addition of 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 further enhances the discussion on the Christian perspective of unleavened bread. The context of the Passover and its connection to Jesus' sacrifice is well articulated, aligning with Christian beliefs on spiritual purity and redemption. Great job integrating scriptural references and Christian teachings."
