It effectively incorporates relevant biblical texts, such as Matthew 26:17-29, Mark 14:12-26, Luke 22:7-23, John 13:1-38, and Exodus 12:34-39, to support the significance of unleavened bread in Christian practices. However, it is recommended to also mention 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, which explicitly discusses unleavened bread in the context of removing sin from the church and relates it to Christian life and purity, for a more comprehensive understanding from a Christian perspective."
