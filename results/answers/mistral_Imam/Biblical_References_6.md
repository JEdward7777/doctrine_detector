## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that the Quran is the final and most authentic revelation from Allah (God) and it serves as our primary source of guidance. However, the Quran also confirms many of the essential teachings found in the Torah and the Gospel (Bible). Here are a few verses from the Bible that highlight the concept of resurrection, which is a shared belief among Muslims, Jews, and Christians:

1. Daniel 12:2 - "Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." This verse underscores the idea that there will be a day when the dead will be resurrected, with some being rewarded for their good deeds, while others will face punishment.

2. John 5:28-29 - "Do not marvel at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forthâ€”those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation." This passage emphasizes the universality of the resurrection, which includes both the righteous and the wicked.

3. Acts 24:15 - "And I have hope toward God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust." This verse is a testament to the belief in the resurrection held by Paul, one of the most prominent figures in early Christianity.

4. 1 Corinthians 15:20-22 - "But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a Man. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." This passage highlights the importance of Jesus's (peace be upon him) resurrection and its significance for the ultimate resurrection of humanity.

In Islam, the Quran confirms this concept of resurrection and provides further details about it:

1. Surah Al-Qiyamah 75:1-3 - "By (the token of) Time (through the ages), Verily man is in loss, Except such as believe and do righteous deeds, and recommend one another to the truth, and recommend one another to patience."

2. Surah Al-Insan 76:1-2 - "What! When we have reduced to dust a thing, can it (possibly) be resurrected [to life]?" And We (God) produce therein a new creation."

These verses emphasize the idea that God has the power to raise the dead and bring about a new creation, which is a concept shared with many believers in the Bible.
