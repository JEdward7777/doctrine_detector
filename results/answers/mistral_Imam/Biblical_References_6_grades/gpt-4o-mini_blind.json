However, the integration of Islamic beliefs and Quranic verses at length within a question specifically asking for Bible verses on resurrection deviated from the question's focus. It is important to stay within the scope of the question asked in order to provide a focused and cohesive response. Additionally, the mixing of Islamic and Christian beliefs without clarifying the differences may lead to confusion or misinterpretation of doctrinal distinctions. To improve, the response should focus on providing a more detailed explanation and analysis of the Bible verses related to resurrection, without including unrelated religious beliefs."
