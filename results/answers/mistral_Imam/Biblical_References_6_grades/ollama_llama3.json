  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the concept of resurrection in Islam and Christianity, with references to relevant Bible verses. It also highlights the shared belief between Muslims, Jews, and Christians regarding the idea of resurrection. While the focus is not exclusively on scriptural authority, it does provide some relevant biblical passages to support the concept of resurrection. However, a higher grade could be achieved if more emphasis was placed on the importance of scripture in grounding beliefs and teachings, as specified by the concern.\n\nThe response is strong in its presentation of Islamic perspectives on resurrection and provides additional context from the Quran. The inclusion of biblical verses from Daniel, John, Acts, and 1 Corinthians adds depth to the discussion. However, it could be improved by explicitly emphasizing the significance of scripture in establishing Christian doctrine, as specified by the concern.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could have:\n\n* Placed greater emphasis on the role of scripture in shaping Christian beliefs about resurrection\n* Provided more biblical references to support the concept of resurrection\n* Explored the implications of resurrection for Christian living and faith"
