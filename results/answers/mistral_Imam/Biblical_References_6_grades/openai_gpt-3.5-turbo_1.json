The inclusion of specific verses, such as Daniel 12:2, John 5:28-29, Acts 24:15, 1 Corinthians 15:20-22, alongside Islamic verses, demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic. However, the response could have further strengthened its argument by delving deeper into the theological implications of these scriptures within a Christian worldview and providing more direct analysis of how these verses align or differ with Christian beliefs. Nonetheless, the response effectively integrates scripture to support the discussion on resurrection."
