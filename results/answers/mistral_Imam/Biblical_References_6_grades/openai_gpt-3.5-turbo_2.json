  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a strong and comprehensive explanation of the concept of resurrection in Christian scripture, supported by various relevant Bible verses. The inclusion of verses from Daniel, Acts, and 1 Corinthians enriches the discussion on resurrection in Christianity. However, while the response does mention the importance of focusing on scripture for grounding beliefs, it lacks a direct mention of the need to prioritize authoritative Christian texts over other religious texts, which is an essential aspect of maintaining a Christian worldview."
