  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and respectful explanation of the significance of the Sabbath in the Christian faith, citing relevant passages from the Old Testament. The responses included appropriate references and explanations, aligning well with the concern provided. However, the student missed referencing some New Testament passages that further highlight the Sabbath's importance in Christian belief. Overall, a strong effort but could have been improved with additional incorporation of New Testament verses."
