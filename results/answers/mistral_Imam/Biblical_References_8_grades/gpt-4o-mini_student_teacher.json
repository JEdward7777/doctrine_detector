However, the answer heavily focused on comparing Islamic beliefs with Christian beliefs regarding Jesus and redemption, which was not directly relevant to exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. Additionally, the answer lacked key verses such as 1 Timothy 2:6, Isaiah 43:3, and Matthew 20:28 that are central to the theme of deliverance and redemption in Christianity."
