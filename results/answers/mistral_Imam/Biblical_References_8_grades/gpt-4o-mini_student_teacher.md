## [Answer](../Biblical_References_8.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, we believe that the Bible has been altered and does not contain the original messages as revealed to the prophets, including Jesus (peace be upon him). However, I can provide you with verses from the Christian Old Testament (Tawrah and Injil) which reference the concept of ransom, and discuss how they contribute to the understanding of redemption in a Christian context.

1. Exodus 30:12-16 - This passage introduces the concept of the "ransom for one's life," referring to the redemption price for a soul. The verse explains that this ransom is a sweet-smelling spice (incense) and a grain offering given to the Lord.

2. Leviticus 17:11 - This passage states, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for your souls on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life." Here, the concept of ransom is related to the shedding of blood as an act of atonement.

3. Mark 10:45 - Jesus (peace be upon him) stated, "For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." In Christian belief, Jesus's sacrifice on the cross served as the ultimate ransom paid for humanity's sins.

These verses demonstrate the concept of ransom as payment made to set someone free or make atonement for their sins. The understanding of redemption in Christianity is deeply rooted in this idea, with Jesus being considered the divine ransom who paid the price for humanity's salvation through his death and resurrection. In Islam, we do not hold the same belief regarding Jesus as a sacrificial lamb but view him as a prophet and messenger of God who was not crucified or killed (Sahih Muslim 194). Instead, Muslims believe in atonement achieved through repentance and good deeds.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided relevant verses from the Old Testament and the New Testament that reference the concept of ransom and tied them to the understanding of redemption in a Christian context. However, the answer heavily focused on comparing Islamic beliefs with Christian beliefs regarding Jesus and redemption, which was not directly relevant to exploring the biblical foundation for the theology of redemption. Additionally, the answer lacked key verses such as 1 Timothy 2:6, Isaiah 43:3, and Matthew 20:28 that are central to the theme of deliverance and redemption in Christianity.
