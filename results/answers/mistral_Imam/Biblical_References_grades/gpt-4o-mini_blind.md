 In the Bible, there are numerous verses that highlight the concept of covenant faithfulness, especially in the Old Testament where God makes several covenants with His chosen people, the Israelites. Here are a few examples:

1. Genesis 9:9 - "And I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the land that I swear to give to your offspring, to every living creature on earth." This is God's covenant with Noah after the Great Flood.

2. Exodus 6:7 - "I will take you as my people, and I will be your God. You shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians." This is God's promise to Moses regarding the covenant with the Israelites.

3. Leviticus 26:45 - "But I will remember for their sake the covenant I broke with their ancestors in the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt." Here, God reminds the Israelites of the covenant despite their disobedience.

4. Jeremiah 31:31-34 - "Behold, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah... For I will forgive their wickedness and remember their sins no more." This passage speaks of a new covenant that God will establish with His people.

5. Luke 22:20 - "And with the cup in hand, he [Jesus] said, 'This cup is the new covenant sealed with my blood, which is poured out for you.'" This verse from the New Testament indicates Jesus' institution of a new covenant with His followers.

These verses illustrate the concept of covenant faithfulness, emphasizing God's commitment to His people and their responsibility to remain faithful in return.
