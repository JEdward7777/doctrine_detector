  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nWhile the student provided a good selection of verses that highlight the concept of covenant faithfulness, their answer lacked references to Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18 as specified in the teacher's reference answer. In a Christian worldview, scriptural examples are crucial for understanding covenant faithfulness, therefore the absence of these specific verses could be considered a significant oversight. The student showed a good understanding of the concept overall and provided relevant verses, but the lack of reference to the verses pointed out in the teacher's answer affects the comprehensiveness of their response."
