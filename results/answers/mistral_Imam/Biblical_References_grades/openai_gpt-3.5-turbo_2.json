The examples chosen effectively support the concept of covenant faithfulness and tie back to the understanding of this theme in the Bible. However, it could be strengthened by elaborating on how the verses from Ezra 3:11 and Numbers 14:18 also contribute to the broader theme of covenant faithfulness in the context provided."
