However, the focus of the question was on exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion specifically within Christianity, and the response does not directly address this aspect. While the comparison between Islam and Christianity is valuable, the lack of direct engagement with the provided answer and concern limits the depth of the analysis from a Christian-specific worldview."
