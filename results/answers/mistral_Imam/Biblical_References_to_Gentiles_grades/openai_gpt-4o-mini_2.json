  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a thoughtful interpretation from an Islamic perspective, but it did not directly address the concern of exploring scriptural teachings on grace and inclusion as specified in the grading criteria. While the comparison between Christianity and Islam was interesting, the lack of direct engagement with the specific concern mentioned impacted the overall grade. The response would have been stronger with a more focused discussion on how the passages highlighted relate to grace and inclusion within a Christian context."
