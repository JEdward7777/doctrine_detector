However, the response missed the opportunity to engage with the Muslim-specific perspective on heaven and how it differs from the Christian understanding, thereby limiting the depth of the analysis from a Christian worldview. Encouraging further exploration and comparison between different religious beliefs could have enriched the response even further."
