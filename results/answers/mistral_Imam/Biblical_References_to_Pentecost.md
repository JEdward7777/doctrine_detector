## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that the Bible has been subjected to alterations over time and may not be fully preserved as it was originally revealed. However, according to Jewish tradition, which is closely followed by our Christian brethren, the books of the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) contain references to the Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot or Pentecost in Christianity.

The Festival of Weeks is mentioned in Exodus 34:22, Leviticus 23:15-21, Numbers 28:26 and Deuteronomy 16:9-12. It is a festival that commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai and is celebrated seven weeks (49 days) after the Festival of Passover. In Christianity, Pentecost is also significant as it marks the descending of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples of Jesus Christ.
