However, the answer veers off-topic by including beliefs from Islam regarding the Bible's preservation, which is not directly relevant to the question. The focus should have been on the biblical references without bringing in other religious perspectives. Additionally, the response could have been enhanced by emphasizing the Christian significance of Pentecost beyond just mentioning the descending of the Holy Spirit."
