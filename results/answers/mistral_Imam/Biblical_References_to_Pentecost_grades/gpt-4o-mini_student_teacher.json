  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the Festival of Weeks/Shavuot/Pentecost and its significance, citing relevant biblical passages. However, the student incorrectly attributed the references to the Festival of Weeks only to the Torah (first five books of the Old Testament), while the correct answer also includes the book of 2 Chronicles and the book of Acts. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the Christian significance of Pentecost beyond just mentioning the descending of the Holy Spirit."
