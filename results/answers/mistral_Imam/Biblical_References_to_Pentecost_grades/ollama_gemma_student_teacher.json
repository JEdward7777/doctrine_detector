  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the Festival of Weeks and its significance in both Jewish and Christian traditions. However, the answer lacks specific references to the books of the Bible mentioned in the reference answer. Including these references would have strengthened the student's response and earned them a higher grade."
