  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nThe main issue with this response is that it only provides a list of books and chapters where the Festival of Weeks is mentioned, without explaining their significance or relation to Pentecost. The concern was about understanding the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost, which this response barely addresses. While it mentions Acts, which has a passage related to Pentecost, it does not provide any meaningful context or connection between the Festival of Weeks and Pentecost.\n\nTo improve, I would expect the response to go beyond just listing references and provide some explanation about why these passages are significant for understanding Pentecost, such as discussing the historical events described in Acts 2 or exploring how the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai relates to the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost."
