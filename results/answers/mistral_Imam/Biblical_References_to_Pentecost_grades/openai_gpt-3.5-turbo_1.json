It would have been beneficial to explain how the event of Pentecost in Acts 2 fulfills and extends the Old Testament Festival of Weeks, highlighting the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering the disciples and launching the spread of the Christian faith. Additional scriptural references and theological insights would have enhanced the response."
