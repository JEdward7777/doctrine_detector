# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that the Bible has been subjected to alterations over time and may not be fully preserved as it was originally revealed. However, according to Jewish tradition, which is closely followed by our Christian brethren, the books of the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) contain references to the Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot or Pentecost in Christianity.

The Festival of Weeks is mentioned in Exodus 34:22, Leviticus 23:15-21, Numbers 28:26 and Deuteronomy 16:9-12. It is a festival that commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai and is celebrated seven weeks (49 days) after the Festival of Passover. In Christianity, Pentecost is also significant as it marks the descending of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples of Jesus Christ.

Grade: 50

Comment: The response correctly references the Festival of Weeks in Acts which is relevant to the Christian observance of Pentecost, but it does not provide an accurate scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost in Christianity. It would have been beneficial to explain how the event of Pentecost in Acts 2 fulfills and extends the Old Testament Festival of Weeks, highlighting the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering the disciples and launching the spread of the Christian faith. Additional scriptural references and theological insights would have enhanced the response.
