  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) as it relates to both Judaism and Christianity. However, the original answer indicating the specific verses in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy provides more specific and accurate references compared to the response being graded. It would have been better if the student had directly addressed the concern raised about understanding the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost instead of providing general information on the festival."
