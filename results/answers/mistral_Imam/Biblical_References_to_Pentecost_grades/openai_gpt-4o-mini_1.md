## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_Pentecost.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that the Bible has been subjected to alterations over time and may not be fully preserved as it was originally revealed. However, according to Jewish tradition, which is closely followed by our Christian brethren, the books of the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) contain references to the Festival of Weeks, also known as Shavuot or Pentecost in Christianity.

The Festival of Weeks is mentioned in Exodus 34:22, Leviticus 23:15-21, Numbers 28:26 and Deuteronomy 16:9-12. It is a festival that commemorates the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai and is celebrated seven weeks (49 days) after the Festival of Passover. In Christianity, Pentecost is also significant as it marks the descending of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples of Jesus Christ.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a good overview of the Festival of Weeks (Pentecost) as it relates to both Judaism and Christianity. However, the original answer indicating the specific verses in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy provides more specific and accurate references compared to the response being graded. It would have been better if the student had directly addressed the concern raised about understanding the scriptural basis for the observance and significance of Pentecost instead of providing general information on the festival.
