  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and respectful response, acknowledging the importance of Christian scripture in discussing the nature of Christ as Savior. They accurately explained the significance of the passages from 1 Timothy and 2 Peter in highlighting Christ's role in salvation. However, there was a slight deviation from the reference answer in fully emphasizing the centrality of Christ as the Savior who delivers believers from sin and provides eternal life. Nonetheless, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the Christian perspective on Jesus as Savior."
