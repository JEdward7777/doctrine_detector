  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a solid understanding of the biblical passages and their relevance to the Christian understanding of Christ as Savior. They clearly articulate the central themes of redemption and reconciliation through Christ's sacrifice and resurrection. However, the response would benefit from further elaboration on the broader context of salvation in Christianity, including the role of faith and grace in the process."
