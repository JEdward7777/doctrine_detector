  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The answer provided a solid explanation of the verses that reference Jesus as the cornerstone and their significance in conveying His role in Christianity. The explanations were clear and accurate, focusing on the doctrinal implications of Jesus being the cornerstone of the church. The inclusion of the metaphorical significance of the cornerstone in construction was also insightful. However, the answer could have further emphasized the divinity of Jesus as the cornerstone and His unique role in salvation, as understood within Christian doctrine."
