 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices, but I can share information based on religious texts. In Christianity, the concept of Jesus as the cornerstone is found in several books of the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Epistles (letters) written by St. Paul.

1. Ephesians 2:20 - "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,"

This verse suggests that Jesus is not just a stone in the foundation but the cornerstone itself. The cornerstone is traditionally the first stone set in the construction of a foundation, and it determines the alignment of the entire structure. This metaphor implies that Jesus is crucial for the structure (the church) to be aligned correctly.

2. 1 Peter 2:6-7 - "For it stands written: 'Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and he who believes in him will not be put to shame.' So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone,'"

This passage from 1 Peter refers to Psalm 118:22, a psalm traditionally sung on Jewish feast days. It suggests that just as the rejected stone became the cornerstone, Jesus, who was rejected by some, has become the most important part of the foundation for believers.

These verses convey Jesus' role as the foundational element upon which the church is built and the one who determines its alignment and stability. However, interpretations may vary among different denominations and individual readers within Christianity. It's essential to remember that understanding religious texts often involves cultural, historical, and contextual knowledge.
