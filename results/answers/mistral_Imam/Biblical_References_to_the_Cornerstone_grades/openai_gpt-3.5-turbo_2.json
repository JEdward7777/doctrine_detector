  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the specified concern with relevant Bible verses that highlight Jesus as the cornerstone in Christianity. The explanation is clear, well-supported with biblical references, and emphasizes the importance of exploring scripture for a deeper understanding of faith. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate more personal reflection or application for believers seeking to deepen their understanding of Jesus as the cornerstone in their faith."
