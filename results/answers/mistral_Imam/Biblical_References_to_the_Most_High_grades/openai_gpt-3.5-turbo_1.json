However, it does not directly address the concern regarding Christians needing guidance to fully appreciate the significance of God's sovereignty as portrayed in the Bible. To improve, the response could have included a brief reflection on the importance of exploring Scripture and seeking guidance to deepen one's understanding of God's sovereignty, specifically in the context of the verses mentioned."
