However, it focuses primarily on selected verses from the Old Testament and could benefit from incorporating more verses from the New Testament that also illustrate God's sovereignty and authority. Additionally, connecting these verses to the overall theme of God's sovereignty and the significance for Christians in their faith journey would enhance the response further."
