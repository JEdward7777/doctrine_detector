  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "This response provides a thorough explanation regarding the concept of the \"house of Yahweh\" from both Islamic and Old Testament perspectives. The student correctly addresses the absence of the specific term in the Quran and accurately identifies the reference to the temple in Jerusalem as \"the house of Yahweh.\" The response also illustrates respect for places of worship in Islamic tradition. However, the Christian-specific focus of the question was not fully maintained. There could have been more emphasis on the uniqueness of the temple as the dwelling place of Yahweh in Christian theology. Therefore, I would grade this answer at 75. Additional points could have been earned by deepening the explanation from a Christian worldview. Great effort overall, but room for improvement in addressing the Christian perspective."
