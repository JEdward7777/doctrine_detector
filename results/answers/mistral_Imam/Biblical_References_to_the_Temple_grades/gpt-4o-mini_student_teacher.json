  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided accurate information regarding Islamic beliefs and references to the House of God in the Quran. However, the student did not address the Christian-specific viewpoint or provide the specific scriptures from the Old Testament that directly reference the temple as the 'house of Yahweh'. Focus on addressing the concern with a Christian worldview next time for a higher grade."
