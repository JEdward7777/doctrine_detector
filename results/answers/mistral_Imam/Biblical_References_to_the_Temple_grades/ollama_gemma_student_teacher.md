## [Answer](../Biblical_References_to_the_Temple.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Holy Quran, there is no explicit reference to the temple as "the house of Yahweh." However, the term "Baitullah" or "the House of God" is used in Surah Al-Imran (3:96) when referring to the place where Moses sought guidance from Allah. In Islamic belief, this refers to Makkah, the birthplace and resting place of Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him, as well as the Kaaba, which Muslims believe was originally built by Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and Ismail (Ishmael).

Regarding the Old Testament scriptures, the temple in Jerusalem is indeed referred to as "the house of Yahweh." The most notable verses are from 1 Kings 8:29 and Jeremiah 7:4 where Solomon prays to dedicate the temple and God warns the Israelites not to treat His house with contempt.

In Islamic tradition, Muslims respect all places of worship as they remind us of the common origin of Abrahamic faiths. We believe that the true 'house of God' is the heart filled with faith and submission to Allah.
