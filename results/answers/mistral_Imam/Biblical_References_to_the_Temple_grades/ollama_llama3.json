  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern by providing some relevant scriptures, but it also strays from the focus of identifying key scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house. The response mentions references to the \"house of Yahweh\" in 1 Kings and Jeremiah, which is a good start, but then veers off into Islamic beliefs and traditions. While these may be interesting and relevant perspectives, they are not directly addressing the concern.\n\nTo improve this grade, the response could have stuck more closely to the task at hand, providing more specific and detailed information about the scriptures that discuss the concept of the temple in relation to God's house."
