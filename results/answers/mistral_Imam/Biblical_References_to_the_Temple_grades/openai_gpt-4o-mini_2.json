  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough comparison between the Islamic belief regarding the \"House of God\" and the Old Testament scriptures referencing the temple as the \"house of Yahweh.\" The student effectively highlighted the difference in terminology and significance in these religions. However, the response lacks a direct engagement with the concern by not explicitly referencing the key scriptures provided in the answer (\"1 Kings 8:44, 2 Chronicles 6:4\") in discussing the concept of the temple as God's house in the Old Testament. Integrating these specific verses would have strengthened the response."
