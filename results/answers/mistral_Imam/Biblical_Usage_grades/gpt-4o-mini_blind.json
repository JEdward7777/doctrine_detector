The explanation of its usage in the Old Testament, particularly in relation to key figures like prophets and kings, is well articulated. The inclusion of the original Hebrew and Arabic terms adds depth to the discussion. However, the mention of Muslims and their connection to biblical genealogies feels somewhat tangential to the main focus of the question, which is on the usage within the Bible itself. Overall, the answer demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but could be refined by staying more closely aligned with the specific context of the biblical genealogy accounts."
