They connected the use of \"begat\" to key biblical figures and highlighted its importance for both Judaism and Christianity. The addition of how genealogies play a role in Islamic history was insightful, although a more focused explanation on the Christian perspective would have been beneficial. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the topic."
