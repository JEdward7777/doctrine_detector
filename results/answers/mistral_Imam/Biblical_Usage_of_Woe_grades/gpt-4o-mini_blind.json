  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComments: The student accurately provides examples of where the term \"woe\" is used in the Book of Isaiah to express God's displeasure and judgment against wrongdoers. However, the student's response concludes with a statement attributing the importance of reflecting on actions, repentance, and striving towards righteousness to Islamic teachings rather than emphasizing the biblical perspective on the consequences of sin and God's judgment. This departure from a Christian worldview perspective impacts the doctrinal correctness of the response. To improve the grade, the student should focus on highlighting the biblical principles of judgment, repentance, and righteousness without introducing teachings from other faith traditions."
