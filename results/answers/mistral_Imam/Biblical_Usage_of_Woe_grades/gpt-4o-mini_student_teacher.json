  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student provided examples of the term \"woe\" being used in the Book of Isaiah to convey God's judgment, which aligns with the request. However, the response did not demonstrate depth in examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. Additionally, the student incorrectly identified as a Muslim Imam, which is a concern when responding from a Christian worldview perspective. More focus on the severity and implications of divine judgment as revealed in the examples provided from a Christian viewpoint would have improved the answer."
