The examples given are relevant and support the explanation well. The integration of Christian Old Testament passages aligns with the concern of examining the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. However, the mention of being a Muslim Imam at the end slightly detracts from the overall Christian perspective of the answer."
