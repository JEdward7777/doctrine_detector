The examples cited effectively demonstrate God's judgment upon unrighteousness and emphasize the seriousness of divine judgment as expressed through scripture. The connection to Islamic teachings at the end, while providing additional perspective, slightly detracts from maintaining a consistent Christian worldview in the discussion."
