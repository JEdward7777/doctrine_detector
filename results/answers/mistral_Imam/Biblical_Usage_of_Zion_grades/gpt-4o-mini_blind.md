## [Answer](../Biblical_Usage_of_Zion.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, the term "Zion" has several figurative meanings:
1. Jerusalem: Zion often represents the city of Jerusalem, which was considered sacred by the Israelites. It was seen as the center of worship and the place where God chose to put his name (Deuteronomy 12:5, 2 Samuel 5:7).
2. Mountain of God: Zion is also used symbolically to refer to a mountain or a high place where the presence of God dwells. In Psalm 48:2, it says, "Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion on the sides of the north, the city of the great King."
3. Kingdom of God: In some passages, Zion is used to symbolize the kingdom or dominion of God (Isaiah 24:23, Joel 2:32). It represents the place where righteousness and peace are established (Psalm 87:3).
4. Heavenly Jerusalem: In the New Testament, Zion is used to refer to the heavenly city of God or the church of believers (Hebrews 12:22-24, Revelation 21:2, 10). It is seen as a place of eternal peace and happiness.

It is important to note that the term "Zion" has different connotations in Islamic tradition, and Muslims refer to Jerusalem as Al-Quds (The Holy City) or Bayt al-Muqaddas (Noble Sanctuary).
