## Question [Building Materials](../../questions/Building_Materials.md)
What materials were commonly used to construct altars during biblical times?

## Target answer from notes
Altars were often made from packed dirt or large stones. Some special altars were constructed from wood overlaid with metals like gold, brass, or bronze.

## Concern to grade by
Knowing the materials and structure of altars can deepen a Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship.

## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Biblical texts, the concept of an "altar" is associated with various practices in the religious traditions of the Israelites and other ancient peoples in the region. The materials for altars varied among these different groups. However, in the Jewish tradition, as described in the Old Testament, altars were typically made from unhewn stones (Exodus 20:25) or earth (Genesis 8:20). Sometimes, they were constructed with wood (1 Kings 13:5), but it's important to note that these altars were never sacred objects themselves, as the true focus of worship was always directed towards God.

In the context of other ancient Near Eastern cultures mentioned in the Bible, materials for altars could include stone, bronze, or even metal. For instance, Abraham built an altar using "three stones" (Genesis 12:8) and Solomon's Temple had a bronze altar (2 Chronicles 4:1).

These examples illustrate the diversity of materials used for altars in biblical times. It is essential to remember that these practices were specific to their cultural contexts and should not be equated with Muslim traditions or religious practices today. In Islam, there are no physical altars as part of our worship. Mosques do not have altars because Muslims do not offer sacrifices on any altar; rather, they stand in prayer towards the Kaaba in Makkah (the Qibla).
