  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer detailing the diverse materials used for constructing altars in biblical times, referencing specific verses and examples from the Old Testament. The inclusion of information about altars in other ancient Near Eastern cultures added depth to the response. However, the student veered off-topic by discussing Muslim traditions and practices towards the end, which was not directly related to the question about altars in biblical times. Overall, a solid understanding of the topic was demonstrated with room for improvement in maintaining focus on the Christian-specific worldview."
