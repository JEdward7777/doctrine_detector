It provides relevant examples from the Old Testament and other ancient Near Eastern cultures. Additionally, the student acknowledges the cultural context of these practices and appropriately differentiates them from contemporary religious traditions. However, including a brief elaboration on the significance of materials like gold or brass in some altars would further enhance the response."
