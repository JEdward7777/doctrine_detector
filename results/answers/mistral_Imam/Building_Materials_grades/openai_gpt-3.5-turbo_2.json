The explanation that altars were never considered sacred objects themselves but rather tools for directing worship towards God aligns well with a Christian worldview. However, the inclusion of examples from other ancient Near Eastern cultures and the comparison with Muslim practices, while informative, somewhat detracts from the focus on deepening a Christian's understanding of biblical practices specifically. Nevertheless, the response effectively addresses the concern raised."
