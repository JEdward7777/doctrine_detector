The additional information about altars in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, such as Abraham's altar and Solomon's bronze altar, further enriches the understanding of the topic. The connection to modern Muslim practices is a helpful contrast, highlighting the unique aspects of Christian worship practices. This response effectively addresses the concern by deepening the Christian's understanding of biblical practices and the reverence associated with worship."
