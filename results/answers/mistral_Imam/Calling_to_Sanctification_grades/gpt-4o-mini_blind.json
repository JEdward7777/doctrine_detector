However, from a Christian worldview, there are doctrinal differences regarding the understanding of personal sanctification, especially concerning the role of works in salvation and the concept of Allah. The response does not address the Christian perspective on personal sanctification specifically, which is crucial in answering the question from a Christian worldview."
