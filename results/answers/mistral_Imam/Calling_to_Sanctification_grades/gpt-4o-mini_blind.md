## [Answer](../Calling_to_Sanctification.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim Imam, I would refer to the Hadith of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) that states: "The most beloved of actions to Allah are the most regular and constant even though they may be little." (Bukhari and Muslim).

This command is about the ongoing effort towards personal sanctification, or Taqwa in Arabic. It involves living a life that adheres to the teachings of Islam, constantly striving to improve one's character, and maintaining a deep consciousness and fear of Allah (God) in all actions. This is achieved through regular worship, such as Salah (prayer), Zakat (charity), and recitation of the Quran, as well as good deeds, sincerity, and avoiding sins.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) also said: "Taqwa is here" - pointing to his chest three times - "and Taqwa is here" - pointing to his forehead twice. Then he said: "A person will keep on being a believer so long as he loves for the sake of Allah what He loves and hates for the sake of Allah what He hates." (Bukhari)

This hadith emphasizes that personal sanctification is not just about external actions, but also about the intentions behind those actions. A believer's heart should always be filled with love for Allah and a desire to please Him, which will guide their thoughts, words, and deeds towards righteousness.

Grade: 70

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of personal sanctification in Islam and references relevant hadiths to support the explanation. However, from a Christian worldview, there are doctrinal differences regarding the understanding of personal sanctification, especially concerning the role of works in salvation and the concept of Allah. The response does not address the Christian perspective on personal sanctification specifically, which is crucial in answering the question from a Christian worldview.
