  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student's response provides insights into the concept of personal sanctification in Islam and includes relevant Hadiths, it does not directly address the given command specific to believers regarding their personal sanctification. The response does not align with the Christian specific worldview, which is the focus of this grading. The emphasis on personal responsibility in the sanctification process, as per the concern provided, is lacking in the answer."
