  "grade": 20.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThe response, while discussing personal sanctification, does not directly address the command to believers in Jesus to sanctify themselves to God. Instead, it references Islamic teachings and concepts, such as Hadith and Taqwa, which are foreign to the original command being discussed.\n\nFurthermore, the concern about emphasizing personal responsibility is only marginally addressed through the discussion of regular worship and good deeds. However, the focus on intentions behind actions is a positive aspect that shows some consideration for personal responsibility in sanctification.\n\nOverall, while the response demonstrates some understanding of personal sanctification, it does not adequately address the original command or the specified concern, resulting in a low grade."
