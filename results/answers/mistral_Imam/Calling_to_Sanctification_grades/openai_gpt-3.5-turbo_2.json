The emphasis on regular worship, striving for improvement, and maintaining conscious awareness aligns well with the Christian concept of sanctification and personal responsibility in the process of becoming holy as commanded by Jesus. The integration of the Islamic view with the specified concern receives high marks for addressing the importance of personal responsibility in the sanctification process."
