The emphasis on regular and constant efforts towards personal sanctification, as well as the importance of intentions and inner beliefs, resonates with the Christian teachings on sanctification. The reference to the Hadith of Prophet Muhammad is insightful and provides a valuable perspective on personal responsibility in the sanctification process from an Islamic point of view. Overall, this response effectively addresses the concern raised within a Christian specific worldview."
