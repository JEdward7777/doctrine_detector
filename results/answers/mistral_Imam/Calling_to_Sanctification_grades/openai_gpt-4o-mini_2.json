  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a well-articulated explanation from an Islamic perspective on the importance of personal sanctification and constant effort towards righteousness based on Islamic teachings and Hadiths of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). While the response does not directly address the specific concern of personal responsibility in the sanctification process according to a Christian worldview, it effectively conveys the concept of personal accountability and continuous striving for holiness in the context of Islam. However, since the response does not directly engage with the concern from a Christian specific worldview, a grade of 70 is given."
