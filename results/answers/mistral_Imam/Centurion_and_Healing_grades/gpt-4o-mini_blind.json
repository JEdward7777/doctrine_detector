  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response shows a good understanding of the story of the Centurion and Jesus from the Bible. However, there are fundamental doctrinal inaccuracies in the conclusion where the student tries to overlap Christian and Muslim beliefs. From a Christian perspective, it is important to maintain the distinctiveness of Christian faith and not mix it with beliefs from other religions. Encouraging the student to focus solely on Christian doctrine related to faith and authority would improve the grade significantly."
