The integration of biblical references and the explanation of faith, humility, and trust are well-done. However, the response could have been further strengthened by directly addressing the Christian worldview and emphasizing Jesus as the Son of God who has ultimate authority. Additionally, while the connection to the Islamic faith is interesting, focusing more on how the Christian principles discussed apply to believers today would have been more relevant."
