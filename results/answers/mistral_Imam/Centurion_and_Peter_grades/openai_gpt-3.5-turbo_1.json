It effectively connects the biblical story of the Centurion with the broader mission of the Church to reach all nations. However, the response could have further emphasized the unique role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of salvation in contrast to Islamic beliefs. Additionally, clarity could be improved in articulating the distinctiveness of the Christian worldview in comparison to other faith traditions."
