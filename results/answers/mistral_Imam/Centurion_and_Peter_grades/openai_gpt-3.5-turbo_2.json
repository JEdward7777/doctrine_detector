However, there is some confusion in blending Christian and Islamic beliefs, potentially diluting the emphasis on the unique Christian understanding of salvation through Jesus Christ. The focus on the universal nature of God's message is commendable, but the discussion could be strengthened by more clearly articulating the distinct Christian doctrine of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone."
