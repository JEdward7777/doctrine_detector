However, the inclusion of Islamic perspectives, while promoting universal values, detracts from a focused Christian worldview on the mission of the Church and the exclusivity of the Gospel message. A stronger emphasis on the distinct Christian belief in the centrality of Jesus Christ for salvation would have enhanced the response from a Christian-specific perspective."
