However, the comparison with the Islamic perspective, while insightful, may not fully align with a Christian worldview as it suggests an equivalency between the teachings of Jesus and Islam. A stronger emphasis on the uniqueness of Christ as the only way to salvation according to Christian doctrine would have enhanced the discussion."
