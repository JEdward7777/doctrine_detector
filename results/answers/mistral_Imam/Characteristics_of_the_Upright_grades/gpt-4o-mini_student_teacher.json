  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of qualities that align well with the biblical context of an upright person. They emphasized important virtues such as faithfulness, justice, humility, compassion, wisdom, righteousness, patience, self-control, and honesty. While their answer was thorough and insightful, there could be a slight improvement by focusing more on the core aspect of obedience to God's laws and living a God-pleasing life, as highlighted in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
