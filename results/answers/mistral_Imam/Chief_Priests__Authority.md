## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Jewish religious system during the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), there were indeed different levels of religious leaders, including High Priests (Kohanim) and ordinary priests (Levites). The High Priest was considered the most significant among them, as he was responsible for performing many important rituals on behalf of the Jewish community in the Temple in Jerusalem.

The ordinary priests, or Levites, were also essential figures who assisted the High Priest in religious duties and worked primarily at the local synagogues outside Jerusalem. They played a crucial role in teaching Torah, leading prayers, and offering guidance to the people.

However, it's important to note that their relationship was not one of authority over one another in the sense of a hierarchical structure, but rather a division of labor and responsibilities based on their roles within the Temple system and broader Jewish community. Both High Priests and ordinary priests were part of the same religious class (the descendants of Aaron) and shared similar duties and obligations, such as upholding Jewish law, teaching the Torah, and ensuring the proper observance of religious practices among the people.

This relationship can be seen as a reminder for Muslim leaders to prioritize unity, cooperation, and mutual respect within the community, while recognizing that each person has their unique role to play in serving Allah and uplifting humanity.
