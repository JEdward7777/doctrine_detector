  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides some relevant information about the roles of High Priests and ordinary priests in the Jewish religious system during the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, the answer does not directly address the relationship between chief priests and ordinary priests in terms of authority as requested in the question based on the reference answer provided by the teacher. The answer also includes a comparison to Muslim leaders which is not relevant to the context of the question. More focus on the specific authority dynamics between chief priests and ordinary priests in ancient Israel would have strengthened the response."
