It correctly addresses the concern by explaining the roles and relationships of High Priests and ordinary priests within the Jewish religious system. The response also draws parallels to encourage Muslim leaders towards unity, cooperation, and mutual respect within their community. However, the response could have further emphasized the spiritual significance of the High Priest role and the importance of their duties in offering sacrifices for the people's sins, reflecting God's requirements for atonement in the Old Testament."
