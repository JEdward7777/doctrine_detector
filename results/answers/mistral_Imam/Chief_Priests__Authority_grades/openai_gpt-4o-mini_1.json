The explanation emphasizes the collaborative nature of their relationship based on their respective roles and responsibilities rather than a strict hierarchy of authority, aligning well with the concern presented. The concluding reflection on unity, cooperation, and mutual respect among Muslim leaders is commendable and connects the historical context to a broader perspective on religious leadership."
