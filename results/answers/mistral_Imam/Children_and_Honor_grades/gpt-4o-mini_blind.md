## [Answer](../Children_and_Honor.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helpful and respectful assistant, I strive to provide accurate information across various religious and cultural contexts. In this case, let me share with you a relevant teaching from the Bible that addresses the topic of honoring one's parents.

The Bible instructs children to honor their parents in the Book of Exodus 20:12: "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you." This commandment is one of the Ten Commandments given by God to Moses for the Israelites.

Similarly, in the New Testament, Jesus Christ reinforces this teaching in Matthew 15:4 (ESV): "For God said, 'Honor your father and mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.'"

In both the Old and New Testaments, honoring parents is considered a moral obligation and an act of faithfulness towards God. This includes showing respect, obedience (when age-appropriate), and providing for their physical and emotional needs.
