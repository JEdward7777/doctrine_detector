The explanation is informative and well-structured. However, there is room for improvement by incorporating more specific examples or verses from the New Testament that illustrate the evolving usage of the term 'Christ'. Additionally, mentioning the significance of Jesus' sacrificial death and resurrection in relation to his role as Christ would further enhance the theological depth of the answer."
