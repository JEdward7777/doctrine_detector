  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of how modern Christians might adopt practices to reflect the Old Testament concept of ritual cleanliness. However, there are a few areas that could be improved. The student could have emphasized more explicitly the symbolic significance of ritual cleanliness in the Old Testament and how that translates into Christian practices. Additionally, the student could have mentioned the importance of heart purity and inner cleanliness as emphasized in the New Testament, as these aspects are crucial in understanding the continuum of cleanliness from the Old to the New Testament. Furthermore, the student could have highlighted the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate cleanser and how His sacrifice fulfills the need for ritual cleanliness in the Old Testament."
