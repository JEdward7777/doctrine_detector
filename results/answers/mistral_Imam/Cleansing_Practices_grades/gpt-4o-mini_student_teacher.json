The examples given, such as baptism, handwashing, food regulations, church cleanliness, and personal hygiene, effectively draw connections to ancient teachings. However, the answer could have been improved by focusing more on core spiritual practices like repentance, confession, and spiritual discipline as emphasized in the reference answer. It is important to highlight these central elements of seeking moral and spiritual cleanliness in a Christian context."
