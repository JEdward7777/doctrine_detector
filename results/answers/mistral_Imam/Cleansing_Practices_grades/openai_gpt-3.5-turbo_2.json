The examples provided, such as baptism, handwashing, food regulations, church cleanliness, and personal hygiene, effectively connect Old Testament concepts of ritual cleanliness to modern Christian practices. The response could be improved by further discussing how these practices specifically contribute to spiritual growth and accountability in a practical sense."
