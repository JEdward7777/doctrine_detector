  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written explanation of what having a clear conscience means in Christian teachings, citing relevant scripture and drawing parallels to other religious traditions. However, the answer could have been more focused on the Christian perspective specifically, emphasizing the importance of being in obedience to God and maintaining moral integrity in alignment with His will. Further exploration of the significance of repentance and seeking forgiveness in the Christian context would have strengthened the response. Overall, a solid effort with room for improvement in aligning with the Christian worldview."
