  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough analysis of the biblical passage using Psalms 49:12-20 and offered insights into the metaphorical significance of humans being compared to sheep. While the discussion on the transient nature of material wealth and the importance of faith was valuable, the answer could have more explicitly emphasized the vulnerability of humans and their need for divine guidance, as indicated in the concern provided. Additionally, the inclusion of a perspective from Islam, while interesting, deviated from the Christian-specific worldview requested in the concern."
