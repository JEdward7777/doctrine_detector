## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations, but I can certainly help you find examples of compassion in the Bible from a Muslim perspective, as many values are shared between Islam and Christianity. Here are some notable examples:

1. Moses and the Egyptians (Exodus 2:6): When Pharaoh's daughter found Moses in the bulrushes, she took pity on him and raised him as her own child. This demonstrates compassion towards an infant in danger.

2. Elijah and the Widow of Zarephath (1 Kings 17:8-24): During a severe famine, God commanded Elijah to go to a town called Zarephath where a widow would provide him with food and shelter. The widow showed compassion by sharing her last meal with Elijah, only to have it miraculously multiplied.

3. Jesus and the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37): In response to a question about what it means to love one's neighbor, Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan. A Samaritan, known for their kindness to strangers, stopped to help a Jew who had been beaten and left by the side of the road. The Samaritan took care of his wounds, provided shelter, and even paid for his continued care. This story illustrates compassion towards an enemy.

4. Jesus healing the leper (Matthew 8:1-4): When a leper approached Jesus, he reached out in compassion and healed him, restoring him to society. Lepers were considered unclean and were often shunned by others in that time period.

These stories, among many others, demonstrate the importance of compassion in both the Christian and Muslim traditions. In Islam, the concept is expressed through the Arabic word 'Rahmah,' which encompasses love, mercy, and compassion.
