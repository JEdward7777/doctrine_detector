  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided relevant examples of compassion from the Bible, showcasing empathy and care towards others in various situations. However, the student answered the question from a Muslim perspective rather than focusing on the requested Christian viewpoint. While there are shared values between Islam and Christianity, the concern specified a Christian worldview for the examples of compassion. Encouraging a more tailored biblical perspective would have strengthened the response."
