The inclusion of baptism, communal renewal through revival, and the ultimate cosmic renewal align well with Christian beliefs. However, the mention of the Islamic concept of 'Tajdid' detracts from the focus on the transformative power of faith and God's work in a believer's life from a Christian worldview. The student could have further emphasized the importance of God's role in the process of restoration and renewal."
