It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the transformative power of faith in believers' lives and God's ongoing work in restoring them to their intended purpose. The inclusion of scriptural references adds depth and authenticity to the explanation. The deduction in points is due to the inclusion of the comparison with the Islamic concept of 'Tajdid,' which, while insightful, slightly detracts from a purely Christian worldview perspective."
