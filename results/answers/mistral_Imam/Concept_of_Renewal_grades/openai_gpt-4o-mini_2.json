It addresses the concern by highlighting the transformative power of faith and emphasizing God's ongoing work in believers' lives. The response also appropriately connects this concept to believers being made new in Christ and aligns well with Christian teachings on restoration and renewal. However, deducting a small number of points for briefly referencing the Islamic concept of Tajdid, which while informative, is somewhat tangential to the core Christian perspective being discussed."
