The student should have engaged with the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 from a Christian standpoint, emphasizing the Christian understanding of punishment, mercy, and condemnation. A more appropriate approach would have been to delve into the teachings of Jesus and the Psalms within the framework of Christian theology."
