  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the student attempted to provide insights into the interpretation of the verses in an Islamic context, it does not align with the concern provided from a Christian worldview. The student's answer lacks engagement with the specific concern of balancing divine justice and mercy in understanding punishment. Additionally, the perspective presented is not rooted in a Christian interpretation of the verses in question. The response would have been stronger if it directly addressed how the teachings in Matthew 12:7 and Psalms 34:22 from a Christian perspective offer a balance between justice and mercy in the context of punishment."
