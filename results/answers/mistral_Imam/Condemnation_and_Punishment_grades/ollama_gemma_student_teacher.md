## [Answer](../Condemnation_and_Punishment.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations, but I can help you understand how these verses are often interpreted in the Islamic context.

1. Matthew 12:7 (New International Version): "But if you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent." This verse is often interpreted in Islam to emphasize God's mercy and compassion. It suggests that God does not wish for harshness or condemnation, but rather for mercy and understanding. This aligns with Islamic teachings where forgiveness and mercy are highly valued attributes.

2. Psalms 34:22 (New International Version): "The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit." This verse highlights God's closeness to those who are suffering and His role as a savior for those who are downcast. In Islam, this echoes the belief in Allah's mercy and compassion towards His creation, especially those who are afflicted or troubled.

In both cases, these verses can be seen as emphasizing God's desire for mercy, compassion, and saving those who are suffering. Punishment should not be viewed as a form of condemnation but rather as an opportunity for repentance, reform, and growth. This perspective is consistent with the Islamic principle of 'Adl (Justice), which emphasizes that punishment should serve a reformatory purpose rather than being retributive or vindictive.

**Grade: 85/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical passages and their relevance to the concern of balancing divine justice and mercy. It highlights the Islamic perspective on mercy and compassion as central attributes of God, aligning with the reference answer. The explanation of the principle of 'Adl further strengthens the argument by emphasizing the reformatory purpose of punishment. However, the response could benefit from additional elaboration on how these teachings apply to the specific context of punishment as a form of condemnation.
