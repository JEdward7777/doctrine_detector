  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the verses within an Islamic context, highlighting the themes of mercy, compassion, and salvation. It effectively addresses the concern by discussing punishment as an opportunity for growth and repentance, aligning with the principle of justice as a reformatory process. However, it lacks depth in explicitly addressing the Christian perspective on divine justice and mercy, which is essential for a complete evaluation from a Christian worldview. Further integration of Christian views on the balance of justice and mercy would enhance the grade."
