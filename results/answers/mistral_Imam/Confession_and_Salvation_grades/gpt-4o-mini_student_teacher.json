  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation about the significance of confessing Jesus as Lord within Christian theology and made a valid comparison to Islamic beliefs. However, the student's answer lacked specific reference to Paul's writings and did not directly address the concern about the theological implications of confession and belief in salvation according to Paul. The response could have been improved by focusing more on Paul's explicit teachings on this topic."
