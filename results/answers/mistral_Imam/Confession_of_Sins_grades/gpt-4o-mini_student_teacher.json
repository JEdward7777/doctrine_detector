  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough response discussing various ways a Christian should respond when tempted to sin based on Biblical teachings. However, the student focused more on practical steps and advice rather than emphasizing the importance of acknowledging personal sin in relation to God's forgiveness, which was the specified concern. The answer lacked a clear emphasis on the critical aspect of confessing sins to God for forgiveness and strength in fighting against sin, as highlighted in the reference answer. The student's response would have been stronger if it had centered more on the significance of acknowledging personal sin and seeking God's forgiveness as the primary response to temptation."
