  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-researched explanation of the biblical concept of conscience, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. They accurately describe the function of conscience as a moral compass based on God's law, and the importance of aligning one's conscience with Scripture. The only improvement would be to emphasize more clearly that the conscience is a reflection of God's moral standards and not merely personal biases or cultural conditioning."
