  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a detailed explanation of the biblical concept of conscience, drawing from both the Old and New Testaments. They accurately describe the function of conscience as a moral compass based on God's law written in the hearts of individuals. The response also emphasizes the importance of aligning one's conscience with God's Word and seeking guidance from Scripture and other believers when needed. However, the answer could be improved by directly stating that conscience is a part of a person's thinking through which God makes them aware of sin, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
