## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic perspective, the individuals mentioned in the Bible who are regarded as being dedicated or consecrated to God (Allah) include prophets such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and Jesus (peace be upon them all). In Islamic belief, they were all chosen by Allah to deliver His message to humanity. It's worth noting that the stories of these prophets are shared in common between the Bible and Quran but with slight differences in certain details and interpretations due to the different religious contexts. For example, Abraham (Ibrahim) is considered a major prophet in both faiths, but the story of his sacrifice (Isaac or Ishmael) varies between the two sources. In Islam, these individuals are held in high esteem as role models for their unwavering devotion to Allah and their guidance to humanity.
