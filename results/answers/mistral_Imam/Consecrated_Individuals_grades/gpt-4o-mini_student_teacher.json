  "grade": 30.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer does not address the concern of recognizing the significance of consecrated individuals in biblical history from a Christian worldview. The response heavily focuses on Islamic perspectives and beliefs, rather than providing information on individuals specifically consecrated to God in the Bible. Additionally, the student does not mention the priests, the people of Israel, or the oldest male child as stated in the reference answer. Therefore, the grade is significantly lower as the content is not aligned with the Christian-specific perspective requested."
