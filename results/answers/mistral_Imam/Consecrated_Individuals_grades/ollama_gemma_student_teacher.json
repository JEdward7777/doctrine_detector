  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of consecrated individuals in Islamic perspectives, however, it deviates from the Christian-specific worldview provided in the concern. While some prophets mentioned are shared between Islam and Christianity, the focus on Islamic figures and their significance within Islamic belief does not address the Christian concern. The inclusion of irrelevant information for the Christian worldview lowers the grade."
