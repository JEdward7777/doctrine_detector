It also expands on how consecration extends beyond physical acts to metaphorical applications. The response effectively addresses the concern by detailing the purification process involved in consecration and how it makes individuals or things suitable for service to God. The connection between purification and acceptability for divine service is clearly articulated from an Islamic perspective."
