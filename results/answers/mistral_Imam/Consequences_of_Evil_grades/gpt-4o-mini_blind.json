  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this answer a grade of 60. While the student accurately presents information about the consequences of evil as discussed in both Islamic and Biblical contexts, there are some significant issues from a Christian worldview. The student fails to acknowledge the foundational differences between the Islamic and Christian perspectives on salvation, judgment, and God's nature. In a Christian worldview, forgiveness is not solely based on repentance and good deeds, but on faith in Jesus Christ as the atonement for sin. Additionally, the student should have highlighted the central role of Christ's sacrifice on the cross in providing the opportunity for salvation and the forgiveness of sins. The lack of clarity regarding these doctrinal differences lowers the grade significantly."
