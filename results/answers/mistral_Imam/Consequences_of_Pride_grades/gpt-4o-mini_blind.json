  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer with relevant scriptural references from the Book of Proverbs and the teachings of Jesus Christ on pride and humility. The explanation was clear and connected biblical passages effectively to convey the consequences of pride and the importance of humility. However, there was an error in the conclusion stating \"As Muslims and Christians\" which is inaccurate in this context, as the discussion is solely focused on Christian teachings. This detracts from the doctrinal correctness of the response."
