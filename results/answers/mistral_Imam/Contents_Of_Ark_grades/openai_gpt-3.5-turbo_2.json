It acknowledges the Jewish and Christian traditions regarding these objects. However, there is a missed opportunity to engage with the importance of these items as reminders of God's covenant with the Israelites from a Christian worldview. The response could have explored how these objects symbolize God's faithfulness, provision, and moral standards as outlined in the Old Testament."
