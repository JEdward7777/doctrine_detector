  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student demonstrated a solid understanding of the concept of conditional and unconditional covenants in the Bible by providing accurate examples - the Abrahamic Covenant as unconditional and the Mosaic Covenant as conditional. The explanation of each covenant was clear and supported by relevant biblical references. Additionally, the student appropriately highlighted the significance of these covenants in demonstrating God's mercy, justice, and faithfulness throughout history. Overall, a well-written and doctrinally sound response."
