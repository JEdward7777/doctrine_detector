  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: This response effectively explains the concept of unconditional and conditional covenants in the context of Biblical examples, showcasing a good understanding of God's promises and expectations within the covenants. The response uses appropriate references and demonstrates a solid grasp of the Christian worldview on this topic. The only suggestion for improvement would be to include a bit more elaboration or further examples to enhance the depth of the explanation."
