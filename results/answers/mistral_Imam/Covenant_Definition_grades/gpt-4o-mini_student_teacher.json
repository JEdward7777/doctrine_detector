  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate explanation of the nature and significance of covenants in biblical contexts. They correctly highlighted key aspects such as the sacred nature, agreements between God and His people, ceremonies, responsibilities, and examples from both the Old and New Testaments. However, the student could have emphasized the essential aspect of a covenant being a formal and binding agreement more clearly, in line with the reference answer."
