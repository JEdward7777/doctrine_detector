## [Answer](../Covenant_Definition.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Biblical context, a covenant is a sacred agreement or pact between God and individuals or groups, often represented by a ceremony involving symbols such as sacrifices, rituals, or promises. These agreements outline the terms of the relationship between God and His people, including the responsibilities and blessings on each side. The concept of covenant appears frequently in both the Old Testament (Tanakh) and the New Testament, with well-known examples being the Covenant between God and Abraham (Genesis 15), the Mosaic Covenant (Exodus 24), and the New Covenant established by Jesus Christ (Luke 22:20). The covenant serves as a foundation for God's relationship with His chosen people, providing guidance, protection, and promises of blessings for faithfulness.
