It also acknowledges the trials faced when they disobeyed and the rewards for those who remained faithful. \n\nWhile the answer focuses on Islamic tradition, it remains relevant to the Christian concern as both traditions share a common understanding of God's law and its importance in achieving divine promises. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from acknowledging the specific laws or commandments that played a crucial role in the Israelites' journey, rather than referencing a general principle of adhering to Allah's commands."
