It aligns with the concern by emphasizing the essential role of obedience to God's commandments in achieving His promises. The references to Quranic verses and the explanation provided demonstrate a solid understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective. However, a more direct connection to a Christian-specific worldview would have improved the response further."
