However, while it discusses the nature of the covenant in Islam, it does not directly address the concern of recognizing the importance of God's promises and relationship with His chosen people. The response could strengthen its Christian worldview relevance by acknowledging the unique relationship God established with the Israelites as His chosen people and how it relates to the broader concept of God's faithfulness and promises in Christianity."
