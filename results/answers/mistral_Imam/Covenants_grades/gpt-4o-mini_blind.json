The explanation lacks depth in discussing the specific biblical covenants and their implications for God's commitment to His people throughout Scripture. Additionally, referencing the teachings of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad in relation to biblical covenants does not align with a Christian perspective. A more substantial and accurate exploration of how biblical covenants illustrate God's commitment to His people would significantly improve this response."
