  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the relationship between biblical covenants and God's commitment to His people. They clearly explain the concept of covenants and their significance in Islam, while also acknowledging the importance of interpreting these stories within their historical context. The inclusion of references to Islamic beliefs and teachings adds an additional dimension to the analysis. However, minor inaccuracies in referencing Christianity-specific terminology may slightly lower the grade."
