## Question [Cultural Practices](../../../questions/Cultural_Practices.md)
What cultural practices were associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and how did they impact early Christian practices?

## Correct Answer
Jews traditionally avoided eating with or associating with Gentiles, which initially created barriers in the early church, prompting necessary discussions about inclusivity and acceptance.

## Stated Concern
This question examines how cultural norms influence faith communities and their practices.

## [Answer](../Cultural_Practices.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the ancient Jewish context, there were several cultural practices related to their view of Gentiles (non-Jews), which significantly influenced the development of early Christianity. Here are some key aspects:

1. Separation and Holiness (Kashrut): The Jews were commanded to be a holy people set apart from other nations. This separation was manifested in dietary laws (kosher food), prohibitions on intermarriage, and rules about cleanliness and purity. These practices can be seen as a reflection of the Jewish understanding of God's covenant with Israel and their role as a chosen people.

2. Circumcision: Another distinguishing practice was male circumcision on the eighth day after birth, which marked the Jews as set apart by God. This practice also had symbolic significance, representing a covenantal relationship between God and his people.

3. Sabbath Observance: The fourth commandment required the observance of the Sabbath (from Friday evening to Saturday evening) as a day of rest, worship, and reflection. This practice helped maintain the Jewish identity and reinforced their belief in one God who created the universe in six days and rested on the seventh.

Now, let's see how these practices impacted early Christian practices:

1. Dietary Laws: Early Christians initially followed Jewish dietary laws, as described in Acts 10 and 11 when Peter had a vision of clean and unclean animals and was told that God shows no partiality, making all foods clean. However, Paul later wrote in 1 Corinthians 8-10 that while idol meat should be avoided due to its association with pagan practices, food itself is not intrinsically unholy.

2. Circumcision: The Apostle Paul, a Jew, was initially circumcised (Philippians 3:5), but he later argued against the necessity of circumcision for Gentile converts (Galatians 5:6). He maintained that justification comes through faith in Christ alone and not through adherence to Jewish rituals.

3. Sabbath Observance: Early Christians initially continued to observe the Jewish Sabbath, as seen in Acts 13:42-44 and Luke 4:16. However, they eventually began meeting on Sundays (the Day of Resurrection) instead, as described in Acts 20:7 and 1 Corinthians 16:2.

In summary, the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles significantly influenced early Christian practices, but Christianity gradually evolved its own distinct identity through embracing and adapting some of these practices while also rejecting others.

Comment: The response gives a solid overview of the cultural practices associated with the Jewish view of Gentiles and how they impacted early Christian practices. The student effectively connects these practices to key biblical passages and the actions of early Christian figures like Peter and Paul. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the subject matter, but could benefit from further elaboration on how the Christian view of Gentiles evolved and the theological implications of these changes.
