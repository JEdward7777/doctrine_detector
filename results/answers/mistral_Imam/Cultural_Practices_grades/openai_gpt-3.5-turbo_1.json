The response effectively explained how early Christians initially followed Jewish practices but eventually developed their distinct identity through the teachings and actions of figures like the Apostle Paul. The integration of scriptural references and historical context demonstrated a strong understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The answer effectively addresses the concern raised regarding cultural norms influencing faith communities and their practices."
