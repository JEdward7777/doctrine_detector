It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the broader theological implications of sin and the need for redemption, connecting the significance of the curse on the snake to the concept of redemption through Christ in Christianity. More elaboration on the unique Christian belief in the redemption through Christ and how it relates to the story of Adam and Eve could further enhance the response."
