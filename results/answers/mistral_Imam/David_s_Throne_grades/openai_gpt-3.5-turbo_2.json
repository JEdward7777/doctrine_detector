It effectively connects the Old Testament passages with the New Testament references to Jesus as the Son of David and emphasizes his royal lineage, divine nature, and eternal rule. The explanation demonstrates a strong understanding of the significance of this promise in Christianity and its fulfillment through Jesus."
