However, it is important to note that the explanation could have been more focused on the Christian perspective without diluting it by bringing in Islamic beliefs. While acknowledging the similarities and differences between religions can be beneficial, in this context, the emphasis should have been on clearly articulating the Christian understanding of the \"Day of the Lord\" in the New Testament. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications and biblical references pertaining to this event."
