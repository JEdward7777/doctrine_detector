However, there could have been more emphasis on the distinct Christian beliefs regarding the 'Day of the Lord' and its importance within Christian eschatology. The response could have further elaborated on the specific aspects of judgment and the second coming of Christ in Christian theology to provide a more thorough Christian worldview perspective."
