However, the concern of understanding the biblical role of servanthood in the church is not fully addressed in the response. While the roles described in the Islamic context are beneficial and important for community support, the essence of servanthood as modeled by Jesus Christ in Christian teaching may not be fully captured. An understanding of servanthood includes humility, sacrificial love, and selfless service, which could have been further emphasized in the response."
