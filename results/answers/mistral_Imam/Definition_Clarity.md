## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or faith, but I can share information based on various religious texts. In the Christian context, adultery is defined primarily in the Bible, specifically in the New Testament of the Holy Bible in Matthew 5:27-28, Mark 7:21-23, and Luke 16:18.

Adultery is considered to be any sexual activity outside of marriage between a man and a woman. This includes extramarital sex, intercourse with a partner who is not your spouse, and even looking at someone with lustful intentions (as per Matthew 5:27-28). It's important to note that these definitions can vary slightly among different Christian denominations and interpretations.

In the Old Testament (Leviticus 20:10), adultery is defined more broadly as unfaithfulness in a marital relationship, including sexual relations with a stepmother, stepsister, mother-in-law, or any other close relative, in addition to extramarital affairs.

Again, I encourage you to consult with religious scholars or leaders for a more comprehensive understanding of these concepts within the Christian faith.
