  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The response accurately references biblical passages that address adultery in both the Old and New Testaments. However, it lacks depth in explaining the gravity and consequences of adultery in the Christian context, as well as the significance of marriage as a sacred covenant. Additionally, the disclaimer about not having personal beliefs or faith may be seen as an unnecessary distancing from the topic. More emphasis on the moral implications of adultery according to Christian doctrine would have strengthened the response."
