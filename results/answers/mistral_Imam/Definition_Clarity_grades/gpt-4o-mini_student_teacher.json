  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive explanation of adultery in the Christian context, referencing both the Old and New Testaments. They accurately highlight the various aspects of adultery according to scripture. However, the student could have emphasized more clearly the foundational Christian belief that adultery is specifically the act of marital infidelity, without delving into other forms of unfaithfulness. Additionally, while their response is informative, it lacks a deep theological analysis or personal reflection from a Christian worldview."
