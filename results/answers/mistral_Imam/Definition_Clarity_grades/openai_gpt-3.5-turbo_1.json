  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the Biblical definition of adultery from both the Old and New Testaments, referencing specific verses and highlighting the broader concept of unfaithfulness within marriage. The inclusion of various references enhances the understanding of the topic within a Christian context. The use of scripture to support the definition aligns well with a Christian worldview. The only suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate a brief conclusion summarizing the significance and implications of adultery within the Christian faith."
