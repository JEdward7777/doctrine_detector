However, from a Christian perspective, it would be important to emphasize the unique role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate intercessor between humanity and God, as highlighted in passages such as Hebrews 7:25. Furthermore, the emphasis on individuals acting as intercessors in Islamic belief should be contrasted with the Christian belief in the exclusive intercessory role of Jesus Christ."
