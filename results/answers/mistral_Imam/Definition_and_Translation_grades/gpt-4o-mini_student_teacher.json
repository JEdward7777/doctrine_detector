  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thoughtful and comprehensive list of alternative translations for the term 'intercede,' showing a good understanding of the concept and its implications in different contexts, including Islamic beliefs. However, the student's answer was more focused on Islamic interpretations and lacked a direct reference to Christian scripture or theology, as requested in the question. Connecting the provided alternatives to Christian concepts of intercession would have strengthened the response."
