  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear explanation of various terms and phrases related to intercession in Islamic contexts, which helps to clarify the meaning and application of intercession in different settings. The examples provided are relevant and well-explained, making it easy for readers to understand how these concepts can be applied in different situations.\n\nHowever, I would deduct a few points because the response does not directly address the concern about clarifying the meaning and application of intercession in different contexts. While the response does provide some helpful examples, it could have been more explicit in explaining how these concepts can be applied in different contexts, such as in everyday life or in different religious traditions.\n\nOverall, the response is well-written and provides a good overview of the concept of intercession in Islamic contexts. With a bit more focus on clarifying the meaning and application of intercession in different contexts, it could have received an even higher grade."
