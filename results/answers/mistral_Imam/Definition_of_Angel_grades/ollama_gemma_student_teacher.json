  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and informative response that clearly articulates the biblical definition of an angel and their primary role. The student demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject matter and provides comprehensive explanations supported by relevant biblical references. However, it would benefit from a more concise conclusion that explicitly reinforces the main points."
