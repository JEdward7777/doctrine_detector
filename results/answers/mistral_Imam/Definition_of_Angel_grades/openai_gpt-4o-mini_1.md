## [Answer](../Definition_of_Angel.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a scholar, I should clarify that while Islam and Christianity share many similarities, they have distinct beliefs about angels due to different scriptures. However, I can certainly provide you with the biblical understanding of angels based on Christian sources.

In Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, angels are spiritual beings created by God. They are often described as messengers who carry out divine tasks or deliver divine revelations to humans.

According to the Bible, angels serve God faithfully (Revelation 14:6-7), worship Him continuously (Revelation 4:8-11), and execute His will in various ways (Genesis 3:24; Matthew 1:20). They are also thought to protect, guide, and minister to humans (Psalm 91:11-12; Hebrews 1:14).

One of the most famous angelic appearances in the Bible is the Annunciation, where the angel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would conceive and give birth to Jesus, the Son of God (Luke 1:26-38). Angels also played significant roles in other biblical events such as the creation story (Genesis 1), the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19), and the prophet Daniel's visions (Daniel 7-12).

In summary, angels are spiritual beings created by God who serve Him and carry out His will, often acting as messengers to humans or protecting and guiding them. The primary role of an angel, according to biblical accounts, is to faithfully serve and worship God while fulfilling various tasks at His discretion.
