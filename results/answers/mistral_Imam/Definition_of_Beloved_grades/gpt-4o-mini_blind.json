The references to specific biblical verses support the explanation well. However, the comparison made with Islam at the end may not align perfectly with a Christian-specific worldview, as the concept of beloved in Christianity is uniquely tied to Christ as the ultimate expression of God's love for humanity. It is important to focus on the distinctiveness of Christian beliefs in discussing theological terms."
