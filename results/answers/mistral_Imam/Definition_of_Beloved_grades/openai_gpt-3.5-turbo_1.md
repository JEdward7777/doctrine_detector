## [Answer](../Definition_of_Beloved.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In a Biblical context, the term "beloved" is used to express deep affection, love, or favor. It is often used by God to address people like Moses, Jeremiah, and the prophet John. For instance, in the Gospel of Luke (3:22), it is said that at his baptism, Jesus was "well pleased" with him, and God's voice declared, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well-pleased."

It also signifies God's love for humanity, as in John 16:27 where Jesus says, "And whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it." In the Old Testament, Hosea 11:4 states, "I led them with cords of kindness, with bands of love, and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them."

In these passages and many others, we see that 'beloved' implies a deep, loving relationship between God and his chosen people or individuals. This concept is similar in Islam where Prophets such as Moses, Abraham, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all) are considered the beloved of Allah due to their close connection and obedience.
