  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"church\" in the New Testament, emphasizing its spiritual community aspect beyond just a building. While the student's answer included the role of the church and its functions, the reference answer specified it as all people who believe in Jesus, often in a local assembly context. The student's response could have been improved by focusing more on the inclusiveness of believers in defining the church, as highlighted in the reference answer."
