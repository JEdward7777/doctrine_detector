 In the New Testament, the term "church" refers to a spiritual community or assembly of believers in Jesus Christ. It is derived from the Greek word "ekklesia," which means a called-out gathering. This congregation of believers is considered the body of Christ, united by faith in Him and His teachings. The church is also a place for worship, fellowship, teaching, and service. It serves as a spiritual family where Christians can support one another, grow in their faith, and share the message of love, peace, and salvation through Jesus Christ with the world.
