However, there are a couple of points that could be improved for a higher grade. Firstly, the mention of seeking absolution from a priest for confession is more specific to certain Christian traditions (such as Catholicism) and may not be universally applicable across all denominations. Secondly, while the inclusion of Islamic teachings on repentance is informative, a more focused comparison between Christian confession and Islamic Tawba would have been more relevant for the question. More emphasis on the centrality of Christ in the forgiveness of sins for Christians could also enhance the answer."
