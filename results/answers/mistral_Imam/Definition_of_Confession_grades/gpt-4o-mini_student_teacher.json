However, the answer could have been stronger by focusing more on the biblical context of confession and how it relates to Christian beliefs and practices. Additionally, the inclusion of information about confession in the Quran, while informative, was not directly relevant to the question asked. Improving the clarity and depth of biblical explanation would enhance the overall response."
