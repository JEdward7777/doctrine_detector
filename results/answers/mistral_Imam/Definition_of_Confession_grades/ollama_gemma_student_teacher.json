  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical concept of confession, providing clear explanations from both the Old and New Testaments. They also correctly highlight the importance of both private and public confession in Christian belief. The inclusion of information regarding the Islamic concept of \"Tawba\" adds an interesting comparative element to the response. However, the response could benefit from a stronger elaboration on the connection between confession and forgiveness in Christian theology."
