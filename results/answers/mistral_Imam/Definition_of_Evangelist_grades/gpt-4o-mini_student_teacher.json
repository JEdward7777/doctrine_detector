  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student correctly identifies the Christian context of the term \"evangelist\" and its role in sharing the Gospel. However, the student's answer goes off topic by explaining the difference in terminology between Christianity and Islam, which was not the focus of the question. The response could have delved deeper into the specific duties and significance of an evangelist in sharing the Christian gospel to receive a higher grade."
