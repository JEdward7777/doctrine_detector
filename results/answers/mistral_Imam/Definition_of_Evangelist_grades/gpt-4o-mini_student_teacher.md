What is the literal meaning of the term 'evangelist'?

## Correct Answer
The literal meaning of 'evangelist' is 'someone who preaches the good news.'

## Stated Concern
Understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel.

## [Answer](../Definition_of_Evangelist.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In its original Christian context, an "Evangelist" is a person who shares the Gospel (the good news of Jesus Christ) to others. However, the term doesn't have a specific meaning within Islamic tradition or vocabulary. Muslims do not refer to themselves as evangelists because the Quran and Sunnah encourage communication about Islam through peaceful means and respect for other religions. Instead, Muslims may be called 'Da'iyyah' (inviter) or 'Dakwah' worker (one who carries out dakwah), which refers to a person who calls others to Islam through dialogue, education, or example-setting.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student correctly identifies the Christian context of the term "evangelist" and its role in sharing the Gospel. However, the student's answer goes off topic by explaining the difference in terminology between Christianity and Islam, which was not the focus of the question. The response could have delved deeper into the specific duties and significance of an evangelist in sharing the Christian gospel to receive a higher grade.
