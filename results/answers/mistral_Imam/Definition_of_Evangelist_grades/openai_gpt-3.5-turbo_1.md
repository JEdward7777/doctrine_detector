What is the literal meaning of the term 'evangelist'?

# Correct Answer
The literal meaning of 'evangelist' is 'someone who preaches the good news.'

# Stated Concern
Understanding the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel.

# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In its original Christian context, an "Evangelist" is a person who shares the Gospel (the good news of Jesus Christ) to others. However, the term doesn't have a specific meaning within Islamic tradition or vocabulary. Muslims do not refer to themselves as evangelists because the Quran and Sunnah encourage communication about Islam through peaceful means and respect for other religions. Instead, Muslims may be called 'Da'iyyah' (inviter) or 'Dakwah' worker (one who carries out dakwah), which refers to a person who calls others to Islam through dialogue, education, or example-setting.

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term "evangelist" in its original Christian context and contrasts it effectively with terms used in Islamic tradition. It demonstrates a good understanding of the role of an evangelist in sharing the gospel within a Christian worldview. The response could be further strengthened by incorporating scripture references or theological insights to deepen the Christian perspective on evangelism.
