  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response accurately explains the original Christian context of an evangelist as someone who shares the Gospel, and clarifies that this term does not have a direct equivalent in Islamic tradition. It demonstrates knowledge of the role of an evangelist in Christian beliefs and how it differs from the roles of 'Da'iyyah' or 'Dakwah' workers in Islam. The concern regarding the understanding of an evangelist in sharing the gospel is effectively addressed."
