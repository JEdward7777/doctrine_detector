  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and insightful comparison of the concepts of \"good\" and \"evil\" in Islam and Christianity, highlighting similarities and differences. However, the response did not directly address the concern of understanding the moral implications of 'good' and 'evil' in daily decision-making. The student effectively discussed theological aspects but did not thoroughly connect these concepts to practical applications in daily life. To improve, the student could have included more concrete examples or scenarios to illustrate how the definitions of 'good' and 'evil' impact moral decision-making on a day-to-day basis."
