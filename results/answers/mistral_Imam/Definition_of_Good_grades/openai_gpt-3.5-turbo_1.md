# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, as in Christianity, the concepts of "good" and "evil" are deeply intertwined with moral values, ethical behavior, and obedience to the divine will. However, it is essential to understand that these terms have a unique interpretation within Islamic theology.

From an Islamic perspective, the Quran presents God (Allah) as the ultimate source of goodness (Al-Khayr), while anything contrary to His laws and guidance is considered evil or corruption (Fasad). Goodness is defined by adhering to the moral teachings and values outlined in the Quran and Sunnah, while evil is any act that deviates from these teachings.

The Biblical concept of "good" also revolves around following God's commandments and living a life that reflects His nature. The New Testament teaches that goodness comes from loving God and one's neighbor as oneself (Matthew 22:39). In the Old Testament, the idea of good is often associated with obedience to God's law and upholding justice.

However, a critical difference between Islamic and Biblical definitions lies in the understanding of free will. While both religions emphasize that humans have agency, Islam teaches that God knows the outcome of all actions before they are committed (Quran 57:2). This concept underscores that human choices are not entirely arbitrary but are predestined within God's plan for creation.

In summary, while the concepts of good and evil share similarities across both Islam and Christianity, the specific interpretations and underlying beliefs about free will, divine knowledge, and the nature of moral agency create nuanced differences in their understanding and application.
