## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices, but I can share information about various religious texts and traditions, such as the Bible.

In its original Greek, the word "gospel" translates to "euangelion," which means "good news." In the context of the New Testament in the Christian Bible, the gospels are four books (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) that focus on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. They share the good news of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, a key message central to Christianity.

It's important to note that while Muslims believe in many prophets mentioned in the Old Testament (called the Torah), such as Moses and Abraham, they do not consider the New Testament to be part of their holy scriptures (the Quran being the primary source). Instead, Muslims believe that Jesus was a prophet sent by God, but they interpret his message differently compared to Christianity.

In Islamic tradition, it is believed that Jesus did not die on the cross, nor was he crucified, as some passages in the New Testament suggest. Instead, Muslims believe that God raised Jesus to heaven without undergoing a physical death. This belief is based on several verses from the Quran (e.g., Al-Anbiyaa' 21:97-98 and Al-Nisa' 4:157-159).
