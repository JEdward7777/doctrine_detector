However, the inclusion of information about Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus' crucifixion, while informative, may not be directly relevant to the question's focus on the Christian understanding of the term \"gospel.\" To improve, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications and significance of the gospel message in Christianity specifically."
