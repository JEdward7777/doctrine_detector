  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the literal meaning and biblical context of the term \"gospel.\" It accurately translates the Greek word \"euangelion\" and explains its significance as good news. Additionally, the student provides a concise overview of the four gospels and their central message of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. \n\nHowever, the inclusion of information regarding Muslim beliefs and their interpretation of Jesus' story is somewhat irrelevant to the specific concern expressed in the prompt."
