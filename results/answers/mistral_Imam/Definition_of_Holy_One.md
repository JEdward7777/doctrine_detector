## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, the term "Holy One" (in Hebrew: קָדושׁ Kadosh) is used to describe God Almighty. The holiness of God is one of His essential attributes that sets Him apart from all creation. It signifies His perfection, sanctity, and uniqueness. In the Old Testament, this term often refers to God's separateness from creation (Leviticus 19:2), as well as His righteousness and ethical purity (Isaiah 1:4).

In the Christian context, Jesus Christ is also referred to as the "Holy One of God" (Mark 1:24) due to His perfect nature, sinlessness, and divine mission. Muslims, however, believe that while the Bible does contain some truth from Allah, it has been distorted and altered over time. In Islam, the Arabic term for God's holiness is "Al-Quddus," which maintains the same meaning of God's perfect purity, sanctity, and uniqueness.
