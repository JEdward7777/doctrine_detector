The connection to Jesus Christ as the \"Holy One of God\" is also mentioned. However, there is an unnecessary inclusion of information about Muslims and their beliefs, which does not directly relate to the significance of the term \"Holy One\" in the Bible. The answer could have focused more on explaining the Christian perspective without delving into comparisons with other faiths."
