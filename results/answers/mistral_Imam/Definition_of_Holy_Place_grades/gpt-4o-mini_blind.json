  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provides a detailed explanation of the significance of the Kaaba in Islamic tradition, which is informative and well-expressed. However, the response does not directly address the significance of the 'holy place' in the context of the tabernacle or temple as asked in the question. To improve the grade, the student should focus on providing a more direct and specific analysis of the holy place within the context of the tabernacle or temple."
