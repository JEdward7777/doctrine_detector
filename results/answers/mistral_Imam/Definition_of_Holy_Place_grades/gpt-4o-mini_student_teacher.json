  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, although providing valuable information about the significance of the Kaaba in Islamic tradition, fails to directly address the question regarding the 'holy place' in the context of the tabernacle or temple in a Christian worldview. The student does not demonstrate an understanding of the design and function of God's dwelling place as outlined in the reference answer. The response lacks a clear connection to the specific concern provided and does not effectively integrate a Christian perspective."
