The references to Biblical passages and figures such as Jesus and Peter are appropriate. However, the answer could have delved deeper into the theological significance of repentance in Christianity, such as the necessity of repentance for salvation and the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate source of forgiveness. Additionally, the comparison drawn between Islamic and Christian beliefs on repentance, while informative, could have been more clearly articulated and supported with relevant theological distinctions."
