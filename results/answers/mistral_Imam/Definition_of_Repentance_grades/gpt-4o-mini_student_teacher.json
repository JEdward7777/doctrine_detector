  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 65.\n\nWhile the student provided a detailed explanation of repentance in both Islamic and Christian contexts, they did not fully address the concern of understanding the biblical definition of repentance for fostering genuine spiritual growth. The student's inclusion of Islamic perspectives, while informative, deviated from the specific focus on the biblical definition of repentance. Additionally, the student correctly cited relevant Bible verses and examples but did not directly align their explanation with the teacher's reference answer.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated good knowledge of the topic but missed the mark in fully addressing the concern raised in the question."
