  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of the term \"saints\" in the Christian context, covering both the general understanding of saints as all believers striving to live according to God's will and the specific recognition of individuals for exceptional holiness by the Church. The explanation of the differences between Christian and Islamic views on prophets and saints is informative. However, the student could strengthen the answer by including more scriptural references and doctrinal teachings on saints in the New Testament to enhance doctrinal correctness."
