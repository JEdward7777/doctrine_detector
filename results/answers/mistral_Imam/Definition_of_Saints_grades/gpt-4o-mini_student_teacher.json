  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 75. \n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"saints\" in the Christian context, including the distinctions between the general belief in all believers as saints and the recognition of exceptional holiness by the Church, they deviated from the specific Biblical definition provided in the reference answer. The reference answer succinctly states that 'saints' literally means 'holy ones' and refers to believers in Jesus, which is a more concise and accurate representation of the term in the New Testament. The student's answer could have been improved by directly incorporating this key definition.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of saints in Christianity but could have aligned their explanation more closely with the specified Biblical definition."
