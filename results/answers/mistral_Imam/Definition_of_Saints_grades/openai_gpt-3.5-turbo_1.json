  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the term \"saint\" in Christianity, discussing both the general meaning of all believers being considered saints and the specific recognition of exceptional holiness by the Church. The use of Biblical references enhances the explanation and demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept. The integration of the concern regarding the importance of understanding the Biblical definition of saints is well addressed, showing a clear distinction between cultural and scriptural interpretations. Great job overall, with minor room for refinement in connecting the initial answer more explicitly to the broader discussion."
