## [Answer](../Definition_of_Saints.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian New Testament, the term "saint" has several meanings depending on the context. The most common meaning is a holy person who follows God's commandments and lives a life dedicated to Him. This is reflected in Matthew 19:20, where Jesus tells the rich young man, "If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments." In this sense, all believers are considered saints because they strive to live according to God's will.

Another meaning of saint refers to a person who has died and been recognized by the Church for their exceptional holiness and intercessory powers with God. This recognition often comes after a formal investigation, usually several years or even decades after their death, and is considered canonization in the Roman Catholic Church. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, this process is known as glorification.

It's essential to note that the concept of sainthood in Christianity differs significantly from Islamic ideas about the role of prophets and saints. While Muslims believe in many prophets mentioned in the Bible (such as Moses and Jesus), we do not attribute any intercessory powers or divinity to them, as they are considered human beings who received revelation from God.

In the Islamic context, the term "awliya'Allah" (friends of Allah) is used for those who have a special relationship with God through their strong faith, devotion, and righteous actions. However, unlike in Christianity, there is no official recognition or canonization process for awliya'Allah in Islam. Instead, the community recognizes their spiritual status based on their deeds, teachings, and impact on those around them.
