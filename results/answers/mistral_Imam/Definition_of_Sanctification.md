## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, the concept of sanctification is closely related to holiness. Sanctifying something or someone means setting them apart for a divine purpose, making them holy, pure, and dedicated to God. This process can refer to individuals (2 Corinthians 7:1) or places (Exodus 29:37), symbolizing their separation from profane use and devotion to God's service.

In the context of an individual, sanctification is a lifelong process that involves growing in spiritual maturity, conforming to Christ's image, and overcoming sin through obedience to God's commands (1 Thessalonians 4:3). This process can be initiated at the moment of salvation (2 Corinthians 5:17) but continues throughout a believer's life as they grow in their relationship with God.

In Islam, the concept of purification is somewhat similar to sanctification. Muslims strive to purify their hearts and actions through obedience to Allah (swt), following the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, and regular prayer, fasting, and other religious practices. However, the ultimate purpose in Islam is not only sanctification but also attaining closeness to God, seeking His pleasure, and entering Paradise.
