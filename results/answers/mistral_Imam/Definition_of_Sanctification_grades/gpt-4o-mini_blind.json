However, the response introduces an analogy with Islam, which could potentially confuse the reader and divert from a clear explanation of sanctification from a Christian perspective. It would have been better to focus solely on the Biblical perspective of sanctification. Additionally, the explanation could have been more detailed and referenced more scriptural passages to strengthen the explanation."
