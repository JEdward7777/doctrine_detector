  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:** \n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical definition of sanctification as setting something or someone apart for a divine purpose. They effectively connect the concept to holiness and purity, and provide examples from scripture of individuals and places being sanctified. \n\nWhile the inclusion of information regarding Islamic purification is interesting, it is not directly relevant to the Christian specific worldview and concerns the student was asked to address. This slight deviation from the prompt slightly lowers the grade. \n\nOverall, this is a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a strong grasp of the biblical concept of sanctification."
