The biblical references provided are relevant and accurate, further supporting the explanation. However, the discussion could be more comprehensive, as it only touches on the topic briefly.\n\nThe response also ventures into Islam, which is not directly related to the original concern, but does provide a useful comparison. Overall, the response shows promise in its exploration of sanctification, but could benefit from further development and attention to the specific biblical definition being sought."
