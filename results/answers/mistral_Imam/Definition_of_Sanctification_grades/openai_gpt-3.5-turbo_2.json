The student effectively incorporates relevant biblical references and demonstrates a clear understanding of sanctification as outlined in the Bible. The comparison with Islam's concept of purification adds depth to the response, showcasing a broader understanding of religious practices. The only area for improvement could be to provide more specific examples or illustrations to further enhance the explanation."
