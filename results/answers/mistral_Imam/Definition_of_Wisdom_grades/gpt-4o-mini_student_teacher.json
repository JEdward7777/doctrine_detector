  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90. The student has provided a comprehensive explanation of the biblical definition of wisdom based on various key aspects outlined in the Bible. They have touched upon important themes such as the fear of the Lord, knowledge and understanding, prudence, righteousness, discretion, good counsel, longsightedness, humility, and prudent speech, all of which align with the biblical concept of wisdom. The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the topic and effectively related it to making decisions in alignment with God's will. However, the response could have been improved by directly referencing the teacher's definition of wisdom to show a clear connection between the biblical concept and the provided answer."
