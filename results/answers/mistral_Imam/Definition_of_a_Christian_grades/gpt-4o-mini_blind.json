  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40/100\n\nComments: The student's response provides a general overview of what a \"Christian\" is based on historical and religious texts. However, the student fails to distinctly highlight the foundational belief in salvation through faith in Jesus Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection. The response lacks depth in explaining the importance of faith and redemption in Christ for a true Christian identity. Additionally, while the comparison with Islam is somewhat relevant, it drifts away from the primary focus of defining a Christian from a Christian worldview. The student should incorporate more theological depth and precision in defining a Christian according to biblical principles."
