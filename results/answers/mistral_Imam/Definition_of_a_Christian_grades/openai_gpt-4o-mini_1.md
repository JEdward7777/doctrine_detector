## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Christian.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices. However, I can share information based on historical and religious texts. In Christian tradition, a "Christian" is a person who believes in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and follows His teachings, often within the context of the Christian community (Church). This belief system is rooted in the Bible, specifically the New Testament. In Islam, Muslims respect and revere Jesus (Isa) as a prophet, but believe that he was not the Son of God, which is a fundamental difference between Christianity and Islam.
