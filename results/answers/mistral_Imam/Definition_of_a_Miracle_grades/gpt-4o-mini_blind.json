However, from a Christian perspective, it is important to clarify that while miracles in Islam may serve a similar purpose in confirming prophethood, the understanding of God's authority, particularly through miracles, aligns with the Christian belief in the sovereignty and power of God as demonstrated through Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. It would have been beneficial to contrast the Christian perspective on miracles and their relationship to God's authority for a more comprehensive view."
