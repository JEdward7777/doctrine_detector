They correctly highlighted the purpose of miracles in confirming the authenticity of prophets and reinforcing faith. However, the answer focused more on the specific context of Islam and the miracles performed by Islamic prophets, rather than providing a broader understanding of miracles in relation to God's authority from a Christian worldview. The answer could have been strengthened by incorporating more general principles of miracles and God's authority, aligning it more closely with the reference answer given."
