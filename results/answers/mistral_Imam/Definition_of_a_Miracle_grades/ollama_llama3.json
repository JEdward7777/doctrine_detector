While it does not directly address the concern about understanding God's power through miracles, it indirectly touches upon this concept by emphasizing that miracles demonstrate God's omnipotence and authority.\n\nThe response accurately defines miracles as extraordinary events that confirm the prophethood of a messenger and reinforce the validity of their message. It also effectively illustrates the role of miracles in establishing faith in the hearts of believers and encourages them to accept and follow the divine revelations.\n\nHowever, the response could have been improved by directly addressing the concern about understanding God's power through miracles. Nevertheless, it provides a clear and informative explanation of the concept of miracles in Islam, making it an acceptable response despite some minor shortcomings."
