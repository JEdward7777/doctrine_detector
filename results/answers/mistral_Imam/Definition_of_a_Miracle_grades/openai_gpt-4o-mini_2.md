## [Answer](../Definition_of_a_Miracle.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, a miracle (Kayyāmāt in Arabic) is an extraordinary event or occurrence that demonstrates the authenticity, truthfulness, and prophethood of a messenger of God. Miracles are not considered magical tricks or illusions but rather natural phenomena used by God to confirm His message through the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).

Miracles in Islam serve as evidence of God's omnipotence, proving that the Prophet is indeed speaking on behalf of God and not from his own whims or desires. The Quran mentions several miracles performed by previous Prophets such as Moses (Peace Be Upon Him) turning his staff into a snake, Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) healing the blind and the leper, and Prophet Muhammad's (Peace Be Upon Him) ability to recite the Quran without any prior education.

The miracles performed by these Prophets were not mere acts of magic or sleight-of-hand but rather clear signs from God that confirmed their prophethood and reinforced the validity of their message. These miracles helped establish faith in the hearts of their followers and demonstrated the power, wisdom, and benevolence of God.

In relation to God's authority, miracles serve as irrefutable evidence that supports His divine revelations and affirms the authenticity of the messenger who delivers them. By performing miracles, the Prophets not only demonstrated their connection with God but also encouraged the people to accept and follow the messages revealed to them by God.

In summary, a miracle is an extraordinary event or occurrence that demonstrates the prophethood of a messenger sent by God. Miracles serve as proof of God's authority, confirming the authenticity of His message and reinforcing faith in the hearts of believers.
