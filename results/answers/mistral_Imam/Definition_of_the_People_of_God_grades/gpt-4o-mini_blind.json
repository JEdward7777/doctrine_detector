However, the inclusion of Islamic beliefs in this context may cause confusion or misinterpretation when answering from a Christian-specific worldview. The response would have been stronger if it solely focused on the Old Testament understanding of the People of God without interweaving Islamic beliefs, as the two religions hold differing views on the concept."
