  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student's answer provides a generally accurate understanding of the concept of the \"People of God\" in the Old Testament and offers insights into Islamic perspectives, there are significant concerns. The student deviated from the specific concern about the covenant relationship God established with Israel in the Old Testament. The answer would have been improved if it had focused more on the unique covenant relationship between God and Israel, rather than expanding into Islamic beliefs."
