  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of \"People of God\" in the Old Testament. They accurately explain that the term primarily refers to the Israelites and provide relevant examples from the scriptures. Additionally, the student acknowledges the broader context of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. However, the inclusion of the Islamic perspective and the comparison between Islam and Christianity adds unnecessary information that is not directly relevant to the Old Testament concern."
