 In the Old Testament, the term "People of God" is primarily used to refer to the Israelites, who were chosen by God to be his special people and receive his blessings. This concept is most evident in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

The People of God were given specific laws and commandments, and they were expected to follow them as a sign of their faithfulness to God. They were also promised protection, guidance, and blessings by God, provided they remained faithful to Him.

In the Islamic context, this concept is similar yet expanded. In Islam, all believers are considered the "People of God." Muslims believe that every prophet sent by God was a part of this lineage, starting with Adam and continuing through Prophets Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Moses, Jesus, and finally, Muhammad (Peace be upon them all).

In Islam, the term "Ahl al-Kitab" or People of the Book is used to refer to Jews, Christians, and Sabians who follow God's revelations in their respective scriptures. They are considered among the People of God because they have received divine guidance. However, Muslims believe that the message brought by Prophet Muhammad supersedes all previous revelations, making Islam the final and complete religion.

In essence, being one of the "People of God" implies receiving divine guidance, following it faithfully, and recognizing the oneness and greatness of God. It is a responsibility and an honor that comes with blessings and protection from God, as long as one remains steadfast in their faith.

**Grade:** 85/100

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of "People of God" in the Old Testament. They accurately explain that the term primarily refers to the Israelites and provide relevant examples from the scriptures. Additionally, the student acknowledges the broader context of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. However, the inclusion of the Islamic perspective and the comparison between Islam and Christianity adds unnecessary information that is not directly relevant to the Old Testament concern.
