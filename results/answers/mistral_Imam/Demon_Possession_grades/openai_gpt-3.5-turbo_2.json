However, the concern regarding the need for deliverance through Jesus Christ is not addressed or emphasized in the response. From a Christian worldview, it is essential to highlight the power and authority of Jesus in delivering individuals from demonic influence. The response could have been improved by discussing the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate deliverer in spiritual warfare."
