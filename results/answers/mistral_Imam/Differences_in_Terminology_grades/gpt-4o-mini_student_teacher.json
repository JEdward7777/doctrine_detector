  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The student provided information mostly on Islamic teachings related to the terms 'exhort', 'encourage', and 'admonish', but the answer did not specifically address the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to Christian scripture. The answer also lacked the direct comparison and distinct definitions based on the Christian worldview as requested, resulting in a low grade."
