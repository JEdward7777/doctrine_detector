  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does provide some helpful information about Islamic teachings related to encouragement, it falls short in addressing the specific concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. The majority of the response is focused on providing definitions and examples of exhort, encourage, and admonish, rather than exploring how these concepts are used in a biblical context.\n\nAdditionally, the response does not provide any direct connections or applications of these Islamic concepts to Christian teachings, which was likely intended given the concern about clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture."
