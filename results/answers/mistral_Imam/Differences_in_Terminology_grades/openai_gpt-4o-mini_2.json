The connections drawn between these concepts and their Christian counterparts could have been more explicit to fully address the concern of clarifying the appropriate use of different forms of encouragement according to scripture. Additionally, highlighting similarities and differences in how these concepts are understood and applied in Christianity could have enhanced the response further."
