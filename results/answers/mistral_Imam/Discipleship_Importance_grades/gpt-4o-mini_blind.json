  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComments: The student provides a mix of information from Islamic tradition and Christianity, which may confuse the reader. The response lacks a clear focus on the Christian perspective on why the twelve apostles were chosen as Jesus' closest disciples. Additionally, there are inaccuracies in the list of apostles provided. The explanation of the significance of choosing the twelve apostles in Christianity could be more detailed and tied back specifically to Christian theology and doctrine. The response would benefit from a more concise and coherent presentation of the Christian perspective on this topic."
