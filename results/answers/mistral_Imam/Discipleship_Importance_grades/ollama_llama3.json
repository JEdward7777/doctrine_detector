  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides some good information about the apostles, including their names, relationships to each other, and the significance of their role in spreading Jesus' message. However, it does not fully address the concern of understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. The response focuses more on listing the names of the apostles and their roles, rather than providing a deeper analysis of their importance in the Christian faith.\n\nAdditionally, while the response mentions that the apostles were chosen by Jesus, it does not provide much context or explanation for why this was significant in Christianity. A higher grade would require a more detailed discussion of the apostles' role in the New Testament and its significance for understanding the Christian faith.\n\nComment: The response provides some good information about the apostles, but could benefit from a deeper analysis of their importance in the Christian faith."
