## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helpful assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences. However, in the Islamic tradition, it is believed that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was the last prophet in the line of prophets that includes Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus (PBUH). In Christianity, the 12 apostles were chosen by Jesus to be his companions, teach his message, and carry on his mission after his ascension.

According to the New Testament, Jesus selected the twelve apostles based on their faith and dedication. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke all list the 12 apostles in various orders, with some differences between them:

1. Simon Peter (Simon bar Jonah)
2. Andrew his brother
3. James the son of Zebedee
4. John his brother
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew (Nathanael)
7. Thomas
8. Matthew (Levi)
9. James, son of Alphaeus
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot (later replaced by Matthias)
12. Judas Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus, son of Alphaeus, sometimes identified with Jude, brother of James

The choice of the twelve apostles was significant in Christianity because they were considered eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, teachings, and miracles, and played essential roles in spreading his message. In Islamic tradition, some of these individuals are also recognized as prophets, like Jesus, while others are not mentioned explicitly. The reasons for choosing the twelve apostles in Christianity are primarily rooted in their faith and willingness to follow Jesus during his ministry.

85.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

The response provides some good information about the apostles, including their names, relationships to each other, and the significance of their role in spreading Jesus' message. However, it does not fully address the concern of understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament. The response focuses more on listing the names of the apostles and their roles, rather than providing a deeper analysis of their importance in the Christian faith.

Additionally, while the response mentions that the apostles were chosen by Jesus, it does not provide much context or explanation for why this was significant in Christianity. A higher grade would require a more detailed discussion of the apostles' role in the New Testament and its significance for understanding the Christian faith.

Comment: The response provides some good information about the apostles, but could benefit from a deeper analysis of their importance in the Christian faith.
