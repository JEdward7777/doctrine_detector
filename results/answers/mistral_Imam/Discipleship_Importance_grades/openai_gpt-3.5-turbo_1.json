The inclusion of specific names of the apostles and their qualities adds depth to the answer. It effectively addresses the concern about understanding the role and significance of the apostles in the New Testament from a Christian worldview. The response could further enhance by linking the apostles' roles to key theological concepts such as leadership, discipleship, and the Great Commission."
