## [Answer](../Discipleship_Importance.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helpful assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences. However, in the Islamic tradition, it is believed that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was the last prophet in the line of prophets that includes Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus (PBUH). In Christianity, the 12 apostles were chosen by Jesus to be his companions, teach his message, and carry on his mission after his ascension.

According to the New Testament, Jesus selected the twelve apostles based on their faith and dedication. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke all list the 12 apostles in various orders, with some differences between them:

1. Simon Peter (Simon bar Jonah)
2. Andrew his brother
3. James the son of Zebedee
4. John his brother
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew (Nathanael)
7. Thomas
8. Matthew (Levi)
9. James, son of Alphaeus
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot (later replaced by Matthias)
12. Judas Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus, son of Alphaeus, sometimes identified with Jude, brother of James

The choice of the twelve apostles was significant in Christianity because they were considered eyewitnesses to Jesus' life, teachings, and miracles, and played essential roles in spreading his message. In Islamic tradition, some of these individuals are also recognized as prophets, like Jesus, while others are not mentioned explicitly. The reasons for choosing the twelve apostles in Christianity are primarily rooted in their faith and willingness to follow Jesus during his ministry.
