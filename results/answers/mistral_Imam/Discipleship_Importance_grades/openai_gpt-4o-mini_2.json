The addition of the apostles' names and their individual significance adds depth to the explanation, showing a solid understanding of the topic within a Christian worldview. However, it could have benefited from a clearer connection back to the Islamic tradition mentioned at the beginning to emphasize the distinct beliefs regarding the apostles in Christianity."
