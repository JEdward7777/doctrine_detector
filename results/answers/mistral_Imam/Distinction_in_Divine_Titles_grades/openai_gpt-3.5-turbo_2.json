However, while it addresses the importance of respecting different religious beliefs, it does not directly address the concern of maintaining clarity in translations to prevent misinterpretations concerning God's identity and authority. It would have been stronger if the response explicitly tied in the significance of accurate translation to how it impacts understanding of God's identity and authority."
