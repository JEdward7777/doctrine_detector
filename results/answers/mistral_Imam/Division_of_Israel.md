## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 After the reign of King Solomon, the historical narrative shifts to a period of division between the tribes of Israel, marked by the rule of his son Rehoboam who reigned over Judah, and Jeroboam who became the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel. This event is significant in Islamic tradition as it sets the stage for many of the prophets mentioned in the Quran who were sent to the Children of Israel in Palestine, including Prophet Musa (Moses) and Prophet Isa (Jesus). It's important to note that the events following King Solomon are discussed extensively in the Bible, as well as briefly in Islamic texts. However, it is crucial to remember that the focus of Islam is on the prophetic message rather than specific historical narratives or events.
