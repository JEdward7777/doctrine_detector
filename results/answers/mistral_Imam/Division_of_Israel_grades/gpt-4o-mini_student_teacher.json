However, the mention of Islamic tradition and prophets from the Quran, while interesting, is not directly relevant to the Christian-specific worldview and understanding of the significance of the division of the Israelites. The answer would have been stronger if it had focused solely on the biblical account and its spiritual implications for the Israelites."
