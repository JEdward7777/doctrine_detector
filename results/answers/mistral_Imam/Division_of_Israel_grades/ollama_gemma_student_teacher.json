  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-written and informative response that accurately describes the major event of Israel's division following King Solomon's reign. It also demonstrates an understanding of the spiritual significance of this division from a Christian worldview by mentioning the subsequent presence of prophets like Moses and Jesus in the land. While the reference to Islamic tradition is interesting, it's not strictly necessary to answer the question from a Christian perspective."
