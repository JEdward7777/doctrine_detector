However, the answer lacks depth in exploring the spiritual significance of the division from a Christian worldview perspective. It could have delved into how the division represented a turning away from God's unity and commandments, leading to consequences for the people of Israel. An integration of Christian teachings on unity and obedience to God could have enhanced the response further."
