  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The student provides a generally accurate description of what the phrase \"do good to\" implies within a Christian context. They correctly highlight the importance of helping, supporting, and benefiting others as acts of love and compassion. The biblical references are relevant and add depth to the explanation. However, the inclusion of Quranic references may be considered unnecessary or potentially confusing within a Christian-specific explanation. To improve, the student could focus solely on Christian teachings and elaborate further on the theological significance of doing good in line with Christian doctrine."
