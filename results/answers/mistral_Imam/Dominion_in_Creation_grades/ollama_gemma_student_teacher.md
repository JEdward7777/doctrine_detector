## [Answer](../Dominion_in_Creation.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we respect all scriptures that guide humankind towards righteousness, including the Bible. The concept of humanity's role in dominion over the Earth is present in both the Islamic Quran and the Judeo-Christian Bible.

In the Bible, this idea is found in Genesis 1:26-28, where it states that God created humankind in His image and gave them authority over all other creatures on the Earth. The King James Version reads: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."

This verse suggests that humans were given a stewardship role on Earth, to take care of the planet and its creatures in a manner reflective of God's wisdom and compassion. Muslims share this understanding as we believe that Adam (peace be upon him) was tasked with tending the Garden of Eden before being sent down to Earth.

However, it is important to note that Muslims interpret certain Bible passages differently due to our belief in the Tawrat (Torah), Zabur (Psalms), and Injeel (Gospel) being divinely revealed scriptures for humankind but not existing today in their original form. In Islam, the Quran is considered the final revelation from God that corrects and confirms the teachings of previous scriptures.

In terms of contemporary environmental stewardship, Muslims are encouraged to remember the balance between being a responsible caretaker (khalifah) of the Earth while not exploiting or harming its resources without necessity. This idea is echoed in various verses in the Quran, such as: "And it is He who has appointed for you the Sabbaths (weekend rest), therefore, some of you are willing to listen and others are denying it, so ask the followers of the Reminder [the Quran] if you do not know." (Quran 65:4) This verse suggests the importance of setting aside time for contemplation, reflection, and care for nature.

**Grade: 85/100**

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical concept of humanity's dominion over the Earth and its implications for environmental stewardship. 

The student correctly cites Genesis 1:26-28 to support the idea that humans were given authority over creation and explains the stewardship role associated with this dominion. Additionally, the student acknowledges the Islamic perspective on the interpretation of certain Bible passages and highlights the importance of balance and responsible care for the Earth in Islamic tradition.

However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific responsibilities associated with dominion, particularly in the context of contemporary environmental challenges.
