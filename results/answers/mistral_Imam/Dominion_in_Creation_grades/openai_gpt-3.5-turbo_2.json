It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the shared belief in stewardship over creation as commanded by God. The inclusion of relevant scriptural references and explanations from both traditions enhances the depth of understanding. An additional connection to the concern could have been made by emphasizing the importance of exercising this authority responsibly in alignment with God's will and character as revealed in Scripture."
