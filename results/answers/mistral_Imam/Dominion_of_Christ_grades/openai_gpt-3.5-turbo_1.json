While it addresses the authority of Jesus as prophet, priest, and king in the context of Christian teachings, it does not delve deeply into how recognizing this authority impacts faith in all aspects of life. The response could further emphasize the significance of submitting to Christ's lordship and sovereignty in shaping beliefs, values, and actions as a Christian."
