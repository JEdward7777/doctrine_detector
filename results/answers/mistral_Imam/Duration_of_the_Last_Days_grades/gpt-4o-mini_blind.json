  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer from a Muslim perspective regarding the concept of the last days. While the response was informative and respectful, it lacked a Christian-specific worldview and did not directly address the question in relation to the Bible. Encouraging the student to incorporate insights from a Christian perspective would have enhanced the answer's relevance to the original query."
