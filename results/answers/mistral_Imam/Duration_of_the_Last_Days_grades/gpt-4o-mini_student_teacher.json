  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student provided information from a Muslim perspective when the question specifically asked for a Christian viewpoint. Additionally, the student did not address the concern raised about how uncertainty regarding the duration of 'the last days' can impact how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ\u2019s return. The answer did not align with a Christian worldview and failed to directly address the question and concern provided."
