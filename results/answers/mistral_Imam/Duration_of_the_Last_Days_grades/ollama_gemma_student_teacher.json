  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a thorough and well-researched response that addresses the concern of Christians anticipating Christ's return. They clearly explain that the specific duration of the \"last days\" is not explicitly stated in the Bible or Islamic texts. The student offers insights from both Islamic perspectives and scholarly interpretations, discussing signs that may precede the end times. While the response is well-written and informative, it does not directly address the Christian worldview or the specific concern related to Christian anticipation of Christ's return."
