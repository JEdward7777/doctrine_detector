## [Answer](../Duration_of_the_Last_Days.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, I can share information based on various religious texts and scholarly interpretations. In this case, let's discuss the concept from a Muslim perspective since you mentioned a Muslim Imam.

In Islam, there isn't a specific timeline given for the 'last days' or "the Day of Judgment" (Yawm al-Qiyamah) in the same way as the Bible describes the end times. The Quran mentions signs that will precede the last day, but it does not specify exact dates or a duration for these events. This is to emphasize that human beings cannot determine the specific timing of such events.

However, many scholars interpret certain events mentioned in Hadith (the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad) and Quran as potential indications of the approach of the last days. Some common signs include increased global conflicts, widespread corruption, and the spread of knowledge and technology to remote places, among others. It is important to note that these interpretations can vary among scholars and Muslim communities, and there is ongoing debate about their significance and interpretation.

In essence, Muslims are reminded to be prepared spiritually for the Day of Judgment at all times rather than focusing on attempts to predict specific timelines or events. As the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary descends among you as a just judge." (Sahih Muslim 2967).

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 75/100**

**Comment:** The student provides a thorough and well-researched response that addresses the concern of Christians anticipating Christ's return. They clearly explain that the specific duration of the "last days" is not explicitly stated in the Bible or Islamic texts. The student offers insights from both Islamic perspectives and scholarly interpretations, discussing signs that may precede the end times. While the response is well-written and informative, it does not directly address the Christian worldview or the specific concern related to Christian anticipation of Christ's return.
