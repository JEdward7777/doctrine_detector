It accurately conveys the uncertainty surrounding the timing of these events in Islam. However, from a Christian worldview, the concern is that the lack of specificity in the Islamic narrative regarding the end times may lead to a different approach in living out one's faith compared to the urgency and readiness emphasized in Christianity in anticipation of Christ's return. This perspective could have been further emphasized in the response."
