However, the concern raised regarding how this uncertainty may affect how Christians live out their faith in anticipation of Christ\u2019s return is not directly addressed. From a Christian worldview, it is essential to highlight the importance of being vigilant, steadfast, and ready at all times for Christ's return, regardless of the unknown duration of the last days. This aspect could have been emphasized more clearly in the response."
