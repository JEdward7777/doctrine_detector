They have covered various aspects such as guidance, spiritual gifts, empowerment for ministry, sanctification, comfort and peace, and the fruit of the Spirit. The inclusion of a comparison with Islamic teachings adds depth to the response. However, the answer could be improved by tying the listed ways of empowerment more closely to the concern of the importance of awareness of the Holy Spirit's empowerment for effective ministry and living out one's faith."
