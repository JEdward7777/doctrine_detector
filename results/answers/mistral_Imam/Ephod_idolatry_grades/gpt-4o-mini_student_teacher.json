  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and detailed analysis of the story of Gideon and the golden Ephod, drawing insightful parallels to the dangers of deviating from God's path. However, the student's focus on caution in religious innovation from a Muslim perspective detracts from the Christian-specific worldview required in this grading scenario. The answer should have emphasized the importance of focusing on God and avoiding idolatry within a Christian context."
