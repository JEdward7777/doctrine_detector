  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response effectively summarizes the lesson from Gideon's story, highlighting the dangers of creating objects associated with worship that can lead to idolatry. The example from Judges 8:27 is well-explained, and the connection to the concern about focusing on God rather than material representations of faith is clear.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly linked the story of Gideon's golden ephod to the broader theme of avoiding distractions from true worship. While this connection is hinted at in the concluding sentence, it could be more explicitly stated throughout the response. Nevertheless, the response does an excellent job of illustrating the importance of maintaining proper perspective and focus on God.\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the biblical text and its application to the concern about focusing on God. The writer effectively conveys the lesson from Gideon's story and provides relevant examples to support their argument. With some refinement to explicitly link the story to the broader theme, this response could be even stronger."
