They thoroughly explained the materials used and the design elements, showcasing an understanding of the significance and symbolism of the ephod in worship. The only minor deduction is that the response could have been more concise and focused directly on the specific materials used, as emphasized in the concern provided. Overall, a well-researched and insightful answer."
