What materials were used in the construction of the high priest's ephod?

The high priest's ephod was specially embroidered with gold, blue, purple, and red yarn.

Knowing the specific materials highlights the importance of the ephod's design and symbolism in worship.

## [Answer](../Ephod_materials.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic context, as we don't have any direct texts or references regarding the construction of the High Priest's ephod, it is more appropriate to refer to the accounts from the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). According to Exodus 28:6-15 and following verses, the ephod was made using specific materials.

The ephod consisted of two main parts: the breastpiece and the ephod itself. The breastpiece had twelve gemstones set in four rows, with the Urim and Thummim (two sacred objects used for divination) inside it. The gemstones were likely carnelian, chrysolite, emerald, topaz, turquoise, sapphire, beryl, onyx, jasper, agate, amethyst, and lapis lazuli.

The ephod itself was made of linen and wool. It had two shoulder pieces connected by a band of the same material. Gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarns were also used for embroidery, as well as precious stones and engraved settings for these stones. The design included pomegranates, bells, and cherubim.

Please note that this answer is based on the descriptions found in the Hebrew Bible, which may not directly apply to Islamic traditions or beliefs.
