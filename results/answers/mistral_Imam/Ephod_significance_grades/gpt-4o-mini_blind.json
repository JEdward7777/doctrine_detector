  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provides a solid overview of the significance of the High Priest's Ephod in Old Testament worship, highlighting key elements such as the breastpiece with the tribes of Israel, the Urim and Thummim, and the robe with bells and pomegranates. The explanation of how the Ephod symbolized God's guidance, protection, and constant presence among the Israelites is well articulated. The student could further enhance their answer by delving deeper into the theological symbolism behind each component of the Ephod and its broader implications in connecting the High Priest with God and the people."
