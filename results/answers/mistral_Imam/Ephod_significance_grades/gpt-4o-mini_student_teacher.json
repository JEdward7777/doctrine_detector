  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and accurate explanation of the significance of the High Priest's Ephod in the context of Old Testament worship. They correctly highlighted the communication between God and His people, emphasized the role of the breastpiece with the Urim and Thummim, and connected it to divine guidance and presence. However, the student could enhance their answer by focusing more on the specific aspect of mediation between God and the people through the high priest's role, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, a solid understanding and explanation of the topic."
