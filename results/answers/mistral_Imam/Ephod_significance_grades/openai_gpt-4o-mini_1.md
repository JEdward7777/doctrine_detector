## [Answer](../Ephod_significance.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Old Testament, the High Priest's Ephod was a sacred garment worn by the Aaronide High Priest during his service in the Tabernacle (later, the Temple) of Jerusalem. The Ephod played a crucial role in maintaining communication between God and His people, Israel.

The Ephod consisted of two main parts: the breastpiece and the robe or coat. The breastpiece was made up of 12 precious stones, engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel, and connected by a cord to Urim and Thummim (two sacred objects used for divination). The High Priest would wear this breastpiece over his heart, symbolizing God's guidance and protection for both the High Priest and the people.

The robe or coat was woven from fine linen and had golden bells and pomegranates attached to its hem. This aspect of the Ephod was meant to remind the people that God was always with them, even when they went about their daily activities (Exodus 28:36-37).

In summary, the High Priest's Ephod signified the connection between God and His chosen people, Israel. It represented divine guidance, protection, and constant presence of God among the Israelites during Old Testament worship.
