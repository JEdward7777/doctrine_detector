  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the concept of \"perishing\" in Islamic belief, discussing the consequences of rejecting Allah's message and the potential punishments in the afterlife. However, the student did not directly address the seriousness of eternal separation from God, which was the specified concern. The student's answer focused more on describing Islamic beliefs rather than emphasizing the gravity of being separated from God for eternity."
