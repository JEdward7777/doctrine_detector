  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the Islamic perspective on the eternal consequences for those who are described as \"perishing.\" The response accurately explains the Islamic belief in accountability for actions in the afterlife and the punishment of separation from Allah. Additionally, the student provides relevant references from Islamic scriptures and teachings. However, the response would benefit from further elaboration on the specific nature of the punishment in hell and the concept of redemption or reconciliation with God."
