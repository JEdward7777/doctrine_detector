## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the Oneness of God (Tawhid), which includes belief in His transcendence and uniqueness. In Islam, we do not acknowledge any being as the "Son of God," because such a belief would imply partnership with God in His Divinity, which is fundamentally against our faith.

In terms of existence and eternal nature, it's important to note that the concept of "Son" as understood in Christianity does not apply to human sons or any other created beings. The Son of God in Christian doctrine is understood as a divine being co-equal with God the Father, which contradicts the Islamic belief in the absolute oneness and uniqueness of God (Allah).

In contrast, human sons are created beings, they have a beginning and an end. They are not eternal or self-existent like Allah who is Eternal and Self-Existent (As-Samad) according to Islam. In summary, the 'Son of God' in Christian context refers to Jesus Christ, but in Islam we believe that Jesus was a prophet (or messenger) of Allah, not His Son in any way that would imply co-eternality or partnership in Divinity.
