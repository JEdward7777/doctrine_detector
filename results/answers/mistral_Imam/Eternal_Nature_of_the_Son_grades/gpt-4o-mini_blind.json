However, from a Christian worldview, the explanation falls short in addressing the specific Christian understanding of the Son of God as part of the Holy Trinity and the eternal nature of the Son. It would be beneficial to include more depth on the Christian theological perspective to provide a more comprehensive comparison between the two faiths."
