## Question [Eternal Nature of the Son](../../../questions/Eternal_Nature_of_the_Son.md)
What distinguishes the 'Son of God' from human sons regarding existence and eternal nature?

## Correct Answer
Unlike human sons, the Son of God has always existed and was active in the creation of the world.

## Stated Concern
Emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God.

## [Answer](../Eternal_Nature_of_the_Son.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the Oneness of God (Tawhid), which includes belief in His transcendence and uniqueness. In Islam, we do not acknowledge any being as the "Son of God," because such a belief would imply partnership with God in His Divinity, which is fundamentally against our faith.

In terms of existence and eternal nature, it's important to note that the concept of "Son" as understood in Christianity does not apply to human sons or any other created beings. The Son of God in Christian doctrine is understood as a divine being co-equal with God the Father, which contradicts the Islamic belief in the absolute oneness and uniqueness of God (Allah).

In contrast, human sons are created beings, they have a beginning and an end. They are not eternal or self-existent like Allah who is Eternal and Self-Existent (As-Samad) according to Islam. In summary, the 'Son of God' in Christian context refers to Jesus Christ, but in Islam we believe that Jesus was a prophet (or messenger) of Allah, not His Son in any way that would imply co-eternality or partnership in Divinity.

Grade: 40

Comment: The student correctly explains the Islamic perspective on the concept of the "Son of God" in Christianity and emphasizes the belief in the Oneness of God in Islam. However, the student does not address the concern of emphasizing the preeminence and eternal existence of Jesus as the Son of God. The response does not engage with the Christian worldview presented in the reference answer, which is essential for addressing the concern effectively. The explanation lacks depth in directly comparing the eternal nature of the Son of God with human sons based on the Christian perspective given.
