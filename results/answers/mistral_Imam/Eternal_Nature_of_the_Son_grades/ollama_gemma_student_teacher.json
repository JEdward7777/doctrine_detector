  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theological differences between Christianity and Islam regarding the nature and existence of the Son of God. They clearly articulate the Islamic belief in the oneness of God and reject the Christian concept of the Son as co-equal with God the Father. The student's explanation of the difference between human sons and the Son of God is well-reasoned and consistent with Islamic theology. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the specific differences between the Son of God and human sons in terms of their eternal nature."
