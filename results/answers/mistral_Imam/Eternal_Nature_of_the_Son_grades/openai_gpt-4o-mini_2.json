However, from a Christian perspective, the response falls short in emphasizing the significance of Jesus as the eternal Son of God who played an active role in the creation of the world. In Christian theology, Jesus is not just a prophet or messenger of God but rather the second person of the Trinity who is co-equal and co-eternal with God the Father. As such, the response does not fully address the concern of emphasizing Jesus' preeminence and eternal existence as the Son of God."
