  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The answer provided presents a perspective from Islamic theology regarding the concept of eternal punishment in Hell. While it is insightful to understand different beliefs, the response deviates significantly from a Christian worldview, which was requested for grading. It is important for the response to align with Christian doctrine when discussing theological concepts such as God's justice and eternal punishment in Hell. Encourage the student to focus on providing responses that adhere to the specific worldview requested for the assignment."
