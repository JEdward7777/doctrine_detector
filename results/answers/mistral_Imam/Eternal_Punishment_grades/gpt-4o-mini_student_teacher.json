  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written and thoughtful response from an Islamic perspective regarding the concept of eternal punishment in Hell. However, the concern specified a Christian-specific worldview, and the student did not address this adequately. The response focused on Islamic beliefs about God's justice and mercy, accountability for actions, and the opportunity for redemption through repentance. While these points are valuable from an Islamic standpoint, they do not align with the Christian perspective mentioned in the provided answer. The student should have specifically discussed how the concept of eternal punishment in Hell reflects God's justice within the framework of Christianity."
