  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response earns a high score because it effectively addresses the concern about divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences, while also providing a clear Islamic perspective on the nature of Hellfire. The writer skillfully explains that Islam teaches that God's justice is rooted in accountability for individual actions, rather than predetermination, and that repentance is always available. The response also highlights the importance of living virtuous lives and striving towards achieving eternal paradise.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly address the concern about Jesus' sacrifice or the concept of Hell as punishment for rejecting His salvation plan, which is the main focus of the given answer. To achieve a higher score, the writer could have integrated these elements more explicitly into their explanation, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the Christian perspective on divine justice and mercy."
