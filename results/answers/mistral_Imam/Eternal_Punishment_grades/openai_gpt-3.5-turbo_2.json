  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on eternal punishment in Hell. It effectively addresses the concern about the nature of divine justice and mercy in relation to eternal consequences, emphasizing the importance of accountability, free will, and the opportunity for repentance in Islam. However, since the answer provided was specifically from a Christian perspective, the grade is slightly lower as the focus should have been on Christian beliefs rather than Islamic ones."
