  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective but did not address the given biblical reference adequately. The student mentioned the interpretation of Matthew 19:12 but did not directly relate it to the concept of celibacy as requested. Additionally, the response lacked depth in discussing the biblical perspective on celibacy and did not thoroughly explore the reasons for choosing a life without marriage in Christianity. More focus on connecting the biblical reference to the concept of celibacy would have improved the grade."
