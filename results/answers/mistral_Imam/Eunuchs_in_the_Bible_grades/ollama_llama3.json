  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of providing background information on Islamic perspectives on celibacy and comparing it to Christian views. It also acknowledges that there can be different reasons for living a life without marriage, which aligns with the concern about understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy.\n\nHowever, the response could have done more to focus specifically on the biblical passage (Matthew 19:12) and Jesus's words in relation to celibacy. While it does mention Jesus's statement, it doesn't delve deeper into its meaning or significance within Christian theology.\n\nThe response also uses a Muslim scholar's perspective as a starting point, which is relevant but not directly addressing the concern about understanding the biblical perspective on celibacy. A more explicit connection between the Islamic and Christian perspectives would have strengthened the response.\n\nOverall, the response provides valuable insights into the differences between Islamic and Christian views on celibacy, but could benefit from further exploration of Jesus's words in Matthew 19:12 and its implications for understanding biblical perspectives on celibacy."
