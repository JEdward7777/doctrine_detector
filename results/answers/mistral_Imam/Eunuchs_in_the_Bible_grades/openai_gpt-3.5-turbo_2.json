The student effectively addresses the concern by discussing the interpretation of Matthew 19:12 in Christian theology and contrasting it with Islamic teachings on marriage and celibacy. The response could be improved by providing more specific references to relevant Islamic and Christian scripture to support the arguments made. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the theological implications of celibacy within each faith tradition would have enhanced the analysis."
