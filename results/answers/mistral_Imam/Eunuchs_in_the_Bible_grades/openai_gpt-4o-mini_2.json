  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively engages with the biblical perspective on celibacy based on the given answer and concern. It provides a clear comparison between the Christian view on celibacy as understood from the Bible and the Islamic perspective on marriage. The explanation of Jesus's words in Matthew 19:12 and their interpretation in Christian theology is well articulated, along with the Islamic view on celibacy for those who choose a life of seclusion or are unable to marry. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concept of celibacy and effectively explores the different reasons for choosing a life without marriage in both Christianity and Islam."
