  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides a comprehensive explanation of exalting God in daily life from an Islamic perspective, the concern specified a Christian worldview. The response heavily emphasizes Islamic beliefs, practices, and concepts such as Tawheed, Zakat, Ramadan, Hajj, and the spread of Islam. \n\nIn a Christian perspective, exalting God in daily life primarily involves praising and honoring Him through worship, prayer, and aligning one's actions with God's will. The student's answer does not directly address this Christian-specific understanding of exalting God.\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of the importance of faith and devotion, but it falls short of addressing the Christian worldview perspective outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
