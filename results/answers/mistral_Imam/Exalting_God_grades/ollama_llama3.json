  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of what it means to exalt God (Al-Ikhlaas) in daily life, citing various Islamic teachings and practices such as Tawheed Ar-Ruboobiyyah and Al-Uluhiyyah, performing the five daily prayers, giving Zakat, fasting during Ramadan, making Hajj, adhering to Islamic ethics and morals, expressing gratitude and love for Allah SWT, seeking knowledge and understanding of Islam, maintaining a high level of consciousness and mindfulness, practicing humility and submission before Allah SWT, upholding Islamic values and principles, and avoiding Shirk (polytheism).\n\nThe response also effectively addresses the concern of understanding the importance of exalting God above all else in life by highlighting the various ways in which one can demonstrate their devotion to Allah SWT, including through worship, prayer, and living according to His will.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could be even more explicit in its emphasis on the importance of exalting God as the primary concern in life. While it does touch on this theme, it could be further developed throughout the response. Overall, however, this is a strong and well-organized response that effectively addresses the topic and concern."
