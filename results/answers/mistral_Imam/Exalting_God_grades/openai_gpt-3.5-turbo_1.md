 Exalting God (Al-Ikhlaas) in our daily life is a fundamental aspect of Islam that involves expressing the purest form of faith, devotion, and submission to Allah SWT. This can be achieved through several ways:

1. Tawheed Ar-Ruboobiyyah: Believing and declaring that Allah SWT is the sole Creator, Sustainer, and Controller of all things in existence, with no partner or associate.

2. Tawheed Al-Uluhiyyah: Believing and declaring that Allah SWT alone deserves our love, respect, obedience, and worship, without any intermediaries or idols.

3. Acting upon the teachings of Islam in our daily life: This includes performing the five daily prayers, giving Zakat (charity), fasting during Ramadan, making Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) if able, and adhering to Islamic ethics and morals in our dealings with others.

4. Expressing gratitude and love for Allah SWT: Regularly acknowledging the blessings bestowed upon us by Allah SWT and expressing gratitude through prayers, thankful actions, and good deeds.

5. Seeking knowledge and understanding of Islam: Continuously learning about Islamic teachings, striving to implement them in our life, and sharing this knowledge with others to spread the message of Islam.

6. Maintaining a high level of consciousness and mindfulness: Constantly remembering Allah SWT throughout our day and reflecting upon His signs and attributes in creation.

7. Practicing humility and submission before Allah SWT: Acknowledging our weaknesses, limitations, and dependence on Allah SWT, and seeking His guidance and help in all matters.

8. Upholding Islamic values and principles: Striving to live by the ethical principles and moral values prescribed by Islam, such as honesty, compassion, fairness, and justice.

9. Avoiding Shirk (polytheism): Refraining from associating partners with Allah SWT in worship or attributing divinity to anyone or anything other than Him.

By striving to fulfill these aspects of exalting God in our daily life, we can draw closer to Allah SWT and experience the peace, contentment, and happiness that comes from living a life guided by the teachings of Islam.
