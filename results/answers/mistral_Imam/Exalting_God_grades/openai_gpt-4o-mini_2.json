It covers various aspects of exalting God in daily life, such as acknowledging the oneness of Allah, practicing Islamic rituals, expressing gratitude, seeking knowledge, and upholding ethical values. The response effectively addresses the concern by illustrating how exalting God above all else leads to drawing closer to Allah and experiencing peace and happiness.
