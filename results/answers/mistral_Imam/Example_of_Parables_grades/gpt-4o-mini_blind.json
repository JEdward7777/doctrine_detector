It would benefit from a clearer emphasis on the importance of the different types of soil representing the state of one's heart towards receiving and responding to the Word of God. The explanation could have delved deeper into the spiritual implications of the parable in terms of faith, discipleship, and bearing fruit for the Kingdom of God. Additionally, the response could have highlighted Jesus' own interpretation of the parable, as found in the Gospels, to provide a more comprehensive understanding."
