  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the Parable of the Sower and its significance in both Christianity and Islam. While the student's analysis is insightful, the focus on the Parable of the Sower does not directly align with the provided reference answer of the Good Samaritan. However, the student effectively discussed the moral lessons embedded in the parable and its relevance today from a broader religious perspective. The student's answer shows a good understanding of the parable's teachings, with clear efforts to apply its lessons to contemporary relevance."
