  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and detailed response citing specific instances of demon possession from the Bible. They connected these examples to the significance of Jesus' power over evil spirits. However, the student could have further emphasized the prevalence of spiritual issues in the Biblical narrative and their relevance to contemporary faith, focusing more on the deeper spiritual implications and lessons that can be drawn from these accounts in relation to personal faith and spiritual warfare."
