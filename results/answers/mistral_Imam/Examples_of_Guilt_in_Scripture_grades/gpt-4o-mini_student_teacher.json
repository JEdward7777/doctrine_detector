  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70. While the student provided relevant examples from the Bible that demonstrate the concept of guilt and repentance, the response did not explicitly tie these examples back to the concern provided, emphasizing the need for divine judgment. Additionally, the response did not engage deeply with the Christian worldview on guilt and justice. The examples given are appropriate, but a stronger connection to the concern and a clearer incorporation of Christian perspectives on guilt would have improved the answer."
