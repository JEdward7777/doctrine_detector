 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, I can help you find examples in the Bible that might shed light on your question regarding guilt. Here are some instances:

1. Adam and Eve's Expulsion from Eden (Genesis 3): After eating the forbidden fruit, Adam and Eve became aware of their nakedness and felt guilty. This is demonstrated by Adam hiding from God and Eve making excuses when confronted.

2. Cain and Abel (Genesis 4): When Cain killed his brother Abel out of jealousy, he felt guilt and was afraid when God asked him about Abel's whereabouts. God then cursed Cain because of his sin.

3. King David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11-12): King David committed adultery with Bathsheba and had her husband Uriah killed to cover up his crime. Prophet Nathan confronted David about his actions, revealing his guilt and causing him to repent.

4. Jonah and Nineveh (Book of Jonah): God commanded Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh to repent from their wicked ways because God planned to destroy them. When the people of Nineveh heard this message, they fasted, prayed, and turned away from their evil deeds, demonstrating their guilt and desire for redemption.

5. Peter's Denial (Matthew 26:69-75): After Jesus predicted that Peter would deny Him three times before the rooster crowed, this came to pass when Peter denied knowing Jesus during His trial. Peter felt deep regret and guilt after his actions.

These examples illustrate feelings of guilt, repentance, and the consequences of one's actions in the Bible. It is essential to learn from these stories and apply their lessons to our lives in our unique religious contexts.
