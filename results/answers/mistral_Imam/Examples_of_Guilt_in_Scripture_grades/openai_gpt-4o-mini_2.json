  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a strong analysis of Biblical examples that demonstrate guilt in the context of justice and innocence. The inclusion of examples such as Pilate declaring Jesus innocent and the robber acknowledging guilt compared to Jesus aligns well with the concern provided. The explanation is thorough and effectively illustrates the need for divine judgment in understanding guilt. Overall, this response effectively incorporates a Christian worldview in addressing the concern at hand."
