  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided information from Islamic tradition regarding Jesus and presented it respectfully, the answer did not directly address the question about specific miracles performed by Jesus and their significance within a Christian worldview. In the context of grading from a Christian perspective, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness by not including the well-known miracles performed by Jesus as recorded in the Bible, such as turning water into wine, healing the sick, raising the dead, and walking on water. Additionally, the focus on Islamic beliefs about Jesus, while informative, strays from the requirements of the question. The response could be improved by directly addressing the Christian view of Jesus' miracles and their significance."
