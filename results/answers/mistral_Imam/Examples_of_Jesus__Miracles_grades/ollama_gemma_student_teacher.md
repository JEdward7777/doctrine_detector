## [Answer](../Examples_of_Jesus__Miracles.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a student of Islamic studies, I would like to clarify that in Islam, we believe in the prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him) and his role as a messenger of God, but not in the Christian concept of his divinity or the performance of miracles in the way they are understood in Christianity. However, some traditions among Muslims suggest certain extraordinary events associated with Jesus (peace be upon him), which I will share below:

1. Annunciation (Ayat al-Kursi):
The Quran mentions that Allah (God) spoke directly to Maryam (Mary), the mother of Jesus, and informed her about the conception of Jesus without a father (Quran 3:45-47). This is considered a miracle because it was beyond human understanding and was a divine intervention in nature.

2. The Birth of Maryam's Son without a Father:
The virgin birth of Jesus is mentioned in the Quran as a sign of his purity, uniqueness, and miraculous nature (Quran 19:20-35). Although it is not referred to as a "miracle" in the same way Christians understand it, it is seen as evidence that Jesus was chosen by God and protected from ordinary human circumstances.

3. The Creation of Clay Birds:
One hadith (saying or action) attributed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) narrates that when Jesus was a child, he made birds out of clay and breathed life into them (Muslim 2317). This story is used to highlight Jesus' extraordinary powers as a prophet and his close relationship with God.

4. The Miraculous Journey:
According to some accounts, after Jesus was accused unjustly, he was taken by Allah (God) to a distant place without being harmed or traveling physically (Quran 3:51). This story emphasizes Jesus' innocence and the extraordinary intervention of God to protect him.
