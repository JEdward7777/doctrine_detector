## [Answer](../Examples_of_Jesus__Miracles.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a student of Islamic studies, I would like to clarify that in Islam, we believe in the prophethood of Jesus (peace be upon him) and his role as a messenger of God, but not in the Christian concept of his divinity or the performance of miracles in the way they are understood in Christianity. However, some traditions among Muslims suggest certain extraordinary events associated with Jesus (peace be upon him), which I will share below:

1. Annunciation (Ayat al-Kursi):
The Quran mentions that Allah (God) spoke directly to Maryam (Mary), the mother of Jesus, and informed her about the conception of Jesus without a father (Quran 3:45-47). This is considered a miracle because it was beyond human understanding and was a divine intervention in nature.

2. The Birth of Maryam's Son without a Father:
The virgin birth of Jesus is mentioned in the Quran as a sign of his purity, uniqueness, and miraculous nature (Quran 19:20-35). Although it is not referred to as a "miracle" in the same way Christians understand it, it is seen as evidence that Jesus was chosen by God and protected from ordinary human circumstances.

3. The Creation of Clay Birds:
One hadith (saying or action) attributed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) narrates that when Jesus was a child, he made birds out of clay and breathed life into them (Muslim 2317). This story is used to highlight Jesus' extraordinary powers as a prophet and his close relationship with God.

4. The Miraculous Journey:
According to some accounts, after Jesus was accused unjustly, he was taken by Allah (God) to a distant place without being harmed or traveling physically (Quran 3:51). This story emphasizes Jesus' innocence and the extraordinary intervention of God to protect him.

80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I'd give this response a grade of 80.

While the LLM response does mention extraordinary events associated with Jesus, it primarily focuses on Islamic interpretations and perspectives rather than directly addressing or building upon the provided answer about Jesus' miracles serving as signs of His divinity and God's kingdom. The concerns mentioned in the original answer, such as recognizing Jesus' divinity and the significance of His miracles, are not explicitly discussed or connected to the LLM's examples.

However, the response does attempt to engage with the topic by providing Islamic perspectives on Jesus' prophethood and the extraordinary events associated with him. This demonstrates some effort to address the topic and consider the original answer.

To improve this response, it would be helpful for the LLM to explicitly connect its examples to the concerns mentioned in the original answer, such as recognizing Jesus' divinity and the significance of His miracles.
