However, from a Christian worldview, the response falls short in addressing the concern of recognizing Jesus' miracles as signs of His divinity and as crucial aspects of believing in Him as the Son of God. The response focuses solely on the Islamic perspective without directly addressing the significance of Jesus' miracles in confirming His divinity and unique relationship with God as central to Christian belief."
