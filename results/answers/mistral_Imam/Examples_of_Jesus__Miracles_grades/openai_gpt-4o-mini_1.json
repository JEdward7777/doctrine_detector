However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to recognize that Jesus' miracles, such as calming storms, healing the blind, and raising the dead, are not just signs of his divinity, but central to affirming Him as the Son of God. While the response accurately presents the Islamic perspective, it does not address the concern regarding the significance of Jesus' miracles in understanding His divinity as the Son of God in Christianity."
