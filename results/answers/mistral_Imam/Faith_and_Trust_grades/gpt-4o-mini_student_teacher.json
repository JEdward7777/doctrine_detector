  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and thoughtful answer that effectively explains the relationship between trust and faith in the Christian context. The response aligns with Christian beliefs by emphasizing the importance of trust in God's promises and character within the framework of faith. However, the student could improve by directly linking the concept of trust to faith in a more concise and explicit manner, as demonstrated in the reference answer."
