## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic context, Muslims believe in Jesus (Prophet Isa) as one of the most significant prophets sent by Allah (God) to guide humanity. According to Islamic teachings, Prophet Isa was born miraculously to the Virgin Mary (Maryam) and had no father. He performed many miracles, such as healing the sick and bringing the dead back to life, which were signs of his prophethood.

However, Muslim beliefs about Jesus differ from those in some Christian traditions. Muslims do not believe that Jesus was divine or the son of God. Instead, they regard him as a human messenger who received revelation from Allah. Islamic texts, including the Quran and hadiths, describe Jesus' crucifixion as a substitution, with another man being crucified in his place. Muslims believe that Jesus did not die on the cross but was raised to heaven (ascended) alive and will return one day to judge humanity and establish justice.

In conclusion, to "believe in Jesus" as a Muslim means acknowledging him as a prophet of Allah, recognizing his miraculous birth, and accepting his teachings and signs as guidance for humanity. Muslims do not believe that he is divine or the son of God.
