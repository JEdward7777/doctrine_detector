  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while informative about the Islamic perspective on Jesus (Prophet Isa), does not address the Christian understanding of \"believing in Jesus\" as described in the text. The key components of trusting Jesus as the Son of God and recognizing his sacrifice for sins are missing in the response. It is essential to focus on the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life, which the student did not adequately address in their answer."
