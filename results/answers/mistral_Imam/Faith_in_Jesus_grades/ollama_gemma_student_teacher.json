  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the Islamic perspective on the belief in Jesus. However, it does not address the Christian specific concern of understanding the implications of faith and trust in Jesus for personal life. The answer lacks any reference to personal transformation, salvation, or a relationship with Jesus as the Son of God."
