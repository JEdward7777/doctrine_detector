The response lacks a Christian-specific perspective on how true faith in Jesus manifests in a person's life according to biblical principles. It is important for the student to focus on the Christian understanding of Jesus and how faith in Him impacts one's beliefs, actions, and relationship with God in a Christian worldview."
