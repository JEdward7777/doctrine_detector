  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the relationship between true faith in Jesus and its manifestation in a person's life within the context of Islam. However, it does not directly address the concern of recognizing genuine faith in daily life as specified in the grading criteria. While the response highlights Islamic beliefs and practices related to Jesus, it lacks specific examples or evidence of how these beliefs translate into daily actions or behaviors that demonstrate genuine faith."
