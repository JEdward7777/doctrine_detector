The response focused on describing Islamic beliefs and practices related to Jesus, but did not directly engage with the concept of good spiritual fruits or behaviors as a result of true faith in Jesus. The Christian worldview emphasizes that true faith in Jesus should manifest in transformed lives marked by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control, as evidence of the presence and work of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the response could have been more explicit in drawing a connection between faith in Jesus and its impact on daily behavior from a Christian perspective."
