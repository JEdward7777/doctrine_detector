While it outlines the Muslim beliefs about Jesus and how true faith in Jesus manifests in Islam, it does not specifically address how this faith produces good spiritual fruits or behaviors due to the Holy Spirit living in the individual. In a Christian worldview, authentic faith in Jesus is expected to bear fruit in a believer's life, showcasing virtues such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control as evidence of the presence of the Holy Spirit. The response could have been enhanced by exploring how these spiritual fruits are seen in the lives of those who truly believe in Jesus."
