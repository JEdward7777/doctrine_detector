  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides detailed insights into the Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and how Muslims demonstrate their faith in him. However, the given answer and concern focus on the idea that true faith in Jesus will produce good spiritual fruits or behaviors due to the Holy Spirit within the individual. While the response outlines Muslim beliefs and practices related to Jesus, it does not directly address the Christian-specific concern of recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life. Therefore, the grade is lower as the response does not align closely with the specified concern."
