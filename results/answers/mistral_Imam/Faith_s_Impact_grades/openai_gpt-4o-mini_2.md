## [Answer](../Faith_s_Impact.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, Muslims believe that Jesus (Isa) is one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity, and that he was not a mere mortal but a noble messenger with miraculous qualities. True faith in Jesus as a Muslim manifests in several ways:

1. Recognition of his Prophethood (Rasul): Muslims believe in the prophethood of Jesus, acknowledging that he was sent by Allah to guide and teach humanity, just like other prophets mentioned in the Quran such as Muhammad (peace be upon them).

2. Acceptance of his Miracles: Muslims acknowledge the miracles performed by Jesus during his lifetime, such as healing the sick and giving life to the dead, as a sign of Allah's power working through him.

3. Compliance with his Teachings: As a prophet of Allah, Muslims believe that Jesus taught pure morals and ethical behavior. Muslims strive to follow his example in terms of compassion, kindness, honesty, and humility.

4. Rejection of his Divinity: Muslims do not believe that Jesus was divine or the son of God, as this concept contradicts the oneness of Allah (Tawhid). Instead, Muslims believe that he is a servant of Allah, like all other prophets, and that he worshipped Allah just as we are obligated to do.

5. Hope in his Second Coming: Muslims believe in the second coming of Jesus at the end of times (Day of Judgment), when he will descend to earth to restore justice and defeat the Anti-Christ (Dajjal). This belief is a source of hope for Muslims, who look forward to his return as a sign that Allah's promise will be fulfilled.

6. Prayers for Jesus: Muslims offer prayers for all prophets, including Jesus, as a sign of respect and devotion. These prayers are an expression of their faith in the guidance and blessings these prophets bring to humanity.

Grade: 65

Comment: The response provides detailed insights into the Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and how Muslims demonstrate their faith in him. However, the given answer and concern focus on the idea that true faith in Jesus will produce good spiritual fruits or behaviors due to the Holy Spirit within the individual. While the response outlines Muslim beliefs and practices related to Jesus, it does not directly address the Christian-specific concern of recognizing the evidence of genuine faith in daily life. Therefore, the grade is lower as the response does not align closely with the specified concern.
