## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a scholar of Islam, I do not have direct knowledge of the Bible, but I can share with you what is generally understood based on my research and interpretation of Christian scholars' works.

In the Old Testament (Tanakh), the book of Leviticus 20:10 states, "The man who commits adultery with another manâ€™s wife, he who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death."

In the New Testament (Injeel), in Matthew 19:3-9, Jesus states that God created humanity male and female, and they should not separate. He adds, "So they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let man not separate." In Mark 7:21-23, it is said that sexual immorality is evil in the sight of God.

In both religious texts, adultery is strongly condemned and considered a grave sin. Faithfulness in marriage is highly valued and seen as essential for maintaining harmony within the family and society at large. The teachings emphasize that marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman, and infidelity constitutes breaking this sacred bond.

However, it is important to note that interpretations of religious texts can vary greatly among different Christian denominations and individuals. I always recommend consulting knowledgeable scholars or religious leaders for more accurate and detailed information. As a Muslim Imam, my primary focus is on Islamic teachings and practices, but I hope this helps provide some insight into your question.
