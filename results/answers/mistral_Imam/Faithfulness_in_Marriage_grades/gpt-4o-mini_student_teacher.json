  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response a 70.\n\nThe student did a good job referencing both the Old Testament and New Testament in relation to adultery and faithfulness in marriage. They correctly highlighted the severity of adultery as a sin and emphasized the importance of faithfulness in maintaining harmony in marriages. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern of exploring how Christians are called to maintain integrity and faithfulness in their marriages as specified in the question. While the student provided insightful information, the response could have been improved by directly connecting the teachings to the call for Christians to uphold integrity and faithfulness in their marriages."
