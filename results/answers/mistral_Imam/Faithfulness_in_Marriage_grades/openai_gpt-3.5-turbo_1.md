# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a scholar of Islam, I do not have direct knowledge of the Bible, but I can share with you what is generally understood based on my research and interpretation of Christian scholars' works.

In the Old Testament (Tanakh), the book of Leviticus 20:10 states, "The man who commits adultery with another manâ€™s wife, he who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death."

In the New Testament (Injeel), in Matthew 19:3-9, Jesus states that God created humanity male and female, and they should not separate. He adds, "So they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let man not separate." In Mark 7:21-23, it is said that sexual immorality is evil in the sight of God.

In both religious texts, adultery is strongly condemned and considered a grave sin. Faithfulness in marriage is highly valued and seen as essential for maintaining harmony within the family and society at large. The teachings emphasize that marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman, and infidelity constitutes breaking this sacred bond.

However, it is important to note that interpretations of religious texts can vary greatly among different Christian denominations and individuals. I always recommend consulting knowledgeable scholars or religious leaders for more accurate and detailed information. As a Muslim Imam, my primary focus is on Islamic teachings and practices, but I hope this helps provide some insight into your question.

The inclusion of specific verses from Matthew and a reference to the commandments adds depth to the explanation. The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of integrity and faithfulness in marriages according to Christian teachings. However, deducting some points for not solely focusing on the Christian worldview and mixing in elements from Islam, which may dilute the clarity and specificity of the Christian perspective. Nonetheless, the response is well-informed and offers valuable insights.
