  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as a 75. \n\nWhile the student demonstrated a good understanding of how faithfulness to God is expressed in both the Islamic and Biblical contexts, there are theological differences between Christianity and Islam that should be acknowledged in this type of comparison. The student could have highlighted the Christian belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and the significance of salvation through Him, which are central to the Christian understanding of faithfulness to God. Additionally, the student could have discussed the importance of grace and faith in Christianity as opposed to the emphasis on works in Islam. Overall, the student provided a well-written comparison, but it would have been stronger with a deeper exploration of the distinct theological differences between the two faiths."
