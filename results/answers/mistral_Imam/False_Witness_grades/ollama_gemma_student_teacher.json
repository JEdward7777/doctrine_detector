  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical perspective on giving false testimony and highlights the significance of truthfulness in both Christian and Islamic contexts. The inclusion of relevant scripture references and interpretations adds depth and authority to the response. However, the lack of personal reflection or application of the concept to a Christian worldview slightly detracts from the overall grade."
