It effectively addresses the concern by reflecting on family roles and spiritual responsibilities within the context of both faith traditions. The mention of key teachings from both Islam and Christianity adds depth to the analysis. The response could be enhanced by further exploring the specific roles and responsibilities associated with the birthright in Christianity and how they relate to stewardship and inheritance in a family context."
