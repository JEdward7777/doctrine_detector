From a Christian worldview, it is important to recognize that the Fruits of the Holy Spirit specifically refer to love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23), which are qualities Christians are called to manifest through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The discussion did not connect the identified virtues in Islam to the specific Fruits of the Holy Spirit in Christianity, which is crucial for understanding spiritual growth in a Christ-like manner."
