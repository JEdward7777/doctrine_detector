While the response does not directly address the concern regarding reflecting Christ-like character, it effectively demonstrates how similar virtues in Islam can contribute to spiritual growth and moral development. It could have been strengthened by directly addressing the concern raised from a Christian perspective and contrasting it with the Islamic viewpoint."
