## [Answer](../Fulfilling_Promises.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian perspective, fulfilling promises or vows made before God is of paramount importance as it demonstrates faithfulness and obedience towards Him. The Bible states in Matthew 5:37, "Just say a yes, yes, and a no, no! Anything more comes from the evil one." This suggests that Christians are expected to keep their word and honor their commitments.

In the Old Testament, making vows before God was a serious matter and breaking them was considered a sin (Numbers 30:2). Jesus also emphasized the importance of keeping promises in His teachings (Matthew 5:17-20).

The New Testament continues this emphasis on faithfulness. James 5:12 advises, "But above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear—not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. All you need to say is a simple yes or no; otherwise you will be liable to judgement."

In summary, fulfilling promises or vows made before God is highly valued in the Christian perspective as it reflects one's commitment to God and integrity towards others.
