They clearly explain that fulfillment involves an event or circumstance predicted by the prophet occurring exactly as foretold. The inclusion of the example of the virgin birth of Jesus Christ highlights the literal fulfillment of prophecies in Scripture. \n\nHowever, the student's response could benefit from further elaboration on the relationship between God's sovereignty and prophecy fulfillment. Additionally, their acknowledgment of differing interpretations of prophecies between Christian and Islamic traditions adds nuance to the discussion."
