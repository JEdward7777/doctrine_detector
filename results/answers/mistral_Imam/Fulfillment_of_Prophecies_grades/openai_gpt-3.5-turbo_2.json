The example of the prophecy regarding the virgin birth of Jesus from Isaiah 7:14 is appropriately used to illustrate this concept. The reference to different interpretations and beliefs in Islamic teachings shows awareness of diverse viewpoints. However, more direct reference to how God interacts with prophecy and its realization in Scripture would further enhance the understanding from a Christian worldview perspective."
