  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student has provided an excellent explanation of the significance of fulfilled prophecies in the Christian faith, particularly in relation to Jesus Christ as the Messiah. The answer gives strong examples and connects them well to the belief in Jesus' divinity. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention how fulfilled prophecies also demonstrate God's sovereignty and faithfulness, as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
