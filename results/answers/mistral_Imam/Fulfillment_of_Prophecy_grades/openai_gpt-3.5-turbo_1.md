# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian faith, fulfilled prophecies play a significant role as evidence of the divine nature and messiahship of Jesus Christ. The Old Testament (Tanakh) contains many prophecies about a future Messiah, including his lineage, birthplace, manner of death, and resurrection. According to the New Testament, many of these prophecies have been fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

For instance, Isaiah 9:6-7 prophesies the coming of a child who will be called "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace." Matthew 1:23 cites this passage as fulfilled in Jesus, stating that his name was to be called Emmanuel, which means "God with us."

Similarly, Psalm 22 and Isaiah 53 describe in detail the suffering and crucifixion of the Messiah. Many Christians believe these prophecies are fulfilled in the Passion of Jesus Christ.

The significance of fulfilled prophecies lies in the argument that they provide strong evidence for the divinity of Jesus, as only a divine being could fulfill such detailed and specific predictions made hundreds of years prior to his birth. This is one of the reasons why Christians believe Jesus is not just a prophet but the promised Messiah and Son of God.
