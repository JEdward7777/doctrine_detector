  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response that explores the concept of the soul from both Islamic and biblical perspectives. However, the student did not directly address the specific concern provided about acknowledging the figurative language surrounding 'soul' for a deeper understanding from a biblical perspective. Additionally, the student's response focused more on the general teachings of Islam and Christianity regarding the soul rather than delving into the figurative uses of the word 'soul' in the Bible. To improve the grade, the student should focus on specifically addressing the concern raised and relate it to the biblical concept of the soul using the provided reference answer."
