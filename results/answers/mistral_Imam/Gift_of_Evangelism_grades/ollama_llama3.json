  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 40.\n\nThe response does not directly address the concern about understanding spiritual gifts related to evangelism and their role in the church. While it provides some general information about evangelists and their role, it does not specifically discuss spiritual gifts or how they relate to evangelism.\n\nAdditionally, while the response does provide some relevant context from an Islamic perspective, it is not directly addressing the concern or providing a clear understanding of spiritual gifts related to evangelism.\n\nTo improve this response, I would suggest that the assistant explicitly address the concern by discussing the different types of spiritual gifts that can be used for evangelism, and how these gifts are utilized within the church."
