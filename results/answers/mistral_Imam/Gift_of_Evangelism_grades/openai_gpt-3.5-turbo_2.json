  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the concept of evangelists as Christians with a special spiritual gift for sharing the gospel. It addresses the concern of understanding spiritual gifts related to evangelism within the church. The grading is slightly reduced due to not explicitly incorporating a Christian-specific worldview in the explanation. A clearer connection to Christian beliefs or scripture would further enhance the response from a Christian perspective."
