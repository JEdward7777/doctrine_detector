  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 85.\n\nWhile the student provided a comprehensive list of actions that believers can take to actively glorify God in their daily lives, the emphasis on specific Islamic practices and beliefs may be a concern from a Christian worldview. It is important to note that Christians do not share the same beliefs and practices as Muslims, and therefore focusing on Islamic rituals and teachings may not align entirely with a Christian perspective on glorifying God. \n\nThe reference answer from the teacher emphasizes sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments, which is more in line with a Christian worldview. It would be beneficial for the student to include more explicitly Christian practices and beliefs in their response in order to fully address the concern provided."
