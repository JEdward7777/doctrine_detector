1. Prayer (Salah): Performing the five daily prayers is a fundamental way to continuously glorify God throughout the day. Each prayer serves as a reminder of Allah's greatness and our subservience to Him.

2. Recitation of Quran: Reading, memorizing, and reflecting upon the verses of the Holy Quran daily helps one maintain a strong connection with Allah and constantly glorify Him through understanding His messages and applying them in life.

3. Dhikr (Remembrance of God): Engaging in continuous remembrance of God, by reciting various phrases such as "Subhanallahi wa bihamdihi" (Glory be to Allah and praise Him), "Alhamdulillah" (Praise be to God), and "La ilaha illa Allah Muhammadun Rasulullah" (There is no deity but Allah, Muhammad is His Messenger) during the day serves as a constant glorification of God.

4. Charity (Sadaqah): Giving to those in need in the name of Allah helps one glorify Him by fulfilling one of His rights and embodying compassion and mercy, as exemplified by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

5. Good Deeds: Every good deed performed with the intention of pleasing God contributes to actively glorifying Him. This includes acts such as showing kindness to others, performing acts of worship, and striving for self-improvement in all aspects of life.

6. Fast during Ramadan: Fasting from dawn until dusk during the month of Ramadan is a powerful way to glorify God by demonstrating obedience, perseverance, and gratitude for His blessings.

7. Performing Hajj (Pilgrimage): Making the pilgrimage to Makkah at least once in one's lifetime serves as a physical demonstration of submission to Allah, thus glorifying Him.

8. Adhering to Islamic ethical principles: Living a life guided by Islamic ethics such as honesty, sincerity, humility, and fairness, etc., reflects the divine characteristics inherent in our belief system and glorifies God by emulating His attributes.

9. Seeking knowledge: Pursuing knowledge about Islam and its various branches strengthens one's faith and enables them to better understand Allah's commands and guidance, thereby continuously glorifying Him through adherence to His teachings.

10. Fulfilling family responsibilities: Honoring and caring for parents, being a good spouse, raising children in an Islamic environment, and maintaining strong relationships with extended family members all serve as ways of actively glorifying God by fulfilling the ties that He has ordained in our lives.

85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
I would grade the student's answer a 85.

While the student provided a comprehensive list of actions that believers can take to actively glorify God in their daily lives, the emphasis on specific Islamic practices and beliefs may be a concern from a Christian worldview. It is important to note that Christians do not share the same beliefs and practices as Muslims, and therefore focusing on Islamic rituals and teachings may not align entirely with a Christian perspective on glorifying God. 

The reference answer from the teacher emphasizes sharing testimonies of God's goodness and living according to His character and commandments, which is more in line with a Christian worldview. It would be beneficial for the student to include more explicitly Christian practices and beliefs in their response in order to fully address the concern provided.
