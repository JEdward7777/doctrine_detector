# Question [God's Revelation](../../../questions/God's_Revelation.md)
How does God introduce Himself using His name in the Bible?

God often uses His name 'Yahweh' instead of pronouns when speaking about Himself, which reveals His identity and the covenant relationship He has with His people.

# Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of His revelation in understanding God's character and relationship with His followers.

# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, God introduces Himself to Moses in Exodus 3:14 using the name "Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh," often translated as "I Am That I Am" or "I Am Who I Am." This name emphasizes God's eternal and self-existent nature. It is an important name that highlights God's independence and sovereignty, reinforcing His unique status as the one true God.

In Islamic tradition, Muslims believe in the same God mentioned throughout the Bible. In Arabic, Muslims know God by the name "Allah" (the Arabic word for God). The meaning of Allah encompasses the qualities of the One and Only deity who is self-sustaining, omniscient, omnipotent, merciful, just, and compassionate. In the Quran, Allah introduces Himself in various verses, emphasizing His attributes and unique position as the Creator, Sustainer, and Judge of all that exists.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of how God uses His name 'Yahweh' to reveal His identity and covenant relationship with His people in the Bible. However, the response does not fully address the concern raised about the importance of recognizing God's revelation in understanding His character and relationship with His followers. More emphasis on this aspect, especially in comparison to the Islamic tradition mentioned, would have strengthened the response.
