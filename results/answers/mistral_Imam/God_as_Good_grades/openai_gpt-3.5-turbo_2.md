## [Answer](../God_as_Good.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim Imam, I would like to clarify that the question you asked originates from a non-Muslim religious context, specifically from the Gospel of Mark 10:18. However, it is important to note that Muslims revere Jesus (peace be upon him) as a prophet and messenger of God, just as we do with other prophets like Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all).

In the context you provided, Jesus was responding to a man who asked him what he should do to inherit eternal life. In this context, Jesus was affirming the absolute goodness of God, not making any claim about his own nature or character. The belief in God's absolute goodness is a fundamental principle in Islam as well, and we believe that only God (Allah) is perfect and free from all imperfections.

It is essential to remember that while there may be similarities between Islamic teachings and those found in other religious texts, the context and interpretation of these teachings can vary significantly. In Islam, we emphasize the unity and oneness of God (Tawhid), which includes recognizing His absolute goodness, power, and wisdom. We also believe that all prophets conveyed the same message, monotheism, and called people to worship and serve only one God.

I hope this helps to clarify Jesus' statement in its original context and provides insight into how Muslims understand and interpret religious teachings.
