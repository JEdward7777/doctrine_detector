  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-written explanation from an Islamic perspective regarding the concept of a remnant. However, in the context of grading with a Christian worldview, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness as it does not align with Christian beliefs about God's selective grace towards His people. The answer also does not directly address the Christian understanding of a remnant and how it indicates God's selective grace. Therefore, the grade is lower as the response does not meet the criteria of providing a Christian-specific worldview perspective on the topic."
