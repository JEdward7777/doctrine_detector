However, the answer does not align closely enough with the Christian-specific worldview in addressing the concern given. The response focuses on Allah's selective grace towards individuals in Islam, rather than God's selective grace towards His people as understood in Christianity. The answer lacks direct references to the Christian understanding of God's chosen people and His covenant with them. Greater emphasis on how the remnant concept applies within a Christian framework would have improved the response."
