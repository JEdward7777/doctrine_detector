## [Answer](../God_s_Chosen_People.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic perspective, the concept of a remnant (Khulafa' al-Thaqalain or Ahl al-Kisa) refers to the close companions of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) and his family members, who are considered as the most blessed and honored individuals by Allah (God). The idea of a remnant indicates Allah's selective grace towards His people by bestowing upon them special knowledge, blessings, and guidance.

This selective grace is not a sign of favoritism but rather a manifestation of Allah's wisdom and mercy. As the Quran states in Surah Al-Imran (3:164), "And remember We took from the Prophets their covenant and from you (O Muhammad) and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary; We took from them a solemn covenant." This verse indicates that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was included among the chosen individuals who were granted special grace by Allah.

The remnant serves as a model for Muslims to emulate, demonstrating the correct application of faith and the Sunnah (Prophetic traditions) in their daily lives. By studying the examples set by these individuals, Muslims can draw closer to Allah and attain His pleasure. In this sense, the idea of a remnant indicates that selective grace is not only a historical phenomenon but also a practical guide for modern-day Muslims seeking spiritual growth and guidance.
