  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive and thoughtful explanation of the concept of being \"called by one's name\" in Islam and how it reflects our relationship with Allah. The response effectively explores the implications of identity and belonging to God in a Muslim's life. However, the student could enhance their answer by directly addressing the Christian perspective and how this concept aligns or differs with Christian beliefs. Additionally, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the personal relationship aspect emphasized in the Christian worldview."
