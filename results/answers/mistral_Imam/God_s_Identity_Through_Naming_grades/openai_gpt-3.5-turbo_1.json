It effectively illustrates the significance of this concept within the Islamic faith. However, to fully address the concern from a Christian perspective, it would have been beneficial to incorporate more explicit references to the Christian beliefs on belonging to God, redemption through Christ, and the identity of believers as children of God. Connecting these aspects would have strengthened the comparison between the two worldviews."
