## [Answer](../God_s_Identity_Through_Naming.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, the notion of being "called by one's name" is deeply symbolic and reflects a profound understanding of our relationship with God (Allah). This concept is rooted in the Quran where Allah addresses His creations using their names or attributes.

When Allah calls us by our names, it signifies that He knows each individual intimately - more than we know ourselves. It emphasizes His omniscience and intimate awareness of every detail about us, from our thoughts to our actions. This knowledge extends beyond our physical existence, encompassing the essence of our souls and the intentions behind our deeds.

At the same time, being called by our names also indicates a personal relationship between God and His creation. When Allah addresses us using our names, it implies that we are not just generic entities but unique individuals with specific roles and destinies within His grand scheme. It signifies that He has an individual plan for each of us and is mindful of our specific circumstances, trials, and triumphs.

This divine acknowledgment also serves as a reminder of our accountability before Allah. As Allah knows us by name, we are accountable for every action and thought in accordance with the Quranic verse: "Call upon me; I will respond to you" (Quran 40:60). This means that we must strive to live up to our individual potentials as guided by the teachings of Islam, seeking Allah's pleasure through good deeds and righteous intentions.

Overall, being called by one's name in an Islamic context highlights the intimate, personal nature of our relationship with God, emphasizing His omniscience, awareness, individualized guidance, and our accountability in response to His call. This sacred bond serves as a foundation for spiritual growth and piety in Muslim life.
