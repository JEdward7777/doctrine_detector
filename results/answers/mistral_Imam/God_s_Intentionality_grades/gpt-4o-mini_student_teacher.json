  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-supported explanation of the significance of God's \"Call\" in Islamic theology, emphasizing intentionality and purpose. The response effectively draws on key Islamic beliefs and practices to support their points. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern of intentional nature of God's interaction with humanity as stated in the reference answer. The student's response could have been more focused on how God's intentional invitation through His call plays a central role in guiding individuals towards fulfilling their specific roles in His divine plan."
