It effectively addresses the concern by showing how God's call is intentional and purposeful, inviting individuals to fulfill specific roles in His divine plan. The explanation is thorough, well-supported with relevant Islamic beliefs and references, and demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective."
