It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how God's call in Islam is deliberate and purposeful. The inclusion of specific Islamic concepts and references from the Quran demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective. The response is clear, coherent, and enriches the understanding of the significance of God's call in Islam. A very well done response!"
