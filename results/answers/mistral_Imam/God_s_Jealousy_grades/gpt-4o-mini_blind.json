However, the inclusion of Islamic teachings and the comparison with Allah's Oneness introduces a theological syncretism that may potentially blur the distinct understandings of God in Christianity and Islam. It would have been more appropriate to focus solely on the Christian perspective and the biblical context of God's jealousy. Additionally, more emphasis on God's righteous jealousy for His own glory and the purity of the relationship with His people could have been beneficial for a more comprehensive understanding."
