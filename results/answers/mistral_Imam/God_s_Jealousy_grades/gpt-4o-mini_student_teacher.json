  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a good explanation of God's jealousy in the context of the Bible, emphasizing its unique nature compared to human jealousy. However, the student's inclusion of Islamic teachings, while informative, detracts from the Christian specific worldview required in this context. The student could have focused more on the significance of God's jealousy in relation to His character and His desire for spiritual fidelity from His covenant people based on the given concern."
