## [Answer](../God_s_Jealousy.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, when God is described as "jealous," it doesn't carry the same connotation as human jealousy. Rather, it reflects God's intense passion for His relationship with humanity, particularly the Israelites in the context of the Old Testament.

The Hebrew word used here, "qanas," has a broader meaning that encompasses zeal and fervor, but also includes the idea of being intensely protective or possessive, especially over something valued greatly. In this sense, God's jealousy is His deep longing for exclusive devotion from His creation.

It is important to note that this concept aligns with Islamic teachings about the Oneness (Tawheed) and Uniqueness of Allah, emphasizing that He alone should be worshipped and that all acts of worship should be directed towards Him. This is a fundamental principle in both the Bible and the Quran.

In summary, when God is described as 'jealous' in the Bible, it speaks to His profound love for a relationship with humanity and an intense desire for exclusivity in devotion, much like how Muslims understand Allah's Oneness (Tawheed).
