## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic theology, God's justice is not comparable to human justice. God's mercy and compassion surpass our understanding, and He has the power to forgive and absolve sins in a way that we cannot comprehend fully. This concept is beautifully expressed in the Quran: "And it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know." (2:216)

Justification, in Islamic terminology, is often referred to as 'Istighfar' (seeking forgiveness) or 'Tawafuw' (forgiveness). When a person sincerely repents and seeks God's forgiveness for their sins, God, out of His infinite mercy, may forgive them. This process of seeking forgiveness and being granted it is a continuous and ongoing journey for every Muslim, as the Quran states, "Say: 'O my servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah: verily Allah forgives all sins; for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.'" (39:53)

The key aspects of this process are sincerity in repentance, understanding and accepting that God's forgiveness is a gift, and striving to avoid repeating the sin. It is important to note that while God is just, He is also compassionate and merciful. He does not want His servants to live in a state of constant guilt or despair but rather encourages them to seek His forgiveness and turn towards Him in repentance.

In conclusion, justification in an Islamic context entails seeking and being granted God's forgiveness for one's sins through sincere repentance and striving to avoid repeating the sin. It is a reminder of God's infinite mercy and compassion for His creation.
