  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: \nWhile the answer provides a detailed explanation of how Muslims seek forgiveness for their sins and the concept of justification in Islamic theology, it fails to address the Christian perspective as requested in the question. The explanation lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian worldview, which is essential for grading this question. The grade reflects the omission of the Christian perspective on God's justification of sinners."
