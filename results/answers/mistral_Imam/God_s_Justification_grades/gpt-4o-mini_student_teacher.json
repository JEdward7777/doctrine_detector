  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while insightful about the Islamic perspective on seeking forgiveness, does not address the Christian doctrine of justification through Jesus Christ. The importance of repentance and God's mercy in Islam is noted, but the key concept of God justifying sinners through faith in Jesus and the righteousness imputed to believers is missing. The student should have focused on the specific Christian understanding of justification and its crucial role in salvation."
