While it is informative and well-written from an Islamic standpoint, it does not directly address the Christian doctrine of justification through faith in Jesus for salvation. To fully address the concern of clarifying the Christian view of justification and its importance in salvation, the focus should have been on the unique role of Jesus as the means through which believers are justified before God, emphasizing the substitutionary atonement and the imputed righteousness extended through faith in Christ."
