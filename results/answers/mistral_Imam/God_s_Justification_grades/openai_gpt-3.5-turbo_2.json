  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of justification in an Islamic context, emphasizing seeking forgiveness and God's mercy. However, the grade is low as the focus needed to be on clarifying the Christian doctrine of justification through faith in Jesus Christ for salvation, which was not adequately addressed. The response did not align with the specified concern regarding the importance of justification in Christian salvation. More emphasis on Jesus as the means of justification would have been necessary for a higher grade."
