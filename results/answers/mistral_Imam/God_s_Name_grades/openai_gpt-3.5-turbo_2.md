## [Answer](../God_s_Name.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices. However, I can provide information based on religious texts and scholarly work. In Islam, we believe that the name "Yahweh" is one of the names of God (Allah) from a Jewish and Christian context.

The significance of this name in Judaism and Christianity is deeply rooted in their traditions. The name Yahweh is thought to reflect God's self-revelation to Moses at the burning bush, as recorded in the book of Exodus (3:14). It is often translated as "I am who I am," or "I will be who I will be."

In Islam, we recognize that Allah has 99 beautiful names, each with its own unique attributes and significance. While Yahweh is not one of the 99 names mentioned in the Quran, it is regarded as a name of God used by our monotheistic brethren in Judaism and Christianity.

It's important to note that in Islamic tradition, we believe that all the prophets, including Moses, acknowledged the oneness of God (Tawhid) and called upon Him using names that are recognized within their respective communities. Therefore, while Yahweh is not a name used commonly among Muslims, it holds significant spiritual value for our fellow monotheists.
