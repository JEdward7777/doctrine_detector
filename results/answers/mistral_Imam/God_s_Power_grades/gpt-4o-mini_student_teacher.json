  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 60.\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the term \"Almighty\" within Islamic belief, the answer did not address the Christian specific worldview in relation to the question. From a Christian perspective, the focus would be on God's omnipotence, emphasizing His all-powerful nature and complete authority over everything. The response lacked the specifically Christian understanding of God's omnipotence, which is fundamental in faith and worship according to the given concern."
