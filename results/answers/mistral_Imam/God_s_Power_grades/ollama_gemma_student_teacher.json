It accurately explains that the term signifies Allah's supreme power, omnipotence, and control over all aspects of creation. The student also correctly highlights the significance of this attribute in Islamic faith and worship, emphasizing Allah's sovereignty and majesty. \n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a clearer connection to the provided concern about understanding God's omnipotence being fundamental to faith and worship. Additionally, the answer focuses primarily on Islamic belief, while the question does not specify a particular religion. Including a brief acknowledgement of other faith traditions' perspectives on the concept of omnipotence would enhance the overall breadth of the response."
