It highlights the significance of this attribute in understanding God's sovereignty, power, and capability in a clear and coherent manner. The response aligns well with the concern that understanding God's omnipotence is fundamental to faith and worship, as it emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's absolute control and authority over all aspects of His creation."
