  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student shared a thoughtful comparison between the Christian Bible and the Quran regarding the concept of divine promises, they missed the specificity of how God's promises are viewed within the Christian faith. The answer lacked a direct reference to the Christian belief in God's promises and their significance in the relationship with His people as outlined in the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student also did not address the concern directly, which was to emphasize how understanding God's promises helps believers trust His faithfulness in their own lives. Overall, the response provided valuable insights but missed the mark in connecting the concept of God's promises to the Christian worldview."
