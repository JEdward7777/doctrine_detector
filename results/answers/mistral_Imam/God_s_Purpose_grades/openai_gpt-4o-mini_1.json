While the guidance is rooted in Islamic teachings, the response does not directly address the specific concern raised regarding believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling, leading to spiritual uncertainty. Integrating this concern and providing a more tailored reassurance within the Islamic framework would enhance the response."
