  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provided valuable insights from an Islamic perspective on discerning God's plan, emphasizing seeking knowledge, relying on faith, praying regularly, reflecting on signs of God, and seeking counsel from others. While these points are relevant and important in Islam, the response did not directly address the specific concern regarding believers feeling lost or confused about their purpose or calling, leading to spiritual uncertainty. To improve the grade, it would be beneficial to include how Islamic teachings specifically address spiritual uncertainty and provide comfort and guidance in such situations."
