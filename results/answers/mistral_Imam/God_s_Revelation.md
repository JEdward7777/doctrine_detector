## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, God introduces Himself to Moses in Exodus 3:14 using the name "Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh," often translated as "I Am That I Am" or "I Am Who I Am." This name emphasizes God's eternal and self-existent nature. It is an important name that highlights God's independence and sovereignty, reinforcing His unique status as the one true God.

In Islamic tradition, Muslims believe in the same God mentioned throughout the Bible. In Arabic, Muslims know God by the name "Allah" (the Arabic word for God). The meaning of Allah encompasses the qualities of the One and Only deity who is self-sustaining, omniscient, omnipotent, merciful, just, and compassionate. In the Quran, Allah introduces Himself in various verses, emphasizing His attributes and unique position as the Creator, Sustainer, and Judge of all that exists.
