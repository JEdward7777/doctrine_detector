  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student accurately explains how God introduces Himself using His name in the Bible as \"Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh\" in Exodus 3:14, emphasizing God's eternal and self-existent nature. However, the inclusion of information about Islamic tradition and the name \"Allah\" is slightly off-topic and not directly relevant to the question asked, which lowers the grade. It would have been better to focus solely on the biblical perspective of God's introduction using His name."
