The additional information provided about God's name 'Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh' and its portrayal of His eternal and self-existent nature aligns well with the Christian worldview. The concern is adequately addressed by highlighting the importance of recognizing God's revelation in understanding His character and relationship with His followers within the biblical context."
