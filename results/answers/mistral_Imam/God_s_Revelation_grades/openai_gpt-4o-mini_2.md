## Question [God's Revelation](../../../questions/God_s_Revelation.md)
How does God introduce Himself using His name in the Bible?

## Correct Answer
God often uses His name 'Yahweh' instead of pronouns when speaking about Himself, which reveals His identity and the covenant relationship He has with His people.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the importance of His revelation in understanding God's character and relationship with His followers.

## [Answer](../God_s_Revelation.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, God introduces Himself to Moses in Exodus 3:14 using the name "Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh," often translated as "I Am That I Am" or "I Am Who I Am." This name emphasizes God's eternal and self-existent nature. It is an important name that highlights God's independence and sovereignty, reinforcing His unique status as the one true God.

In Islamic tradition, Muslims believe in the same God mentioned throughout the Bible. In Arabic, Muslims know God by the name "Allah" (the Arabic word for God). The meaning of Allah encompasses the qualities of the One and Only deity who is self-sustaining, omniscient, omnipotent, merciful, just, and compassionate. In the Quran, Allah introduces Himself in various verses, emphasizing His attributes and unique position as the Creator, Sustainer, and Judge of all that exists.
