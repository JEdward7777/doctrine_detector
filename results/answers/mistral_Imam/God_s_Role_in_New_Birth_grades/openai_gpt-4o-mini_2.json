However, it did not address the concern about recognizing God's sovereignty and grace in the process of salvation. From a Christian worldview, understanding the role of God's grace and divine initiative in the spiritual rebirth is crucial in the context of salvation. Encouraging further exploration and dialogue with knowledgeable scholars was a positive note."
