They highlighted key aspects such as trust, patience, gratitude, humility, hope, peace, purposeful living, and mindfulness, which align well with the concept. While the response was thorough and well-reasoned, it could have been further strengthened by directly connecting these points to the specific concern provided and focusing more on the relationship between God's timing and our expectations in life. Additionally, reinforcing the central idea that trusting in God's timing and sovereignty is fundamental to enhancing faith would have been beneficial."
