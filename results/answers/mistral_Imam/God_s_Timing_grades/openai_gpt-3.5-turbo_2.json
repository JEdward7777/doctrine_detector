It expands on the concept of 'appointed time' by discussing trust, patience, gratitude, humility, hope, peace, purposeful living, and mindfulness, all of which are key aspects of how believers can align their expectations with God's timing and sovereignty. The response effectively addresses the concern raised and offers a well-rounded perspective grounded in Islamic teachings."
