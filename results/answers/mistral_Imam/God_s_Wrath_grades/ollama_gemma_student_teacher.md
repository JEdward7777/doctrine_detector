## [Answer](../God_s_Wrath.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, we do not refer to the "Day of Yahweh," as Yahweh is considered the name of God in Judaism and Christianity, not Islam. Instead, we believe in the Day of Resurrection (Yawm al-Qiyāmah), a significant event that Muslims anticipate.

Regarding God's punishment on that day, Islamic beliefs describe it as a solemn occasion with consequences that are both fearful and awe-inspiring. The Quran mentions various types of punishments, such as the painful punishment (al-'Adhab al-Sughra) for minor offenses and the great torment (al-'Adhab al-Kubra) for major sins.

The Quran describes some aspects of this day:

1. Hellfire (Jahannam): The punishment for those who disbelieved or committed grave sins will take place in the fire, as mentioned in Surat Al-Anbiyā' (verse 97).

2. Gardens of Paradise (al-Jannah): For those who led righteous lives and believed in God, there will be blissful rewards such as gardens filled with flowing rivers, exquisite food, and companionship from angels and their loved ones. This is described in Surat Al-Baqarah (verses 25 and following).

3. Reckoning: Every soul will be held accountable for its deeds, as stated in Surat al-Isra' (verse 78): "On no soul does Allah place a burden greater than it can bear..."

4. Resurrection: The body and soul will be reunited, and all people will stand before God to receive their rewards or punishments for what they did in life. This is described in Surat al-Qiyamah (verses 1-5).

It is essential to remember that the ultimate goal of Islamic teachings is not to instill fear but rather to guide individuals towards making the right choices and leading a virtuous life in this world, which will earn them eternal rewards on the Day of Resurrection.
