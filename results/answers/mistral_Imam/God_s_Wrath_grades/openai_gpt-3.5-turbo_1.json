  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding the Day of Resurrection and the consequences of God's punishment for disbelief. It accurately conveys the Islamic perspective on judgment and consequences, addressing the concern raised. However, the focus is on Islamic tradition rather than Christian beliefs. To improve the grade, the response could have drawn more explicitly on Christian teachings to contrast and engage with the provided answer."
