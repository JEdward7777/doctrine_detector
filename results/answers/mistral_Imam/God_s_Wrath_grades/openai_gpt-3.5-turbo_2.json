  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of Islamic beliefs regarding the Day of Resurrection and God's punishment for disbelief. It addresses the concern by describing the consequences for disbelief in terms of the punishment in Hellfire and the rewards in Paradise. However, the specific phrase \"pouring out of God\u2019s wrath\" is not directly addressed in the response, which slightly reduces the grade. Overall, the explanation is thorough and aligns well with Islamic teachings on judgment and consequences for disbelief from a Christian worldview perspective."
