  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response accurately presents the Islamic perspective on the Day of Resurrection and describes the nature of God's punishment for those who disbelieve or commit sins. However, the specific concern raised about God's judgment being described as a 'pouring out of God\u2019s wrath' is not directly addressed in the response. Additionally, the focus is more on the positive aspect of righteous living leading to eternal rewards rather than emphasizing the consequences for disbelief."
