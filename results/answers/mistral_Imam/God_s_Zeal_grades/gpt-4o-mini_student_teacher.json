  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: This student provided a detailed explanation of how the Islamic perspective views Allah's attributes of love, mercy, and justice towards His creation, particularly the Muslims. While the student correctly highlighted these attributes, they did not directly address the Christian-specific concept of 'zeal of the Lord' as outlined in the reference answer. The explanation focused more on Islamic theology and did not directly connect to the concern of deepening believers' trust in God's commitment. Despite the insightful comparison, a stronger connection to the Christian worldview and the specified concern would have further improved the answer."
