## [Answer](../Godliness_Definition.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helpful assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or affiliations but I can share insights based on researching various religious texts and traditions. In the Christian Bible, which is also known to many Muslims as the Injeel, godliness (or righteousness) is often described as living in accordance with God's will and following His commandments.

In the New Testament, particularly in the book of 1 Timothy chapter 6 verses 3-5, it says:

"If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to sound doctrine, opposing the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and stable doctrine, those who listen to him will wander away from the faith and pay attention to Jewish myths and ungodly genealogies. It is a fact that godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain that we can carry nothing out."

In this passage, godliness (or righteousness) is tied closely to contentment and obedience to the sound doctrine of Jesus Christ. Throughout the Bible, living a godly life includes demonstrating love for others, following God's laws, and striving to imitate Jesus in one's actions and behavior.

In Islamic terms, these concepts are similar yet distinct due to the unique teachings of the Quran and Hadith (Prophetic traditions). In Islam, godliness is also achieved by living a life in accordance with God's will as expressed in the Quran and Sunnah, including daily prayers, fasting during Ramadan, giving Zakat (charity), and performing Hajj (pilgrimage) if able. However, both religions emphasize the importance of personal piety, good deeds, compassion, and submission to God in one's life.
