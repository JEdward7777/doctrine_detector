The incorporation of examples from the New Testament and explanation of how godliness is tied to contentment and following Jesus' teachings adds depth to the discussion. However, there could be further elaboration on practical ways to apply godliness in daily life, such as through prayer, study of the Scriptures, acts of kindness, and seeking to imitate Christ in all aspects of life."
