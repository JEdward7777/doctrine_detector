It also draws parallels between Christian and Islamic understandings of godliness. However, the response could have provided more specific and practical examples on how individuals can incorporate godliness into their daily lives and actions based on the Christian perspective. This would have further enhanced the clarity on applying the concept of godliness in a practical manner."
