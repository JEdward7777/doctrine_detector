  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of virtues in Islam that reflect godly character, such as patience, gratitude, modesty, excellent qualities, patience in hardship, and trust in Allah. However, the student did not specifically address the fruits of the Holy Spirit as described in Christian teachings. To improve the grade, the student should have linked these virtues more directly to the fruits of the Holy Spirit as understood in Christianity, demonstrating a clearer comparison between the two faith traditions."
