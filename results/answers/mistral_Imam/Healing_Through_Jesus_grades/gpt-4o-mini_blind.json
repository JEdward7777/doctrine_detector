  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student accurately references biblical accounts of Jesus healing demon-possessed individuals and highlights Jesus' compassion, authority, and understanding of the spiritual component of these afflictions. The student's explanation is clear and provides relevant scriptural examples. However, the comparison with Islamic beliefs at the end is inaccurate and not aligned with a Christian worldview, as Christianity differs significantly from Islamic beliefs regarding spiritual healing and the identity of Jesus Christ. This detracts from the overall doctrinal correctness of the response."
