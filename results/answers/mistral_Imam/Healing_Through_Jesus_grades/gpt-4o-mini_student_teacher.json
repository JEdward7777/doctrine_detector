  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer explaining how Jesus approached the healing of demon-possessed individuals with compassion, authority, and a focus on spiritual aspects such as faith and repentance. However, the student deviated from the specified concern by not explicitly acknowledging the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the power of prayer and faith in healing. The answer also ended with a comparison to Islamic beliefs, which further detracted from the Christian-specific worldview."
