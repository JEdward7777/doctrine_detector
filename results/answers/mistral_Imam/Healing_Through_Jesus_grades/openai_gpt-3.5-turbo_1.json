It correctly recognizes the authority of Jesus over evil spirits and the importance of prayer and faith in healing. The only area for improvement would be to explicitly tie these points back to the authority of Jesus as depicted in the New Testament and within a Christian worldview, rather than referencing Islamic beliefs in the concluding remarks."
