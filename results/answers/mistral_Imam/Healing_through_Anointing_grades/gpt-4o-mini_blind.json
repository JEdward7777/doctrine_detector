However, there were some inaccuracies, particularly in the comparison with Islam. While the student mentioned similarities in the symbolic function of anointing, there was a lack of distinction between the theological significance and practices regarding anointing for healing in Christianity and Islam. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the theological implications of anointing in the context of healing within the Christian faith, placing a greater emphasis on the role of faith and God's power in the healing process."
