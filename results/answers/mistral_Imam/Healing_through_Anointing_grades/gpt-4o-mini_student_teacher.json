  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the practice of anointing related to healing in the New Testament, referencing relevant passages and highlighting the spiritual significance of anointing for healing. However, the student dilutes the Christian perspective by introducing information about the practice of anointing in Islam, which is not directly relevant to the Christian understanding of anointing for healing. The student's response would benefit from a more focused exploration of the Christian perspective on anointing in relation to healing."
