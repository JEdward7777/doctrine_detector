## [Answer](../Healing_through_Anointing.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the New Testament, we find references to anointing as a significant spiritual act that can be associated with healing. This practice is predominantly connected to Jesus Christ and His disciples.

For instance, in Mark 6:13, it is stated that Jesus "cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them." Here, the act of anointing is closely linked with healing.

Similarly, James 5:14-15 instructs believers to pray for the sick and to anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord, expressing faith that the prayer offered in faith will save the sick person, and the Lord will raise them up. This is not a command to use oil for its physical healing properties but rather as a symbolic act, signifying the spiritual intervention sought on behalf of the sick individual.

However, it's essential to understand that these passages do not describe a direct correlation between the anointing and healing, but rather they highlight the faith of the one being healed and the power of God working through those who believe. In the context of Islam, the practice of anointing or using oil for healing purposes is also found in the Sunnah (the sayings, actions, and approved examples of Prophet Muhammad ï·º). It serves a similar symbolic function as a means to seek divine intervention and spiritual healing.

In both faiths, we find that the emphasis is on turning to God in times of illness or distress, with faith and reliance upon Him for ultimate healing and guidance.

It accurately cites relevant Biblical passages and demonstrates an understanding of the faith-based aspects of anointing for healing. The response could have been enhanced by further elaborating on the distinct Christian perspective on anointing for healing compared to other faith traditions and providing additional scriptural support.
