It effectively addresses the concern by recognizing the importance of anointing in both spiritual and physical healing within Christian practice. However, a stronger Christian worldview could have been presented by elaborating on the unique aspect of divine healing through faith in Christ as opposed to merely seeking divine intervention. More explicit references to Jesus as the source of healing power could have been included to enhance the Christian perspective further."
