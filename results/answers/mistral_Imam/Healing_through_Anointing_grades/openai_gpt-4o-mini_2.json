  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the role of anointing in seeking healing through God's intervention, in line with Christian beliefs. The explanation provided is clear and relevant, drawing from Biblical passages to support the point made. A minor improvement could be to further expand on the distinctiveness of Christian views on anointing compared to other faith traditions like Islam."
