However, in this context, the question specifically asked for information within a Christian worldview, not an Islamic one. It would have been more appropriate to focus on Christian perspectives, such as referencing the Old Testament accounts and emphasizing the significance of the Ark within the Christian understanding of God's presence and covenant with His people."
