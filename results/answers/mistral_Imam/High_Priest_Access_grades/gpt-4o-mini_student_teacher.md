## Question [High Priest Access](../../../questions/High_Priest_Access.md)

## Correct Answer
Only the high priest could approach the ark, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant.

## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic tradition, we do not have any specific knowledge about the Ark of the Covenant as it is a part of Jewish history that is not mentioned in the Quran or Hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him). However, in the Jewish tradition, the Ark was kept in the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem. Only the high priest could approach the Ark once a year on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and then only after rigorous purification rituals and specific procedures were followed. This is according to the descriptions found in books like Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers in the Hebrew Bible.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a well-informed answer about the restrictions on approaching the Ark of the Covenant in the Jewish tradition, highlighting the role of the high priest and emphasizing the importance of the Day of Atonement. However, there was a lack of insight into how this relates to the Israelites' relationship with God and the covenant, which was the specified concern. The student could have connected the significance of the high priest's role in approaching the Ark to the mediation and intercessory role he played in maintaining Israel's covenant relationship with God.
