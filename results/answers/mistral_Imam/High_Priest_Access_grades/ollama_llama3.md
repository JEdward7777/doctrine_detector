## Question [High Priest Access](../../../questions/High_Priest_Access.md)
Who was allowed to approach the ark of the covenant and under what circumstances?

## Correct Answer
Only the high priest could approach the ark, and he did so once a year on the Day of Atonement.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the role of the high priest in the Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant.

## [Answer](../High_Priest_Access.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic tradition, we do not have any specific knowledge about the Ark of the Covenant as it is a part of Jewish history that is not mentioned in the Quran or Hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him). However, in the Jewish tradition, the Ark was kept in the Holy of Holies in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple in Jerusalem. Only the high priest could approach the Ark once a year on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and then only after rigorous purification rituals and specific procedures were followed. This is according to the descriptions found in books like Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers in the Hebrew Bible.

Comment: The response largely addresses the concern of recognizing the role of the high priest in Israelite's relationship with God and the covenant. It accurately states that only the high priest could approach the Ark once a year on the Day of Atonement, which is a key aspect of the Ark's significance in Jewish tradition. However, the response could be strengthened by further exploring the spiritual implications of the high priest's role and the Ark's connection to God's covenant with His people. Additionally, while the response does mention the Ark's location in the Tabernacle and Temple, it could provide more context on why this physical space was so important for Israelite worship and their relationship with God. Overall, a solid effort that demonstrates some understanding of the high priest's role but leaves room for further development.
