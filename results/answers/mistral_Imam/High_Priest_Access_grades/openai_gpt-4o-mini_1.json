It acknowledges the significance of the high priest in facilitating the relationship between the Israelites and God through the covenant, demonstrating an understanding of the role of the high priest in the religious practices of the Israelites. The only minor point for improvement would be to include a brief mention of the covenant itself in the explanation."
