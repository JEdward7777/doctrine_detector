It recognizes the significance of the high priest's specific and exclusive access to the Ark on the Day of Atonement, highlighting the importance of the high priest in mediating the relationship between the Israelites and God through the covenant. The response effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview by acknowledging the role of the high priest in upholding the covenant and facilitating atonement for the people's sins."
