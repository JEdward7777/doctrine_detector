## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Holy Quran, we find numerous verses that draw parallels with Biblical narratives, including those related to the concept of the "remnant" as mentioned in Isaiah (Isaiah 1:9) and Amos (Amos 5:15).

One significant event that exemplifies this idea is the story of Noah's Ark (Nuh in Islamic tradition). After the Flood, only a small group of people – Noah, his family, and the animals on the ark – were left as the "remnant" from whom all of humanity would be rebuilt. This group was chosen by God to continue the human lineage after a great destruction, much like the remnant mentioned in Isaiah and Amos.

Another event that illustrates the concept is the story of the Israelites' sojourn in Egypt and their subsequent exodus under the leadership of Moses (Musa in Islamic tradition). After the enslavement and suffering of the Israelites, a small group – those who remained faithful to God – were spared from the wrath that befell the Egyptians. The survivors became the basis for the new community established by Moses in the land of Canaan, thus serving as the "remnant" God had promised to protect and nurture (e.g., Exodus 32:9-14).

In both examples, we see a small group that has been chosen by God to continue His work in the world after a great calamity or upheaval. This group is referred to as the "remnant," who are responsible for preserving faithfulness and piety during challenging times and rebuilding society according to God's guidance.
