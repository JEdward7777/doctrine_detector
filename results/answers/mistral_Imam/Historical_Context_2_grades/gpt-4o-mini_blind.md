## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe in the stories of the Prophets as they are mentioned in the Quran and Hadiths. The story of Moses (peace be upon him) and the Exodus is one such narrative. According to the Quran, the Israelites were in a great hurry during their escape from Egypt, and they did not have enough time to let their bread rise before baking it. This is why they ate unleavened bread, which is called Matzah or Saff (in Arabic) in this context. The haste was due to Pharaoh's pursuit, and Allah made the dough unleavened so that it would not spoil during their rapid journey.

In Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 51, Allah says: "And We caused them to follow in the footsteps of Our servant Moses (Musa), after he had been afflicted with hardship: for We had already granted him clear arguments and evidence of authority. And We parted the sea for them so they passed through it dry-shod, and We drowned their pursuers."

The commemoration of this event is celebrated annually in Judaism as Passover (Pesach). In Islam, there are similar observances during the Night Journey and Ascension of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), specifically during Laylatul-Qadr (Night of Power) in the month of Ramadan.

Comment: The answer provided gives a perspective on the story of Moses from an Islamic viewpoint rather than a Christian one. While it is informative from an Islamic standpoint, it does not align with a Christian-specific worldview, which would focus on the biblical account of the Israelites' escape from Egypt. The explanation lacks references to biblical passages and Christian beliefs regarding the significance of unleavened bread in the Old Testament context. A correct Christian perspective would emphasize the obedience of the Israelites in following God's instructions regarding unleavened bread as a symbol of purity and haste in leaving Egypt.
