The relevance to the concern of recognizing historical events shaping religious practices is somewhat addressed through the comparison of Passover in Judaism and Islamic observances, but the direct explanation falls short. More focus on the specific reason given in the reference answer and its significance within the historical context would have enhanced the response."
