  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 60.\n\nThe response accurately explains why the Israelites ate unleavened bread, citing their haste in fleeing Egypt as instructed by God. This aligns with the given answer and demonstrates an understanding of the historical event that shaped Jewish religious practice (Passover).\n\nHowever, I deduct points because the response does not explicitly connect this event to Christian faith and practices. While it mentions Islamic observances during the Night Journey and Ascension, it does not demonstrate a clear recognition of the shared historical context between Judaism and Christianity.\n\nTo achieve a higher grade, the response could more explicitly highlight the continuity between Jewish (Passover) and Christian (e.g., Eucharist) celebrations, emphasizing how these events shape and inform one another."
