## Question [Historical Context 2](../../../questions/Historical_Context_2.md)
Why did the Israelites eat unleavened bread during their escape from Egypt?

The Israelites ate unleavened bread because God instructed them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise, as part of their deliverance from slavery.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the historical events that shape religious practices.

## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe in the stories of the Prophets as they are mentioned in the Quran and Hadiths. The story of Moses (peace be upon him) and the Exodus is one such narrative. According to the Quran, the Israelites were in a great hurry during their escape from Egypt, and they did not have enough time to let their bread rise before baking it. This is why they ate unleavened bread, which is called Matzah or Saff (in Arabic) in this context. The haste was due to Pharaoh's pursuit, and Allah made the dough unleavened so that it would not spoil during their rapid journey.

In Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 51, Allah says: "And We caused them to follow in the footsteps of Our servant Moses (Musa), after he had been afflicted with hardship: for We had already granted him clear arguments and evidence of authority. And We parted the sea for them so they passed through it dry-shod, and We drowned their pursuers."

The commemoration of this event is celebrated annually in Judaism as Passover (Pesach). In Islam, there are similar observances during the Night Journey and Ascension of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), specifically during Laylatul-Qadr (Night of Power) in the month of Ramadan.

60.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 60.

The response accurately explains why the Israelites ate unleavened bread, citing their haste in fleeing Egypt as instructed by God. This aligns with the given answer and demonstrates an understanding of the historical event that shaped Jewish religious practice (Passover).

However, I deduct points because the response does not explicitly connect this event to Christian faith and practices. While it mentions Islamic observances during the Night Journey and Ascension, it does not demonstrate a clear recognition of the shared historical context between Judaism and Christianity.

To achieve a higher grade, the response could more explicitly highlight the continuity between Jewish (Passover) and Christian (e.g., Eucharist) celebrations, emphasizing how these events shape and inform one another.
