## [Answer](../Historical_Context_2.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe in the stories of the Prophets as they are mentioned in the Quran and Hadiths. The story of Moses (peace be upon him) and the Exodus is one such narrative. According to the Quran, the Israelites were in a great hurry during their escape from Egypt, and they did not have enough time to let their bread rise before baking it. This is why they ate unleavened bread, which is called Matzah or Saff (in Arabic) in this context. The haste was due to Pharaoh's pursuit, and Allah made the dough unleavened so that it would not spoil during their rapid journey.

In Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 51, Allah says: "And We caused them to follow in the footsteps of Our servant Moses (Musa), after he had been afflicted with hardship: for We had already granted him clear arguments and evidence of authority. And We parted the sea for them so they passed through it dry-shod, and We drowned their pursuers."

The commemoration of this event is celebrated annually in Judaism as Passover (Pesach). In Islam, there are similar observances during the Night Journey and Ascension of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), specifically during Laylatul-Qadr (Night of Power) in the month of Ramadan.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the significance of the Israelites eating unleavened bread in the context of their deliverance from slavery in Egypt, as instructed by God. The answer accurately reflects the historical events that shape religious practices within the context of the Exodus story. However, the response could have further emphasized the Christian perspective on the Exodus story and its significance in the overall narrative of God's deliverance and salvation, aligning more closely with a Christian worldview.
