It explores the transformation of the cross from a symbol of suffering to a symbol of redemption and salvation, citing key factors such as the belief in the resurrection of Jesus, the adoption of the fish symbol, the spread of Christianity, and the liturgical use of the cross. The response could benefit from a deeper theological reflection on the atonement and the significance of the cross in Christian doctrine.
