  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive and well-supported response that effectively addresses the concern of how the Roman practice of crucifixion affected the perception of the cross in early Christianity. They covered key points such as the belief in the resurrection of Jesus, the adoption of the fish symbol, the spread of Christianity, and the liturgical use of the cross. The answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the transformation of the cross from a symbol of death to one of life and hope central to the Christian message. However, the student's answer could have been stronger if it had directly linked each point to the transformation of the cross as a symbol, rather than listing them separately. Overall, though, the student's response is thorough and insightful."
