However, the focus is primarily on Islamic tradition rather than Christian perspective. While it is informative to learn about the connections between different religions, the concern is specifically about inspiring Christians in their faith and devotion. Therefore, the response could have been enhanced by emphasizing the importance of these acts within a Christian worldview and how Christians can draw inspiration from these examples in building altars and expressing their faith through intentional acts of worship."
