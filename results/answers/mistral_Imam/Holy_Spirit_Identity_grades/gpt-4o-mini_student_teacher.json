  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed comparison between the Christian and Islamic perspectives on the Holy Spirit, they failed to directly address the concern that understanding the divine nature of the Holy Spirit is essential for Christians to engage fully with his guidance and support. The student's answer did not focus specifically on how the identity of the Holy Spirit as God influences the way Christians view his role in their lives. Thus, the grade is lower as the response missed the main point of the question."
