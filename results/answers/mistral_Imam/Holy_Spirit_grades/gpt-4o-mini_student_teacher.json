However, the response lacks a clear emphasis on the Holy Spirit as part of the triune Godhead. A stronger focus on teaching the unique Christian understanding of the Holy Spirit's divinity and role in the believer's life would have been more aligned with a Christian worldview. While providing insights into the Islamic perspective is valuable, it should be balanced with a clear presentation of the Christian belief in the Holy Spirit as God's Spirit within the Trinity."
