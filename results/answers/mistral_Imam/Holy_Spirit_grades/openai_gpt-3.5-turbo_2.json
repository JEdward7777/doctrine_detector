However, it falls short in addressing the concern of preventing misconceptions about the Holy Spirit's identity and work. The response could have included a clearer distinction between the Christian view of the Holy Spirit as part of the Trinity and the Islamic belief in the Holy Spirit as an angelic messenger. Emphasizing the differences in the nature and role of the Holy Spirit in both faiths would have helped to address the concern more effectively."
