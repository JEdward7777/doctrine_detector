The student does a good job explaining how Islam views hope and despair in relation to God's mercy and forgiveness. However, the response could further address the implications of hopelessness in a Christian worldview by emphasizing the importance of faith, trust in God's promises, and the detrimental effects of losing hope in God's ultimate goodness and sovereignty."
