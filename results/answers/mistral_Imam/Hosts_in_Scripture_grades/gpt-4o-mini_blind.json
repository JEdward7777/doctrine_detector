  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive overview of how the term \"hosts\" is used in Islamic scripture, specifically referring to celestial beings such as angels and jinn. However, since the question pertains to the term as used in Christian scripture, the answer does not directly address that aspect. The explanation on Islamic beliefs is thorough, but the lack of application to the Christian context affects the overall grade."
