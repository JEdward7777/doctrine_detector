  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of how the term \"hosts\" is used in Islamic scripture, specifically referring to angels, jinn, and the Companions of Prophet Muhammad. However, the response did not directly address the Christian perspective on the term 'hosts' in scripture and how it relates to spiritual warfare and divine authority, as requested in the concern. To improve the grade, the student should incorporate insights from a Christian worldview to demonstrate an understanding of the impact on prayer and spiritual battles."
