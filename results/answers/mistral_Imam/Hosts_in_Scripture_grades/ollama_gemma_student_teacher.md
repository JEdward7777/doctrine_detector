## [Answer](../Hosts_in_Scripture.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic scripture, the term "hosts" or "armies" (in Arabic: جُنود, junud) is often used to describe celestial beings, angels, or forces of good, as well as jinn (spiritual creatures mentioned in the Quran).

The hosts or armies of angels include those sent specifically for various tasks, such as recording human actions (Al-Kiraman Katibin), maintaining the throne of God (Ar-Raqaba), and those who are responsible for guarding Hellfire (Azra'il). The Quran also mentions that there are armies of angels which protect cities and nations, and the hosts of angels gather in significant religious events like the Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj) of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

The term can sometimes refer to jinn as well, who, according to Islamic belief, have their own communities or societies. However, it is important to note that the Quran clearly states that jinn are created from smokeless fire and do not share the same nature as humans (Surah Al-Jinn 7:19-20).

In a broader context, the term hosts can also be used in narrations (hadith) to describe the Companions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who were collectively referred to as his host or army.
