The response appropriately emphasizes the spiritual aspects of the term. However, from a Christian worldview, the significance of spiritual warfare and divine authority could have been further explored in relation to the understanding of hosts in scripture. Integrating these concepts would enhance the response's alignment with a Christian-specific worldview."
