However, in terms of a Christian worldview, there was no direct engagement with the concern raised regarding the impact of understanding spiritual warfare and divine authority on prayer and spiritual battles. Connecting the concept of hosts in Islamic scripture to the Christian perspective on spiritual warfare and prayer would have strengthened the response."
