The connection to Prophet Muhammad and his Companions is also well explained. However, from a Christian worldview concerning spiritual warfare and divine authority, it is crucial to acknowledge the difference in the nature and origin of angels and jinn compared to the Judeo-Christian perspective, which may impact how believers understand prayer and engage in spiritual battles. Therefore, the response could have delved deeper into this consideration to provide a more holistic evaluation."
