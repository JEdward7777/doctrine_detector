  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's response provides valuable insights from an Islamic perspective on managing feelings of jealousy in relationships through self-improvement, seeking Allah's guidance, and trusting in His plan. However, the response focuses more on individual reflection and spiritual practices than on addressing the impact of jealousy on personal relationships. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes the importance of open communication and building trust in relationships, which the student's response lacks. Overall, while the student's perspective is valuable, the emphasis on interpersonal dynamics could have been stronger."
