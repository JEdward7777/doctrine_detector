  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and informative explanation of how a person can be declared righteous according to the Christian faith, emphasizing the role of faith in Jesus Christ and His atonement for sin. Although the student did not explicitly state that righteousness is imputed to believers through Jesus' sacrifice, they did touch on the key concept of justification by faith. However, the response could have been strengthened by explicitly mentioning that God attributes Jesus' righteousness to believers when they trust in Him for salvation, as mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the student demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but could have been more precise in aligning with the specific concern provided."
