## [Answer](../Human_Righteousness.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or faith. However, I can provide information about various religious perspectives based on research. In Christianity, there are several passages and teachings that discuss righteousness. Here's a general understanding:

According to Christian teachings, a person is declared righteous not by their own actions, but through faith in Jesus Christ and His atonement for sin. This concept is often referred to as justification by faith. In Romans 3:22 (NIV), the Apostle Paul writes, "This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."

In the Old Testament, righteousness was often associated with obeying God's commands and living a life in accordance with His laws. However, Christianity teaches that due to human sinfulness, no one can attain perfect righteousness through their own efforts (Romans 3:10-12). It is only through faith in Jesus Christ, who lived a sinless life and died on the cross as atonement for sin, that one can be declared righteous.

It's important to note that interpretations of religious texts may vary among different Christian denominations and individuals. For a more specific understanding, it would be best to consult with a Christian scholar or clergy from the particular denomination in question.
