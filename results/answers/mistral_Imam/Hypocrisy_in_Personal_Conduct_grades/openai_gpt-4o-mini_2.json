However, the provided steps for a Muslim to avoid hypocrisy were not entirely compatible with a Christian worldview. While the concepts of sincerity, intention, repentance, and prayer are universal, they are understood and practiced differently in Christianity compared to Islam. To enhance the response from a Christian perspective, incorporating biblical references and teachings specific to Christian beliefs on sincerity, repentance, and living authentically according to God's Word would have been beneficial."
