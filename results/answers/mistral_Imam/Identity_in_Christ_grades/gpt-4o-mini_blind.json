  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student provided a detailed explanation of the concept of God calling individuals by name from Islamic scriptures. While the response is informative and well-written, the perspective is based on Islamic beliefs rather than a Christian worldview. For a higher grade, the student could have incorporated biblical passages or teachings that specifically address God calling individuals by name within the context of Christianity. Additionally, emphasizing the distinct Christian understanding of God's intimate relationship with His followers would have strengthened the response."
