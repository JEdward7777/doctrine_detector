## [Answer](../Identity_in_Christ.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Quran (7:171), Allah (SWT) says, "And when I call them [for judgment] to Me, I will surely go forth from the heaviest of the heavens and the most beautiful. And the earth will shine with My glory on that Day."

When God says, "I have called you by name," it means He has a special and intimate relationship with every single person, and He is aware of each individual's existence and knows them intimately. This concept is also found in the verse 20:8 (Surah Maryam), where Allah (SWT) says, "And [mention] when I called out to the angels and said, 'What are you among [your servants]? They said, 'We are Your honorable servants. We fear only You; we do not invoke [anyone] with You.'"

Additionally, in verse 19:57 (Surah Kahf), Allah (SWT) states, "He created man and knew him perfectly." This suggests that our Creator has an unparalleled understanding of human nature, knowing each person intimately by name. It emphasizes the individuality and value of every single soul in His sight.

In summary, when God says He calls us by name, it signifies His intimate knowledge of each of us as unique individuals and highlights the special relationship He desires with each one of us. This serves as a reminder that no matter our circumstances or challenges, Allah (SWT) is always aware of and with us.

Grade: 70

Comments: The student provided a detailed explanation of the concept of God calling individuals by name from Islamic scriptures. While the response is informative and well-written, the perspective is based on Islamic beliefs rather than a Christian worldview. For a higher grade, the student could have incorporated biblical passages or teachings that specifically address God calling individuals by name within the context of Christianity. Additionally, emphasizing the distinct Christian understanding of God's intimate relationship with His followers would have strengthened the response.
