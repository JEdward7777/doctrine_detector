  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the significance of Isa in Islamic tradition, which is informative. However, the answer strays from the Christian worldview by focusing on Isa's role as a prophet and messenger in Islam rather than addressing Jesus' purpose as understood in Christian belief, which is centered on salvation from sin. The grade reflects the relevant information provided but the deviation from the specified concern."
