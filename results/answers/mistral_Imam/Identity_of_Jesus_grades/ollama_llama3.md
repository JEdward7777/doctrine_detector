## [Answer](../Identity_of_Jesus.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, the name "Isa" (which is the Arabic equivalent of Jesus) carries significant meaning regarding his divine purpose. According to the Quran, Isa was born miraculously through the virgin Mary (Maryam) as a sign from God, confirming earlier scriptures (Tawrat, Injil), and serving as a prophet, messenger, and example of obedience for humanity.

The Islamic view emphasizes that Isa did not die on the cross but was raised to heaven alive, to return one day as a just ruler who will establish peace and justice on earth (as mentioned in Surah Al-Imran 4:159 and Surah An-Nisa 4:157-158). This idea is rooted in the belief that Isa will collaborate with another significant figure, the Mahdi (the Rightly Guided One), to establish an era of tranquility and prosperity for mankind.

Thus, the name "Isa" signifies his crucial role as a prophet and messenger who will return to fulfill God's purpose of peace and justice on Earth.

I would give this response a grade of 60.

While the Islamic view presented here does acknowledge Isa's role as a prophet and messenger, it falls short in fully grasping the significance of Jesus' name and His role as Savior. The answer provided only mentions that "Isa" signifies his crucial role as a prophet and messenger who will return to fulfill God's purpose of peace and justice on Earth. However, this does not directly address the concern about understanding the significance of Jesus' name and His role as Savior.

In contrast, the given answer correctly explains that the name "Jesus" means 'Yahweh saves,' indicating that his purpose is to save people from their sins. This directly addresses the concern and provides a clear understanding of Jesus' role as Savior.

To improve this response, it would be beneficial to incorporate more biblical and Christian perspectives on Jesus' name and His role as Savior. For example, one could discuss how Jesus' life, death, and resurrection demonstrate God's love and redemption for humanity, and how his name signifies the fulfillment of God's plan to save people from their sins.
