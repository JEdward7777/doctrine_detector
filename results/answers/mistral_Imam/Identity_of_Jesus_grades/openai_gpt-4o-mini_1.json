In a Christian perspective, the name \"Jesus\" means \"Yahweh saves,\" emphasizing His central role in saving humanity from sin through His sacrificial death on the cross and resurrection. It is important to address this central aspect of Jesus's identity in the context of His significance as the Savior in Christian belief."
