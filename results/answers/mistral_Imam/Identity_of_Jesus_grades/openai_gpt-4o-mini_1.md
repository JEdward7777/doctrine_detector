## [Answer](../Identity_of_Jesus.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, the name "Isa" (which is the Arabic equivalent of Jesus) carries significant meaning regarding his divine purpose. According to the Quran, Isa was born miraculously through the virgin Mary (Maryam) as a sign from God, confirming earlier scriptures (Tawrat, Injil), and serving as a prophet, messenger, and example of obedience for humanity.

The Islamic view emphasizes that Isa did not die on the cross but was raised to heaven alive, to return one day as a just ruler who will establish peace and justice on earth (as mentioned in Surah Al-Imran 4:159 and Surah An-Nisa 4:157-158). This idea is rooted in the belief that Isa will collaborate with another significant figure, the Mahdi (the Rightly Guided One), to establish an era of tranquility and prosperity for mankind.

Thus, the name "Isa" signifies his crucial role as a prophet and messenger who will return to fulfill God's purpose of peace and justice on Earth.

Grade: 30

Comment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on Isa (Jesus), his role, and future return but does not directly address the concern regarding the significance of Jesus's name and His role as Savior from a Christian worldview. In a Christian perspective, the name "Jesus" means "Yahweh saves," emphasizing His central role in saving humanity from sin through His sacrificial death on the cross and resurrection. It is important to address this central aspect of Jesus's identity in the context of His significance as the Savior in Christian belief.
