However, it did not directly address the concern about understanding the significance of Jesus's name and His role as Savior from a Christian worldview, which is essential in this context. The response focused on the Islamic beliefs about Isa rather than comparing them to the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Savior who saves people from their sins."
