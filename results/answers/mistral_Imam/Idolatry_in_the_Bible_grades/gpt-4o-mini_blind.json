  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has accurately described the consequences of idolatry among God's people in the Bible, focusing on the incident of the golden calf in Exodus. The explanation is well-supported with relevant biblical references and demonstrates an understanding of the seriousness of idolatry incurring the wrath of God. The response could be enhanced by elaborating on the theological implications of idolatry and emphasizing the necessity of repentance and turning back to God. Overall, a solid examination with room for deeper theological reflection."
