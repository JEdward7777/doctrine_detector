It acknowledges the importance of this understanding in the practice of forgiveness and reconciliation within the Christian community. The integration of Christian principles and teachings, such as the golden rule, adds depth to the analysis. However, to enhance the response, a more explicit connection between the concept of iniquity as harmful acts and forgiveness/reconciliation could be made through specific examples or biblical references."
