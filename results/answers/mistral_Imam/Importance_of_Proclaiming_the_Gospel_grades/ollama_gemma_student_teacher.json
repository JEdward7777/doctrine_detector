  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the importance of proclaiming the \"Good News\" within Christianity. It provides relevant scriptural references and articulates the motivation behind this mandate. However, the response could benefit from a more direct connection to the specific concern expressed in the grading criteria, which emphasizes Jesus' instruction to proclaim the message before his return."
