However, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness from a Christian perspective. The explanation veers off into Islamic beliefs about Jesus's crucifixion, which is not within the scope of the question. The focus should have remained on Christian scripture and teachings regarding the roles of the Sadducees and Pharisees in the crucifixion of Jesus. Additionally, the response could benefit from a clearer connection between the influence of these groups and their character, as well as a stronger emphasis on the significance of Jesus' crucifixion in Christian theology."
