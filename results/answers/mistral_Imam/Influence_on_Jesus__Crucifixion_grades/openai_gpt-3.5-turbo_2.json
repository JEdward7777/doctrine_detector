However, the answer lacks depth in drawing a direct connection between the influence of the Sadducees and Pharisees on the Roman leaders' decision to crucify Jesus, and the mention of selfishness and hypocrisy without further elaboration may oversimplify the complexities of the historical events. Additionally, there is a significant focus on differences in religious beliefs and interpretations between Christianity and Islam, which while informative, does not directly address the concern at hand. Further engagement with the specific dynamics of the conflict and its implications for contemporary faith would enhance the response."
