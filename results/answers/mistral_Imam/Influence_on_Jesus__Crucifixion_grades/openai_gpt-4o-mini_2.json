  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response accurately discusses the roles of the Sadducees and Pharisees in the crucifixion of Jesus based on Christian scripture. However, it fails to address the concern regarding the conflict between Jesus and religious leaders and its relevance for contemporary faith. The explanation provided lacks depth and fails to draw meaningful connections for understanding the significance of this historical conflict for modern-day faith practices."
