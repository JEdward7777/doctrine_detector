## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helper in this conversation, I would like to clarify that I am here to provide information based on various religious texts and scholarly interpretations. In the Islamic perspective, the story of Abraham (Ibrahim) and his descendants is an integral part of our faith as it appears in both the Quran and Hadiths.

In terms of the land of Canaan or Palestine, the promise made to Abraham and his descendants can be found in several verses of the Quran:

1) Surah Ibrahim (Ayat 73-74): "We covenanted with him [Abraham] and raised with him his family and Abraham was Our close friend. And We granted him the position of a leader [Prophet], bringing kings to him. Peace and safety on us and on Abraham, for we are Muslims [submitting to God's will]. Thus indeed were We rendering him grateful."

2) Surah Al-Baqarah (Ayat 124): "And when his Lord said to him, 'Submit [yourself]!' [Abraham] said: '[I submit] to the Lord of all worlds.' And Abraham's descendant [Ismael] inherited the east and west [of the land]."

These verses suggest that God made a covenant with Abraham, who was a close friend (Khalil) of God, promising him peace, safety, and leadership. His descendant Ishmael (Ismael) inherited the east and west lands, which some scholars interpret as referring to the regions surrounding the Kaaba in Makkah and the land of Canaan.

It is essential to remember that these verses should be understood in the broader context of Islamic teachings about brotherhood among all peoples and the call for justice, peace, and compassion towards all creation. The promise made to Abraham and his descendants in the Quranic narrative does not justify any form of discrimination or injustice against others.

As always, it is crucial to engage in open-minded dialogue and critical thinking when studying religious texts and interpretations. I encourage you to consult knowledgeable scholars, study various perspectives, and seek a deeper understanding of these complex topics through prayer, reflection, and contemplation.
