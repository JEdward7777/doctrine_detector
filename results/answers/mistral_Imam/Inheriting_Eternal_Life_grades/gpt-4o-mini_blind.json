It also presents information from Islam, which is not relevant to the question asked. A more accurate answer would have emphasized the belief in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, acknowledging Him as Lord and Savior, and accepting His sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins as the way to inherit eternal life, based on passages such as John 3:16 and Romans 10:9-10."
