  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer provides some information on the path to eternal life according to the Bible but lacks a clear and direct reference to Jesus' teachings. They mention the importance of keeping God's commandments and having faith, which are indeed significant aspects, but the specific emphasis on following the teachings of Jesus is missing. The student also attempts to include information about Islam, which is not relevant to the question at hand. To improve the grade, they should focus more on the teachings of Jesus regarding eternal life and salvation."
