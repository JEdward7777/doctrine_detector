  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer adequately addresses the concern by clarifying the path to salvation and eternal life as taught by Jesus in the New Testament. It correctly references the relevant scripture (Mark 10:17-27) and acknowledges the variations in interpretations among Christian denominations. However, the answer could benefit from a more explicit statement about the need for faith in Jesus Christ as the only way to inherit eternal life, as taught in the reference answer."
