However, the initial response also includes relevant information from the Bible and acknowledges the importance of consulting with religious leaders for a comprehensive understanding within one's specific tradition. The connection to Jesus' teachings could have been emphasized more strongly, but overall, the response effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview."
