## [Answer](../Inheriting_Eternal_Life.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or affiliations, but I can share information based on various religious texts. In the New Testament of the Bible, it is stated in Mark 10:17-27 that eternal life can be inherited through keeping God's commandments and having faith. However, interpretations may vary among different Christian denominations and scholars. It's essential to consult with knowledgeable religious leaders for a comprehensive understanding within your specific tradition. In Islam, the way to attain eternal life is by believing in Allah (God), following His guidance as revealed in the Quran, and leading a righteous life.
