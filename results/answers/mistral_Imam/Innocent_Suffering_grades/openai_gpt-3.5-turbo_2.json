  "grade_comment": "Grade: 88\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the concept of \"innocent blood\" in biblical scripture, emphasizing the sanctity of life and the injustice of wrongful death. It effectively ties the concept to broader themes of justice, righteousness, and moral implications within society. The response could have been enhanced by more specific references to additional biblical passages or theological reflections on the implications of this concept, but overall, it is a solid and insightful analysis."
