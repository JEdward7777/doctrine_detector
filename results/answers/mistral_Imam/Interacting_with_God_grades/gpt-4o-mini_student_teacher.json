  "grade": 65.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give the student's answer a grade of 65. While the student provides a well-thought-out response from a Muslim perspective on how responses to God can impact His will for our lives, the answer does not fully align with the concern provided. The student's answer focuses more on the individual's actions and consequences within the belief system of Islam rather than addressing the concern about how choices influence the relationship with God and the unfolding of His plans from a Christian perspective. Additionally, there is a theological difference between the Christian concept of God's will and the emphasis on free will in Islam. The answer could have been strengthened by directly addressing the Christian worldview and referencing biblical principles on how choices impact God's plans for our lives."
