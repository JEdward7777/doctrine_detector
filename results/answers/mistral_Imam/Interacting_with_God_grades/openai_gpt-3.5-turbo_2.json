From a Christian perspective, while the concepts of obedience, repentance, gratitude, perseverance, and good deeds are relevant, the emphasis should be on aligning our choices with God's will through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. The response lacked explicit references to Jesus as the focal point of our relationship with God and how our choices impact His plans for us as Christians."
