While the discussion is insightful, the Christian concern provided focuses on how choices influence the relationship with God and the unfolding of His plans specifically for Christians. While there are parallels between the Islamic and Christian beliefs on obedience, repentance, gratitude, perseverance, good deeds, and charity, the foundational differences in the understanding of God's nature and salvation through Jesus Christ should be addressed for a more in-depth and relevant discussion from a Christian worldview."
