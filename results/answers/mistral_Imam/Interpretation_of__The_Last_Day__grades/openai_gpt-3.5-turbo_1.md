# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Christian teaching, "The Last Day" or "Doomsday" refers to the end of time, often associated with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment. This concept is based on various passages in the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, such as Matthew 24:36, Mark 13:26-27, and Revelation 20:11-15.

In Christian eschatology, it is believed that on this day, God will judge all people who have ever lived, rewarding the righteous with eternal life in heaven and condemning the wicked to eternal punishment in hell. It's important to note that interpretations of these events can vary widely among different Christian denominations.

In contrast, Islam does not share the same eschatological beliefs about a single final judgment day or apocalypse. Instead, Muslims believe in a series of smaller resurrections and judgments after each person's death, with the major Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiyamah) happening only at the end of time. This event will be preceded by several significant signs, including the emergence of Dajjal (the Antichrist), the reappearance of Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary), and the descent of the Mahdi (the rightly guided one).

However, it is always beneficial for Muslims and Christians to engage in open and respectful dialogue about our shared values and beliefs, seeking common ground while respecting our differences.
