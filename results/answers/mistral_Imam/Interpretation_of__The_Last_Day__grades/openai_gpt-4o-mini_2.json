However, it could have been improved by explicitly tying the concept of judgment to the urgency of faith and the importance of one's relationship with God, which are crucial aspects of Christian theology. Additionally, a stronger emphasis on the need for repentance and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ could have been included to better address the concern raised."
