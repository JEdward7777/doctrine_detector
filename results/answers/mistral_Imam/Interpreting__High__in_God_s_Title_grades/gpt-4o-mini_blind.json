  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the answer provides insight into the Islamic interpretation of the term \"Most High,\" it does not align with a Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, the term \"Most High\" emphasizes God's supremacy, sovereignty, and transcendence over all creation. The response should have focused on these aspects of God's nature rather than solely on omniscience. The lack of Christian doctrinal correctness significantly impacts the grade."
