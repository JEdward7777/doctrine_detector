  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-thought-out explanation from an Islamic perspective on the term \"Most High\" when referring to God. While they highlighted the attributes of God related to knowledge and wisdom, they did not directly address the concern of interpreting the term 'high' in the title. The student's answer aligns with the reference answer in emphasizing God's greatness and authority, but lacks specificity in addressing the metaphorical use of descriptive titles."
