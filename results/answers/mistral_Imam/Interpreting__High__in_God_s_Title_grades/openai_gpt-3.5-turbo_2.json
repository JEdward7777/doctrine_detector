  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 90.\n\nThe student's response does a good job of explaining the meaning of the term \"Most High\" in Islamic belief, highlighting the attributes of God as described in the Islamic tradition. They accurately convey the significance of God's infinite knowledge, wisdom, and understanding.\n\nHowever, the concern raised emphasizes the importance of understanding the metaphorical use of descriptive titles and avoiding misconceptions about God's nature. While the student's response does not directly address this concern, they provide a well-articulated and informative explanation of the term \"Most High\" within Islamic belief.\n\nOverall, the response is strong in content but could have been improved by addressing the concern raised."
