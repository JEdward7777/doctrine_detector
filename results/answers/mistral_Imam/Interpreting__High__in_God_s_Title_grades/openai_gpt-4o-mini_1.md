 In Islamic belief, the term "Most High" (Al-Aleem in Arabic) when referring to God, signifies His infinite knowledge, wisdom, and understanding of all things. It implies that He is above and beyond the limitations of human comprehension, and nothing escapes His awareness. This attribute emphasizes God's omniscience, which encompasses past, present, and future events. The term serves to remind us of our absolute dependence on Him for all knowledge and guidance in life.
