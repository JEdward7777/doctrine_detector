They correctly mention the renaming of Jacob by God and the meaning of the name Israel as \"he who struggles with God.\" However, the answer becomes less focused on the biblical context as it delves into the modern nation-state of Israel and its relevance in Islamic tradition. To improve, the student could have provided more depth on the biblical significance of the name Israel without deviating into unrelated topics."
