However, the inclusion of non-biblical perspectives, such as Islamic teachings and the modern nation-state of Israel, deviates from the concern of focusing solely on the biblical significance of the name. To improve the grade, the response should have maintained a more concentrated focus on the biblical explanation of the name \"Israel.\""
