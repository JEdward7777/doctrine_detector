## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences, but I can share information based on various interpretations within Islamic tradition regarding the topic you've asked about. The question refers to a passage in the Gospel of John (19:28-30) that describes Jesus saying "I am thirsty" and offering him a sour wine mixed with myrrh to drink.

In Islamic tradition, it is believed that this offer did not represent actual intoxication or crucifixion as an act of punishment (as Christians believe), but rather symbolized a divine demonstration of Jesus' submission to God's will and his agony during the crucifixion. This interpretation emphasizes Jesus' human nature, highlighting his suffering and the intensity of his thirst. Myrrh, which has medicinal properties, is also thought to have been used as a painkiller or anesthetic in this context.

It's important to note that interpretations can vary among Muslim scholars and within different Islamic traditions. This response represents one common understanding based on the Hadith Qudsi (a saying of Prophet Muhammad that is not part of the Quran but is considered to express the words of God).
