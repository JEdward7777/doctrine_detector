It acknowledged the diverse interpretations within Islamic scholarship and highlighted the importance of reflecting on Jesus' refusal for deeper insights into his suffering and commitment to his mission. The Christian-specific concern was addressed well, showcasing a different perspective while respecting the original answer. Great effort in incorporating a Christian worldview perspective within an Islamic context."
