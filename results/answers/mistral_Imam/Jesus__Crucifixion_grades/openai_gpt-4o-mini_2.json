However, there was a lack of direct engagement with the Christian-specific concern regarding Jesus' refusal of the offer of wine mixed with myrrh. It would have been beneficial to offer insights from a Christian perspective to provide a more holistic analysis of the significance of Jesus' refusal in relation to his mission and suffering."
