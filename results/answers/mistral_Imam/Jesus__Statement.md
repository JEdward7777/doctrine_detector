## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold religious beliefs, but I can help explain interpretations based on various scholarly perspectives within Islam. In the Gospel of John (11:25), Jesus is reported to have said, "I am the resurrection and the life." This statement can be understood from a Muslim perspective in light of the shared Abrahamic belief in the Day of Judgment, Resurrection, and the afterlife.

In Islamic tradition, Jesus (Isa) is considered one of the great prophets of God and his mission is not associated with divine sonship as interpreted by some Christian denominations. Instead, Muslims believe that Jesus will return before the Day of Judgment to confirm Islam as the final message of God and to refute Christianity's claims about his divinity. In this context, Jesus' statement "I am the resurrection and the life" could be interpreted as a reference to his role in guiding people to the path that leads to eternal life and resurrection on the Day of Judgment.

It is essential to remember that interpretations may vary among scholars, and this explanation offers one possible perspective based on shared Abrahamic themes. For personal or religious matters, it's always best to consult knowledgeable Muslim scholars or clergy for guidance.
