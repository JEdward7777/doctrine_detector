  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a good explanation of Jesus' statement \"I am the Resurrection and the Life\" from an Islamic perspective, highlighting shared Abrahamic themes such as the Day of Judgment, Resurrection, and the afterlife. The writer also acknowledges that interpretations may vary among scholars, which shows humility and respect for different perspectives.\n\nHowever, the response does not directly address the concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection, instead providing a more general explanation of his statement. While the response is well-written and informative, it could be stronger in its relevance to the specific concern.\n\nGrade: 85\n\nComment: This response demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic perspectives on Jesus' statement, but could benefit from a more direct address of the concern about clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection."
