However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of Jesus' unique role as the Son of God in Christian theology, which is central to understanding the concept of resurrection in Christianity. A more in-depth exploration of the theological implications of Jesus' divinity in relation to resurrection would have strengthened the explanation from a Christian worldview."
