However, from a Christian worldview, it falls short in addressing the concern of clarifying Jesus' identity and role in resurrection for faith and theological understanding. The response does not engage with the significance of Jesus' divinity and unique role as the Son of God in the Christian faith, which is crucial in understanding the full depth of his statement."
