However, the answer lacks depth and a clear focus on how Jesus specifically used the term \"Amen\" to emphasize His teachings in a Christian context. The answer could have been improved by elaborating more on Jesus' use of \"Amen\" in the context of His authoritative teaching style and the significance of His affirmations."
