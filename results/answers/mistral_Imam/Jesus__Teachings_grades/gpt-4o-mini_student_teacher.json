However, the student did not fully address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture from a Christian worldview. The answer lacks a clear emphasis on the authority and divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, which is essential in understanding the significance of His use of \"Amen\" in affirming His teachings."
