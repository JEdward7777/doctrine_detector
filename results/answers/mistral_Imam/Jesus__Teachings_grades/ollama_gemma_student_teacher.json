  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern by recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. It provides a relevant explanation of how Jesus used \"Amen\" to emphasize his teachings, citing a specific example from the Last Supper. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on other instances where Jesus used \"Amen\" to emphasize his teachings, as suggested by the reference answer."
