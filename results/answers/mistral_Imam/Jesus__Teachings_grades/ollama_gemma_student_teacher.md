## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, Prophet Isa (Jesus) is considered one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity. He is believed to have spoken only that which was inspired by Allah. As for the term "Amen," it is a word found in both the Torah and the Injeel (New Testament), which are the Jewish and Christian holy scriptures respectively, and it means "so be it" or "truly."

In Christian tradition, Jesus used "Amen" to affirm His teachings and prayers. For instance, during the Last Supper, He said: "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20), to which He added "Amen."

In the Islamic perspective, Prophet Isa also affirmed His teachings by saying "Amen," as it aligns with his prophetic nature and the divine inspiration behind his words. However, it's important to note that Islamic sources do not provide extensive details on specific uses of "Amen" in Jesus' (Isa) sayings.
