However, it does not fully address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. The answer provided as a comparison is somewhat vague and does not directly relate to the specific uses of \"Amen\" mentioned in the response.\n\nWhile the response acknowledges that Jesus used \"Amen\" to affirm His teachings and prayers, it does not delve deeper into how this relates to recognizing the authority of His words and teachings. The response also notes that Islamic sources do not provide extensive details on specific uses of \"Amen\" in Jesus' sayings, which could be explored further to demonstrate the importance of Jesus' teachings.\n\nOverall, while the response provides some relevant information, it does not adequately address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings."
