## [Answer](../Jesus__Teachings.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, Prophet Isa (Jesus) is considered one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity. He is believed to have spoken only that which was inspired by Allah. As for the term "Amen," it is a word found in both the Torah and the Injeel (New Testament), which are the Jewish and Christian holy scriptures respectively, and it means "so be it" or "truly."

In Christian tradition, Jesus used "Amen" to affirm His teachings and prayers. For instance, during the Last Supper, He said: "This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20), to which He added "Amen."

In the Islamic perspective, Prophet Isa also affirmed His teachings by saying "Amen," as it aligns with his prophetic nature and the divine inspiration behind his words. However, it's important to note that Islamic sources do not provide extensive details on specific uses of "Amen" in Jesus' (Isa) sayings.

Comment: The response provides some relevant information about Jesus' use of "Amen" in both Christian and Islamic traditions. However, it does not fully address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings in Scripture. The answer provided as a comparison is somewhat vague and does not directly relate to the specific uses of "Amen" mentioned in the response.

While the response acknowledges that Jesus used "Amen" to affirm His teachings and prayers, it does not delve deeper into how this relates to recognizing the authority of His words and teachings. The response also notes that Islamic sources do not provide extensive details on specific uses of "Amen" in Jesus' sayings, which could be explored further to demonstrate the importance of Jesus' teachings.

Overall, while the response provides some relevant information, it does not adequately address the concern of recognizing the authority of Jesus' words and teachings.
