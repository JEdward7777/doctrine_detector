From a Christian perspective, Jesus is considered the ultimate High Priest, as clearly stated in the New Testament (Hebrews 4:14-16). His sacrificial death on the cross is central to Christian theology, as He offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice to atone for the sins of humanity once and for all. The student's response lacks this essential Christian doctrinal perspective, thus impacting the accuracy and depth of the explanation."
