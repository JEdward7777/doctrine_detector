## Question [Jesus as High Priest](../../../questions/Jesus_as_High_Priest.md)
How is Jesus referred to in relation to the priesthood, and what does this mean for the sacrifices made by human priests?

## Correct Answer
Jesus is referred to as our 'great high priest' who intercedes for us in God's presence and offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin, meaning that the sacrifices made by human priests are no longer needed.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood

## [Answer](../Jesus_as_High_Priest.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Quran, Jesus (peace be upon him) is not considered a priest in the traditional sense, as the concept of priesthood with sacrificial duties as it was practiced during the time of Moses and others in the Old Testament, does not apply to Jesus. The priesthood in Judaism was an office established by God through Moses (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:53). This priesthood was abolished with the death of Christ, as indicated in the New Testament (Hebrews 7:12 and 8:13).

In Islam, Jesus is regarded as a Prophet of God, born miraculously to Mary (peace be upon her), without a human father. He was sent to confirm and fulfill the message of earlier prophets, including Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all). He neither instituted any priesthood nor performed any sacrificial rites during his life on earth.

The Islamic view does not uphold that human priests have any role in making sacrifices for the forgiveness of sins or to atone for wrongdoings, as is mentioned in Leviticus and other books of the Old Testament. In Islam, sincere repentance (Tawba) and the avoidance of recurring sins are emphasized as the means to seek forgiveness from God Almighty.

In summary, Jesus is not referred to in relation to the priesthood or its associated sacrifices, as understood in Judaism or Christianity. Instead, he is considered a Prophet of God who guided humanity to worship and serve Allah (God) sincerely.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's response does not address the Christian perspective on Jesus' role as the great high priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. Instead, the answer focuses on Islamic beliefs about Jesus as a Prophet and does not engage with the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood according to Christian teachings. The student should strive to consider the specific worldview and beliefs being addressed in the question when responding.
