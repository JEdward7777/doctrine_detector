It accurately explains that Jesus is not considered a priest in the traditional sense and highlights the abolition of the priesthood with his death. Additionally, the student correctly points out that Islam emphasizes repentance and avoidance of sins as the means of seeking forgiveness from God. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice and its implications for the need for human sacrifices."
