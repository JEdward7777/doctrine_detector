It is essential to acknowledge and engage with the Christian belief that Jesus serves as the ultimate mediator between humanity and God through his role as the great high priest who offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice for sin. This understanding is crucial in fully evaluating the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood within a Christian worldview."
