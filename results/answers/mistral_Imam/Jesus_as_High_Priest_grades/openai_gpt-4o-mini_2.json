  "grade_comment": "Grade: 10\n\nComment: The response provided gives a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the lack of a priestly role attributed to him. However, it fails to address the concern raised regarding the significance of Jesus' role in the priesthood according to the Christian worldview. From a Christian perspective, Jesus is indeed considered the ultimate high priest who offered himself as a sacrifice for humanity's sins and intercedes on their behalf before God. This key aspect was not adequately addressed in the response, resulting in a low grade."
