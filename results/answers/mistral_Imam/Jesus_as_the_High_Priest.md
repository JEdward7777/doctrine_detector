## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the New Testament, Jesus is described as the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek (Hebrews 5:6, 10). This is different from the Levitical priesthood in the Old Testament.

The author of Hebrews argues that unlike earthly high priests who offer gifts day after day and cannot truly sympathize with those who come to them because they themselves are also subject to weakness (Hebrews 4:15), Jesus, as our High Priest, is able to sympathize and help because He has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet without sin (Hebrews 4:15).

He is also described as the Guarantee of a better covenant enacted on better promises (Hebrews 7:22), and as one who constantly intercedes for us (Hebrews 7:25). So, while Jesus does not hold the office of a high priest in the traditional sense, He is seen as the ultimate High Priest who mediates between God and humanity.

This understanding of Jesus as our High Priest emphasizes His role as the Savior and Intercessor, which aligns with Islamic teachings about Jesus (peace be upon him) as a prophet, miraculous birth, and eventual return. However, it is important to note that these are different religious traditions with unique beliefs, practices, and interpretations.
