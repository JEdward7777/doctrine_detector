The references to Hebrews are accurate and supportive of the explanation. However, deducting points for the inclusion of the comparison to Islamic teachings on Jesus, as it is not directly relevant to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the High Priest. Additionally, the response could further explore the significance of Jesus' High Priestly role in the context of Christian salvation theology."
