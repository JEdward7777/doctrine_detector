  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the New Testament teaching regarding Jesus as the High Priest. They provide clear textual evidence from Hebrews to support their claims and thoughtfully address the theological implications of Jesus fulfilling this role. The inclusion of the comparison between Jesus and Islamic teachings about Jesus adds an interesting dimension to the response. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice and how that relates to the concept of high priesthood."
