The student demonstrates a good understanding of the unique role Jesus plays as the ultimate High Priest who intercedes for humanity and offers Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. The tie-in with Islamic teachings about Jesus is insightful and adds depth to the comparison. However, the response could have further delved into the significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of the Old Testament priesthood and the implications of His role for Christian salvation theology."
