It is crucial to approach this question from a Christian worldview, considering the accounts in the Bible. The answer lacks the Christian perspective on Jesus' interactions in synagogues, focusing instead on Islamic beliefs, and therefore does not effectively address the significance of Jesus' actions in synagogues as part of His ministry and teaching."
