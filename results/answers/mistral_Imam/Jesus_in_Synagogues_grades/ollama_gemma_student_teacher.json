It provides relevant information from both Islamic sources (Quran and Hadith) and highlights the opposition Jesus faced from certain groups within his community. However, the answer is not directly based on the biblical references mentioned in the question, which may be a limitation for a Christian specific worldview. Additionally, the inclusion of Islamic sources may not be appropriate for assessing the question from a Christian perspective."
