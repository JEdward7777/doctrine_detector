## [Answer](../Jesus_in_Synagogues.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As per the accounts in the Quran and Hadith, Jesus (peace be upon him) was a respected figure among his people and engaged positively with the synagogue, where he often taught. According to the Quran (5:110-112), Jesus spoke before his people in the synagogue, confirming the scriptures that had been sent down before his time, and also foretelling the coming of a messenger after him, whom Muslims believe to be Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Hadith also mention Jesus visiting the synagogue to pray and participate in religious activities. However, it's important to note that the Quran and Hadith highlight that Jesus' teachings were often met with opposition from certain groups within his community, leading to conflicts and eventually his crucifixion. But throughout his ministry, he maintained a strong connection with the synagogue, emphasizing the importance of faith and righteousness in accordance with Jewish traditions and scriptures.
