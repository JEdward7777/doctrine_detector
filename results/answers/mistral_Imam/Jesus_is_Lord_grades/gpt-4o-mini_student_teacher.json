However, the student did not address the specific concern provided, which is the need to differentiate between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. The response focused more on the difference between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus rather than directly addressing the concern raised. The student should have provided a clearer explanation using a Christian worldview on how to communicate the phrase \"Jesus is Lord\" in a context where political leaders are also called 'lord'."
