  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response accurately addresses the concern about clarity by explaining that \"Jesus is Lord\" signifies His divine authority and supremacy over all creation, distinct from human rulers. The writer also provides a nuanced understanding of Jesus' role in Islam, highlighting his position as a prophet and messenger of Allah.\n\nThe only area for improvement is that the response could have been even more explicit in emphasizing the distinction between Jesus' divine lordship and earthly titles. While it's implied through the explanation, it might be helpful to state it more directly to fully address the concern.\n\nOverall, however, this response demonstrates a thoughtful and sensitive approach to addressing the issue, and its clarity and nuance are commendable."
