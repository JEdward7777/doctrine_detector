However, it could have more directly emphasized the Christian understanding of \"Jesus is Lord\" as signifying His divine authority and supremacy over all creation. It effectively navigates the sensitivity of the issue and cultural contexts, but could have been more explicit in presenting the Christian viewpoint within an Islamic framework."
