## Question [Jesus is the Son of God](../../questions/Jesus_is_the_Son_of_God.md)
how do I translate Jesus is the Son of God into a Muslim context

## Target answer from notes
Translate "Jesus is the Son of God" by maintaining the original terminology and providing clear teaching and context to explain its meaning.

## Concern to grade by
While minimizing offense is important, it is also important to ensure that the translated text is Biblically accurate and explains the meaning of the original text in the most appropriate way.

## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, the belief that Jesus (peace be upon him) is the son of God is not accurate according to Islamic teachings. The Quran states that Allah has no offspring (Surah Al-An'am 17:111). Instead, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) is a prophet sent by Allah and was born miraculously through the virgin Mary (Maryam in Arabic) without a father. This event is known as "al-Mi'raj Isa" or "the Ascension of Isa."

So, when translating the phrase "Jesus is the Son of God" into a Muslim context, it would be more accurate to say that Jesus (peace be upon him) is a prophet and messenger of Allah. This statement reflects Islamic beliefs about Jesus' status in Islam while avoiding any language or ideas that may not align with our religious tenets.
