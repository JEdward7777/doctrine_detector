  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student correctly emphasizes Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus as a prophet and messenger of Allah, which aligns with Muslim teachings. However, while attempting to minimize offense, the student deviates from the specific word-for-word translation provided by the teacher. To improve, the response could have maintained the original terminology \"Jesus is the Son of God\" and then provided clear teaching and context to explain its meaning in a respectful and accurate manner within the Muslim context."
