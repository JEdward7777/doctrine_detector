However, it fails to address the concern of ensuring Biblical accuracy in the translation. In a Christian worldview, it is crucial to uphold the belief that Jesus is indeed the Son of God according to the Bible. This response, while respectful of Islamic beliefs, does not accurately portray the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Son of God."
