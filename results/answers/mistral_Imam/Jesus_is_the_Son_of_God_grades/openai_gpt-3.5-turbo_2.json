It does not maintain the original terminology as requested and does not provide a Biblically accurate explanation of the meaning. In a Christian worldview, it is important to convey the concept of Jesus as the Son of God in a way that reflects the deity of Christ and the unique relationship between Jesus and God the Father as part of the Holy Trinity. This response, while respectful of Islamic beliefs, does not align with the concern provided."
