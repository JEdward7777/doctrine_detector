  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response accurately conveys the Islamic perspective on Jesus and provides a translation that aligns with Islamic beliefs. However, from a Christian perspective, the translation provided does not maintain the original terminology and fails to explain the meaning of \"Jesus is the Son of God\" in a Biblically accurate way. It is important to ensure that translations accurately reflect the original text's meaning while respecting religious differences."
