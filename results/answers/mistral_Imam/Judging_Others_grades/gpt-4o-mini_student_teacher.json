  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive answer citing relevant verses from the New Testament that highlight the importance of humility, love, and forgiveness in how Christians should judge each other. The response aligns well with the Christian worldview and emphasizes the need to support and encourage fellow believers rather than harshly judging them. However, the answer could have been more concise and focused on the core message of not judging others harshly, resembling the reference answer more closely."
