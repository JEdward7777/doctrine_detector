  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively references relevant Bible passages that align with the Christian principle of not judging others harshly and instead offering support and encouragement within the Christian community. The use of specific verses from the New Testament demonstrates a solid understanding of the Christian worldview on this topic. The response could be strengthened by including a broader range of verses or exploring examples of Christ's interactions with others in the Gospels to illustrate how to emulate Christ-like behavior in relationships."
