It effectively references relevant passages from the New Testament, emphasizing the importance of humility, love, and support rather than judgment or condemnation. The only minor improvement could be expanding on how supporting each other's growth in faith ties into the concept of not judging others harshly, but overall, the response aligns well with a Christian worldview. Great job!"
