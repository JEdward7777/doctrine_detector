However, it is crucial to mention that the Christian view of judgment day is centered on faith in Jesus Christ as the ultimate criteria for salvation, not solely based on good deeds as implied in the answer given. The emphasis on works alone could be misleading and misrepresent the core Christian belief in salvation by grace through faith. Additionally, the response should have focused more on the biblical perspective rather than comparing it to Islamic beliefs, as the question specifically asked for the biblical view."
