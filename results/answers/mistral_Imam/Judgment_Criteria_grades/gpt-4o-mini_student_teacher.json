  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the biblical perspective on the Day of Judgment, focusing on how individuals will be judged based on their actions towards others. However, the student should have framed the answer explicitly within a Christian worldview, rather than discussing similarities with Islam. Additionally, the answer could have been more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer provided by the teacher. There is a good understanding of the topic, but the response lacked a strong Christian-specific focus."
