## [Answer](../Judgment_Criteria.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or perspectives. However, I can share with you some common understandings within Islam about the Day of Judgment based on the Quran and Hadith, which are our primary sources. For the question about the Biblical perspective, I will attempt to provide a summary of what is generally understood from Christian texts, primarily the Bible.

According to the Bible (Matthew 25:31-46), individuals will be judged on the Day of Judgment based on how they treated others, particularly those in need or suffering. Jesus describes this day as a time when nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people into two groups â€“ sheep (the righteous) and goats (the unrighteous).

The righteous (sheep) are described as having helped the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, giving them food, drink, shelter, and visiting them when they were sick or in prison. In contrast, the unrighteous (goats) neglected to help those in need and are sent away into eternal punishment.

In both Islam and Christianity, there is a belief that good deeds will be rewarded and bad deeds will be punished on the Day of Judgment. However, it's important to note that interpretations can vary significantly among individuals and denominations within each religion.
