## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, as we don't have the concept of "Day of Yahweh" or "Day of the Lord" directly since these terms originate from the Judeo-Christian context, we instead focus on the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiy훮mah) which is a significant event in our belief system.

The Day of Judgment is mentioned extensively in the Qur'an and Hadith, where it is described as an occurrence that will bring about the end times and mark the ultimate judgment of humanity by Allah (swt). According to Islamic teachings, this day will not be like any other day. On this day, all souls will be resurrected, and every person's deeds will be weighed in a balance of justice to determine their fate in the hereafter.

Although we don't have specific events associated with the "Day of Yahweh" or "Day of the Lord," we believe that on the Day of Judgment, there will be numerous significant signs and occurrences such as the emergence of Dajjal (Antichrist), Gog and Magog being let loose, the descent of Isa (Jesus) ibn Maryam (as) to earth, the appearance of the Beast of the Earth, the emergence of the smoke or smokeless fire from Ya'j큰j and M훮j큰j (Gog and Magog), among others.

It is important to note that these events are believed to be precursors to the Day of Judgment and their exact timings are not known, but they serve as a reminder for Muslims to always strive for righteousness and stay vigilant in their faith.
