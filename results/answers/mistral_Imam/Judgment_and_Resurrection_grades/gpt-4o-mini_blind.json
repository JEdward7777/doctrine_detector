However, the answer could have been improved by explicitly addressing the question about the \"Day of Yahweh\" or \"Day of the Lord\" within the context of Islamic beliefs, rather than solely focusing on the Islamic concept of the Day of Judgment. Additionally, the reference to Dajjal (Antichrist) and Gog and Magog aligns more closely with eschatological beliefs in Christian and Jewish traditions rather than Islamic beliefs."
