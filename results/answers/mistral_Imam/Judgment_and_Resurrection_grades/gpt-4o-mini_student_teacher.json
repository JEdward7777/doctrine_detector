  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides valuable insights into the Islamic perspective on the Day of Judgment (Yawm al-Qiy\u0101mah) and highlights significant events in Islamic eschatology. However, the response does not directly address the Christian concept of the 'day of Yahweh' or 'day of the Lord.' To improve the grade, the student should draw connections between the Christian understanding of this day and the events associated with it, as outlined in the reference answer."
