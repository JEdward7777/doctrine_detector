However, it falls short in fully addressing the specific aspects mentioned in the answer about Christian eschatology (judgment of sinners, resurrection, and establishment of God's rule). The response primarily focuses on the Islamic tradition and does not directly address these key elements. While the response mentions the concept of judgment and resurrection, it does not explicitly link these events to the \"Day of Yahweh\" or \"Day of the Lord.\" To better align with the concern, the response could have more intentionally connected Islamic eschatological concepts to Christian eschatology."
