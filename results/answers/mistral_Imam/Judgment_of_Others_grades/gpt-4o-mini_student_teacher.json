  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and well-articulated response incorporating teachings from both Islamic and Christian traditions. However, the student did not directly address the concern provided, which emphasized the importance of avoiding hypocrisy and maintaining a strong Christian witness. The answer could have been strengthened by focusing solely on Christian teachings and emphasizing the impact of hypocrisy on one's Christian witness."
