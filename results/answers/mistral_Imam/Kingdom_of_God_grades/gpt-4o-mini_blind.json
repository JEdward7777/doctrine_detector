However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the biblical understanding of the term \"Kingdom of God\" as the rule and reign of God in the hearts of believers and ultimately in the future establishment of His kingdom on earth. The suggested rephrasings lack a clear connection to the biblical concept of the Kingdom of God and may risk diluting or distorting its meaning. A more doctrinally accurate response would have focused on maintaining the biblical essence of the term while explaining it in a culturally relevant way."
