However, from a Christian worldview perspective, the concern is about potentially losing the depth and biblical context of the term by rephrasing it. The reference answer highlights the importance of retaining the term 'Kingdom of God' and providing explanations about its spiritual and eschatological significance, which aligns more closely with a Christian-specific perspective. The student's response, while insightful in its inclusivity, does not fully address the concern raised in the context of maintaining the theological integrity of the term 'Kingdom of God.'"
