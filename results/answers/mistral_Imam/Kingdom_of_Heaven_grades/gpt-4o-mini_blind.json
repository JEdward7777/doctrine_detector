The explanation lacks depth in connecting the term to Jesus' teachings and its theological implications within Christianity. The focus on Islamic beliefs, while informative, detracts from the original question and does not fully address why the term 'heaven' is important in the phrase 'Kingdom of Heaven' in the context of the Book of Matthew."
