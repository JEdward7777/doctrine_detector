The explanation provided shows insight into the significance of terminology in the gospels. The integration of Islamic perspective adds a valuable comparative element. However, a Christian-specific worldview would have benefited from a deeper exploration of the theological implications unique to the Christian understanding of the \"kingdom of heaven\" as portrayed in the Book of Matthew."
