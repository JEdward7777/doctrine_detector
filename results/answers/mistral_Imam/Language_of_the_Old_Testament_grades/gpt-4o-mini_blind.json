  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComments: The response correctly identifies that the vast majority of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic. The mention of different religious communities and their canons is informative. However, there is a slight oversight in not explicitly mentioning the divine inspiration of the Old Testament within the Christian worldview. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to include a brief explanation of the significance of the Old Testament within Christianity as the foundational scripture leading to the New Testament. Overall, a solid answer with minor theological areas for improvement."
