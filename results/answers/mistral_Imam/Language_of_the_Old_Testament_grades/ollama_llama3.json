  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern that this knowledge is essential for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context. It mentions the original language of the Old Testament (Hebrew) which is crucial information. However, it does not fully address the concern as it only provides a limited amount of information about the languages used in the Old Testament. Additionally, the response could be strengthened by discussing how knowing the original language can help with understanding the context and meaning of the Scriptures.\n\nThe response also mentions that some parts were written in Aramaic which is accurate but not directly related to the concern at hand."
