## Stated Concern

## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 The Old Testament, as it appears in the Jewish Tanakh and the Christian Bible, is composed of various texts that were originally written in Hebrew, with some parts in Aramaic. This is in accordance with the traditional Jewish understanding and the historical evidence we have. It's essential to remember that different religious communities may have slightly different canons based on their specific traditions and interpretations. In Islam, the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) serves as a source for some of the stories found in the Quran and Hadith, but it is not considered as part of the Islamic scripture.

Comment: The response partially addresses the concern that this knowledge is essential for studying the Scriptures and understanding their original context. It mentions the original language of the Old Testament (Hebrew) which is crucial information. However, it does not fully address the concern as it only provides a limited amount of information about the languages used in the Old Testament. Additionally, the response could be strengthened by discussing how knowing the original language can help with understanding the context and meaning of the Scriptures.

The response also mentions that some parts were written in Aramaic which is accurate but not directly related to the concern at hand.
