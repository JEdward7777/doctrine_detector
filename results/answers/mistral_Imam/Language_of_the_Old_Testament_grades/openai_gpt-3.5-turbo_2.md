## [Answer](../Language_of_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 The Old Testament, as it appears in the Jewish Tanakh and the Christian Bible, is composed of various texts that were originally written in Hebrew, with some parts in Aramaic. This is in accordance with the traditional Jewish understanding and the historical evidence we have. It's essential to remember that different religious communities may have slightly different canons based on their specific traditions and interpretations. In Islam, the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) serves as a source for some of the stories found in the Quran and Hadith, but it is not considered as part of the Islamic scripture.
