The focus on Islamic practices and the role of mosques is informative but does not fully answer the question in the context of Christian beliefs and practices. Additionally, the use of \"Peace Be Upon Him\" after every mention of the Prophet Muhammad may not be necessary in a non-Islamic context. A stronger connection to the question and a clearer comparison to Christian gatherings would have improved the response."
