  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50 \n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of how Muslims meet in mosques and the importance of community engagement and brotherhood, which is commendable. However, the response did not directly address the concern of fostering local fellowship among believers in a city, as the teacher's reference answer did. The student also focused more on the historical and structural aspects of mosques in Islam rather than specifically addressing the manner in which believers typically meet to encourage fellowship."
