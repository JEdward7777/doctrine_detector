While the response does not directly address believers meeting in homes as suggested in the given answer, it effectively highlights the concept of local fellowship and communal gatherings within the Islamic tradition. The explanation is thorough and aligned with encouraging fellowship among believers, although a more direct reference to believers meeting in homes could have further enhanced the response."
