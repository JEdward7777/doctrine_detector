  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student attempted to address the concern by providing a general interpretation of Romans 8:23 from a Christian perspective, despite acknowledging their Islamic background. However, the student's response lacks depth and fails to fully engage with the specific concern of understanding the hope and future aspect of being adopted into God's family. There is room for improvement in connecting the verse to the implications for believers and emphasizing the significance of awaiting the completion of adoption as God's children."
