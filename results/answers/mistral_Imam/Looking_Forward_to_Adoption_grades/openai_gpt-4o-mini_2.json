The mention of receiving glorified bodies and experiencing their identity in Christ aligns well with the concern of understanding the hope and future aspect of being adopted into God's family. The response could have further elaborated on the spiritual implications and significance of this adoption, but overall, it effectively addresses the concern from a Christian worldview."
