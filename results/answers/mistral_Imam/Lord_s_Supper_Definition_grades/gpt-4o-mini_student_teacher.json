However, the answer is compromised by the introduction of personal beliefs and practices from a Muslim context, which is not relevant to the question about Christian beliefs. The response would have been stronger if it focused solely on the Christian perspective and directly addressed the significance of the Lord's Supper as the Passover meal where Jesus presented his body and blood as a sacrifice for sin."
