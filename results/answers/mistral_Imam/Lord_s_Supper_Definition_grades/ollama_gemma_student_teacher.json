  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately describes the significance of the Lord's Supper as a commemoration of the Last Supper and its connection to Jesus' sacrifice and salvation. However, it does not specifically address the Christian perspective on the event, which is the focus of the concern. The inclusion of a clarification regarding the student's non-Christian perspective is also relevant."
