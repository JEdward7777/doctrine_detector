However, it lacks depth in explaining the broader theological and spiritual implications of the Lord's Supper, such as the concept of communion with Christ and fellow believers, the remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice, and the anticipation of his return. More emphasis on these aspects would enhance the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
