  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive comparison between Islamic and Biblical perspectives on forgiveness, emphasizing its importance in demonstrating love and compassion towards others. However, the response lacks a direct link to the concern of encouraging forgiveness as a reflection of God's love in daily interactions, which is the main focus of the question. The student could have strengthened their answer by directly addressing how forgiveness reflects God's unconditional love and is vital for maintaining healthy relationships, as stated in the reference answer provided by the teacher."
