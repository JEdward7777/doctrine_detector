  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and well-articulated response that aligns with the Christian perspective on the significance of marriage. The student effectively references biblical verses to support their points and emphasizes the importance of mutual love, respect, and commitment in marriage. However, the mention of Islamic teachings at the end of the response, while acknowledging similarities, detracts slightly from the focus on promoting strong, Christ-centered marriages according to the specified concern."
