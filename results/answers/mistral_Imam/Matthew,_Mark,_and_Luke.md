## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, the names of the twelve apostles or disciples can be found in three main books: Matthew (10:2-4; 13:17; 16:21; 19:28; 20:20; 26:20; 27:3-5, 55-56), Mark (3:13-19; 6:7-8; 14:10, 17, 20) and Luke (6:13-16; 9:10). In these passages, the disciples are listed as follows:

1. Simon Peter (Peter or Cephas in Aramaic) - brother of Andrew
2. Andrew - brother of Simon Peter
3. James, son of Zebedee (James the Greater)
4. John (son of Zebedee) - brother of James the Greater
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew (or Nathanael)
7. Thomas
8. Matthew (Levi)
9. James, son of Alphaeus
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed Jesus and was replaced by Matthias)
12. Judas Thaddaeus (or Lebbaeus or Jude, son of James), brother of James the Less.

In Muslim tradition, while Muslims believe in many of the prophets and messengers mentioned in the Bible, they do not accept the books beyond the Torah as divinely revealed scriptures, so it is important to note that this information comes from a Christian perspective within the context of your question.
