The inclusion of additional information about Muslim beliefs demonstrates an understanding of the cultural and religious context. However, it could have been even stronger if it had included the book of Acts, where Matthias is specifically chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve. Overall, a well-written and informative response."
