  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and accurate answer by listing the names of the twelve disciples along with the corresponding Bible verses from the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. However, the additional information about Muslim tradition, while informative, is not directly relevant to the question at hand, which focused specifically on the books of the Bible where the names of the disciples are listed. Overall, a solid response demonstrating knowledge of the Gospel accounts and their teachings."
