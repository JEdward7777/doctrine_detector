  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThis response meets the minimum requirement by correctly stating that the names of the twelve disciples can be found in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Additionally, it provides specific biblical references to support its claim, which shows an effort to engage with the Gospel accounts and their teachings.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response could have been more comprehensive. For instance, it would have been helpful to provide a brief description of each disciple or some insight into their significance in Christian theology. The response also spends a disproportionate amount of time discussing Muslim tradition, which is not directly relevant to the original question.\n\nOverall, while this response demonstrates some familiarity with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, it could have been more detailed and focused on the specific topic at hand."
