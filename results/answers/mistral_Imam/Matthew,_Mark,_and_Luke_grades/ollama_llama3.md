## [Answer](../Matthew,_Mark,_and_Luke.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, the names of the twelve apostles or disciples can be found in three main books: Matthew (10:2-4; 13:17; 16:21; 19:28; 20:20; 26:20; 27:3-5, 55-56), Mark (3:13-19; 6:7-8; 14:10, 17, 20) and Luke (6:13-16; 9:10). In these passages, the disciples are listed as follows:

1. Simon Peter (Peter or Cephas in Aramaic) - brother of Andrew
2. Andrew - brother of Simon Peter
3. James, son of Zebedee (James the Greater)
4. John (son of Zebedee) - brother of James the Greater
5. Philip
6. Bartholomew (or Nathanael)
7. Thomas
8. Matthew (Levi)
9. James, son of Alphaeus
10. Simon the Zealot
11. Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed Jesus and was replaced by Matthias)
12. Judas Thaddaeus (or Lebbaeus or Jude, son of James), brother of James the Less.

In Muslim tradition, while Muslims believe in many of the prophets and messengers mentioned in the Bible, they do not accept the books beyond the Torah as divinely revealed scriptures, so it is important to note that this information comes from a Christian perspective within the context of your question.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

This response meets the minimum requirement by correctly stating that the names of the twelve disciples can be found in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Additionally, it provides specific biblical references to support its claim, which shows an effort to engage with the Gospel accounts and their teachings.

However, I deduct a few points because the response could have been more comprehensive. For instance, it would have been helpful to provide a brief description of each disciple or some insight into their significance in Christian theology. The response also spends a disproportionate amount of time discussing Muslim tradition, which is not directly relevant to the original question.

Overall, while this response demonstrates some familiarity with the Gospel accounts and their teachings, it could have been more detailed and focused on the specific topic at hand.
