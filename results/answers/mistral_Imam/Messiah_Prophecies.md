## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim scholar, I would like to share with you some of the prophecies about the Messiah found in the Jewish scriptures (Old Testament) and discuss how Jesus, as many Christians believe, fulfilled these prophecies.

1. The Prophecy of a Virgin Birth (Isaiah 7:14): This prophecy refers to a virgin who will give birth to a son named Immanuel, which means "God with us." In Christian theology, Jesus was born from the Virgin Mary, making this prophecy relevant to him.

2. The Prophecy of His Lineage (Genesis 49:10): This passage speaks about the scepter not departing from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh comes. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, which is in the tribe of Judah, as prophesied in Micah 5:2.

3. The Prophecy of His Kingdom (Isaiah 9:6-7): This prophecy speaks about a ruler who will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, and his government will be forever. Christians believe that Jesus fulfills this prophecy as he is described in the Gospels with these characteristics and established his kingdom in heaven.

4. The Prophecy of His Suffering (Isaiah 53): This passage contains a detailed description of the Messiah's suffering, including being pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities. Christians believe that Jesus' crucifixion and death fulfill this prophecy.

5. The Prophecy of His Resurrection (Psalm 16:10): This passage speaks about the Messiah not seeing decay and being exalted to dwell in the highest heights, which Christians interpret as referring to Jesus' resurrection from the dead and ascension into heaven.

In Islamic belief, Muslims recognize the prophecies of Isa (Jesus) but believe that he did not die on the cross, was not crucified, and did not fulfill these specific prophecies in a manner that aligns with Christian theology. Instead, Muslims hold that Jesus will return to earth at the end of times as one of the signs of Qiyamah (Resurrection).
