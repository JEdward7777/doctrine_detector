However, the student's perspective as a Muslim scholar, while informative, may hinder the depth of understanding and appreciation for the significance of these prophecies in strengthening faith in Jesus as the Messiah. The answer would have been stronger if it solely focused on the Christian interpretation and fulfillment of these prophecies by Jesus."
