However, the response could have provided more depth by including additional prophecies and their fulfillment by Jesus, such as his suffering, resurrection, and kingdom establishment. By delving deeper into these prophecies, the significance of Jesus as the Messiah could have been further emphasized, thus strengthening faith in Him."
