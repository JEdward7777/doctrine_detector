However, the student did not clearly differentiate Jesus' unique role as the Messiah in Christianity, nor did they reference Old Testament prophecies that Jesus fulfilled. Encouraging further emphasis on Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of Messianic prophecies in the Bible would strengthen their response from a Christian worldview perspective."
