It acknowledges the uniqueness of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the savior. The response could have further emphasized the divinity of Jesus as the Son of God, which is a key aspect that sets Him apart from other religious savior figures. Clarifying this would have strengthened the differentiation between Jesus' role and the Islamic concept of the Messiah."
