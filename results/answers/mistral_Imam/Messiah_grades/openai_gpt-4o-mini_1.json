The explanation is well-articulated and respectful of both traditions. However, it could be enhanced by explicitly tying in the importance of teaching about Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His unique role as the savior, in order to clearly differentiate His role from other religious savior figures while staying true to scripture."
