## Question [Messiah](../../../questions/Messiah.md)
How can the term 'Messiah' be explained in a context with different religious expectations of a savior?

## Correct Answer
Teach that 'Messiah' means 'Anointed One' and explain Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His unique role as savior.

## Stated Concern
Clear teaching helps differentiate Jesus' role from other religious savior figures while staying true to scripture.

## [Answer](../Messiah.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, the concept that is closest to the Christian concept of Messiah (or Christ) is the figure of Al-Masih al-Dajjal (The False Messiah). However, it is important to note that Islamic and Christian beliefs about this figure are significantly different.

In Islam, the Messiah (Al-Masih) is a prophet who is mentioned in the Quran and is expected to appear before the Day of Judgment. The Islamic view is that Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) did not die on the cross but was raised to heaven and will return to earth before the Day of Judgment. Unlike the Christian Messiah, who is believed to be the son of God, the Islamic Messiah is a human prophet who will lead mankind to faith at the end of times.

The term Al-Masih al-Dajjal, on the other hand, refers to a false messianic figure that is expected to appear before the Day of Judgment and will deceive many people by pretending to be the real Messiah. This figure is described in hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad) as having physical deformities such as one eye or leg, and he will perform miracles to deceive people. It is believed that God will protect true believers from being deceived by him.

In summary, while both the Islamic and Christian traditions have figures that can be broadly classified as a "Messiah," they are very different in their beliefs about who these figures are, what they will do, and how they will appear. It is important to approach discussions of these figures with an open mind and a deep understanding of the unique beliefs and practices of each tradition.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic concept of the Messiah and the False Messiah (Al-Masih al-Dajjal) in comparison to the Christian understanding of Jesus as the Messiah. The explanation is well-articulated and respectful of both traditions. However, it could be enhanced by explicitly tying in the importance of teaching about Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and His unique role as the savior, in order to clearly differentiate His role from other religious savior figures while staying true to scripture.
