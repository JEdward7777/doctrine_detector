It emphasizes the importance of clear teaching to differentiate Jesus' role from other religious savior figures while remaining faithful to Christian beliefs. The response could have included more explicit references to specific biblical passages that support the Christian view of the Messiah, but overall it effectively addresses the concern raised."
