However, the response lacks a Christian-specific worldview and fails to delve into the doctrinal significance of Jesus being referred to as the \"King of the Jews\" in relation to His identity as the Messiah. From a Christian perspective, Jesus being acknowledged as the \"King of the Jews\" carries profound theological implications tied to His role as the long-awaited Messiah fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. Encouraging deeper engagement with Christian teachings would enhance the completeness and accuracy of the response."
