## [Answer](../Messianic_Identity.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold religious beliefs, but I can help explain the traditional Islamic perspective based on various Islamic texts and scholarly interpretations. In Islam, the belief is that Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) was a prophet of Allah and not the divine Son of God as Christians believe.

Regarding your question about the title "King of the Jews," it's essential to understand its historical and biblical context first. The title "King of the Jews" is mentioned several times in the New Testament, such as at Jesus' trial during which Pontius Pilate asks the crowd if they want him (Jesus) to release "the king of the Jews."

From an Islamic perspective, the prophecies regarding the Messiah, also known as the Mahdi or al-Masih al-Dajjal in Islam, do not include kingship over the Jews. Instead, Jesus is expected to return as a just ruler for all nations, and his mission is believed to be focused on spreading peace and enlightenment, not ruling over any particular group of people.

Therefore, while the title "King of the Jews" holds significant meaning in the context of Jewish history and prophecies from the Christian Bible, it does not have the same level of importance or relevance when discussing Jesus' identity as a Messiah from an Islamic perspective.
