However, the inclusion of comparisons between Christian and Muslim interpretations deviates from the focus on a Christian-specific worldview. The answer would benefit from a more in-depth exploration of biblical teachings on ministry and a clearer emphasis on Jesus Christ as the ultimate example of servant leadership. Additionally, connecting the concept of ministry to theological principles and biblical passages would strengthen the response."
