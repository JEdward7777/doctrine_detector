  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and informative answer on the biblical understanding of ministry, emphasizing the importance of serving God and others in various capacities. However, the student veered off-topic by discussing the differences between Muslim and Christian interpretations of service and leadership, which was not the focus of the question. The answer could have been improved by staying focused on the biblical definition of ministry and excluding extraneous information."
