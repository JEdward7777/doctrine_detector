  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the biblical concept of ministry by delving into the roles and characteristics of ministers as outlined in the Bible. The student effectively connects the definition of ministry to its significance in serving God and others. The response also acknowledges the importance of understanding the biblical definition of ministry for effective service in the church and community. However, the mention of differences between Christian and Muslim interpretations, while interesting, slightly detracts from focusing solely on the Christian worldview as requested."
