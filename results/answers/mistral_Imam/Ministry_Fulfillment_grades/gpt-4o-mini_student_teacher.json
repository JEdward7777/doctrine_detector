  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a misunderstanding of the Christian perspective on fulfilling one's ministry. The response primarily focuses on comparing Islamic and Christian views on serving others without adequately addressing the Christian concept of ministry being tied to fulfilling God's calling in one's life. There is a lack of depth in the explanation of Christian beliefs and practices regarding ministry. The student could benefit from delving deeper into Christian teachings on fulfilling one's ministry to better address the concern provided."
