The student effectively connected the concept of miracles to the authenticity of prophethood and the message they bring. However, the answer could have been strengthened by more directly addressing how miracles in Islam lead to belief in God specifically, as opposed to solely focusing on the authenticity of the prophet. Additionally, more emphasis on the ultimate purpose of miracles as guiding people to faith in the One true God, Allah, would have enhanced the overall theological depth of the response."
