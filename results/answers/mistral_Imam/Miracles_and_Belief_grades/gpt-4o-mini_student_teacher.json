  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-written response from an Islamic perspective, discussing the role of miracles in confirming the truthfulness of prophets sent by Allah. While the answer effectively explains the significance of miracles in Islam, it does not directly address the Christian perspective on how miracles lead to belief in God. To enhance the grade, the student could have incorporated more aspects specific to Christian beliefs about miracles and their role in leading others to faith."
