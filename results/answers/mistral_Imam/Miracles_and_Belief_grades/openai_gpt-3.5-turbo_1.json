It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how miracles lead to belief in God and strengthen faith. The integration of a Christian worldview could have been improved by contrasting Islamic beliefs with the Christian perspective on miracles and how they serve to point people towards Jesus Christ as the ultimate revelation of God's power and truth."
