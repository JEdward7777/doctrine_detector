## [Answer](../Miracles_and_Belief.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, miracles serve as proof or evidence of the truthfulness of a prophet sent by Allah (God). This concept is based on the Quranic verse: "And We did not send any messenger except with the language of his people, and we sent Messengers with clear evidences." (Quran 12:109)

Miracles, in Islam, are not considered as extraordinary events for their own sake but rather as signs that authenticate the message a prophet brings. They demonstrate the truth of their claim to be a messenger of Allah and the veracity of their teachings.

For instance, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) did not perform miracles in the manner commonly associated with traditional tales about other religious figures. Instead, his miracles took the form of the Quran itself â€“ a revelation that was miraculous in its eloquence, beauty, and consistency over a period of 23 years. It is this miracle, along with the fulfillment of prophecies concerning the Prophet's life, that serves as evidence for Muslims that he was truly sent by Allah.

Miracles, thus, function as signs that lead to belief in God by providing compelling proof of a prophet's truthfulness and the authenticity of their message. They serve to strengthen faith, encourage obedience, and confirm the oneness and omnipotence of Allah.
