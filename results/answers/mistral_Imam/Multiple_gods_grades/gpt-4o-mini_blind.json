However, it falls short in explicitly addressing how missionaries should specifically address the misconception that Christians believe in multiple gods. It also lacks emphasis on the foundational Christian doctrine of monotheism and the uniqueness of the Trinity within Christianity. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, the comparison to Islamic teachings could be misleading and potentially confuse the distinct theological differences between Islam and Christianity. More clarity and specificity on how missionaries can effectively address this misconception within a Christian framework are needed."
