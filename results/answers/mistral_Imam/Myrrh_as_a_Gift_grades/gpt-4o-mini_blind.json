  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While the response provides a perspective from Islamic beliefs, it does not align with Christian doctrine regarding the significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth. The answer does not address the Christian understanding of myrrh as a symbolic gift representing Jesus' mortality and eventual sacrifice for humanity. Therefore, the grade is lower due to the lack of doctrinal correctness in the context of the question asked."
