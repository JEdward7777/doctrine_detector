  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched answer from an Islamic perspective, explaining the significance of myrrh in the context of Prophet Isa (Jesus) according to Islamic beliefs. However, the student did not address the concern about the symbolism of gifts in relation to Jesus' purpose and mission from a Christian worldview, which was the focus of the question. The answer lacked an analysis of myrrh's representation of Jesus' future suffering and sacrificial role as the Messiah, as highlighted in the reference answer. Hence, while the response was informative, it did not fully address the Christian-specific interpretation of the significance of myrrh as one of the gifts given to Jesus at his birth."
