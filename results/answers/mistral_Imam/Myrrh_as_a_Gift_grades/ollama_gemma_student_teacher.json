  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70/100\n\n**Comment:** \nWhile the student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the symbolic significance of the gifts given to Jesus in Islamic tradition, it does not address the Christian-specific concern related to the connection between myrrh and Jesus' suffering and death. The response lacks the theological analysis required to fully address the prompt from the Christian worldview."
