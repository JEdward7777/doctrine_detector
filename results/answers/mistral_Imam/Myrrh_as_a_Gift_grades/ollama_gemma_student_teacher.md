## [Answer](../Myrrh_as_a_Gift.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I don't attribute specific religious narratives or miracles to individuals outside the scope of Islamic belief. However, in the context of the Quran and Hadith, the story of Prophet Isa (Jesus) is mentioned, but it differs slightly from the traditional Christian narrative.

Regarding your question, myrrh (Mih) is one of the three gifts given to Prophet Isa (peace be upon him), according to the Quran (Surah Maryam 19:23-33). The other two are dates and a robe of pure silk. In Islamic tradition, these gifts symbolize respect, honor, and reverence for the birth of Prophet Isa (Jesus), not as divine but as a prophet sent by Allah to guide mankind.

Myrrh is a fragrant resin used in various religious rituals across cultures, including in Islam, where it is mentioned in Hadith as one of the ingredients for the Prophet Muhammad's (peace be upon him) Kohl, which Muslims use for eye makeup. In this context, myrrh holds significance as a valuable and aromatic substance that has spiritual connotations.

**Grade:** 70/100

**Comment:** 
While the student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the symbolic significance of the gifts given to Jesus in Islamic tradition, it does not address the Christian-specific concern related to the connection between myrrh and Jesus' suffering and death. The response lacks the theological analysis required to fully address the prompt from the Christian worldview.
