While it provides some background information about the Quranic narrative of Prophet Isa (Jesus) and the gifts given to him, including myrrh, this information is not connected to the specific symbolism of myrrh representing Jesus' future suffering and death. The response could be improved by more explicitly linking the Islamic perspective on myrrh's significance to Jesus' purpose and mission as understood within a Christian context."
