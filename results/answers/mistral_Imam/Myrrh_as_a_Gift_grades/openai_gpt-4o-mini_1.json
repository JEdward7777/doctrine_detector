However, it did not address the concern raised about understanding the symbolism of gifts given to Jesus in the Christian narrative, which is essential for appreciating his purpose and mission from a Christian worldview. Integrating a comparison or acknowledgment of differing perspectives on myrrh's symbolism in relation to Jesus' sacrifice would have enhanced the response."
