  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of the significance of myrrh in Islamic tradition and its symbolic meanings in relation to Prophet Isa (Jesus) within an Islamic worldview. However, it did not address the concern regarding how understanding the symbolism of gifts can deepen appreciation for Jesus' purpose and mission, which is important in a Christian context. To improve the grade, the response could have included a brief acknowledgment of the Christian interpretation of myrrh as symbolizing Jesus' future suffering and death, while also maintaining the Islamic perspective presented."
