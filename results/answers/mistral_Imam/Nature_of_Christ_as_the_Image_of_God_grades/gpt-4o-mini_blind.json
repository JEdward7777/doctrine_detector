  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of Jesus as the image of God in Christian belief, highlighting key aspects such as Jesus revealing God's nature, His sacrificial work, and the bridge between humanity and the Divine. The student correctly points out the differences between Christian and Muslim beliefs regarding Jesus. However, the response could have delved deeper into the concept of Jesus being the incarnate Son of God, emphasizing His divinity alongside His humanity. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to mention the theological significance of Jesus as the Second Person of the Trinity. Overall, a good overview but lacking some doctrinal depth."
