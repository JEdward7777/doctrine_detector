  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a good overview of how Jesus is described as the image of God in Christian belief, referencing relevant scriptures and highlighting the significance of this concept in revealing God's nature to humanity. However, the student's answer falls short in fully articulating Jesus' divinity and essence as God himself, which is a crucial aspect of this theological understanding from a Christian worldview. Additionally, while the comparison with Muslim beliefs about Prophet Isa adds context, it could have been more explicitly tied back to the significance within Christian belief. Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding but could deepen their explanation of Jesus as the image of God in relation to his divinity and salvific role."
