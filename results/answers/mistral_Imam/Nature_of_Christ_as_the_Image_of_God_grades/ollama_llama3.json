The response also lacks specific biblical references and fails to discuss the implications of Jesus being the image of God in relation to humanity's relationship with God. Overall, while the response does provide some theological insights, it does not fully address the concern of understanding Christ's nature in relation to God.\n\nThe provided answer is partially correct, but does not accurately convey the biblical concept of Jesus as the image of God. The response could benefit from more depth and analysis on this topic, particularly in regards to its implications for Christian theology and practice."
