However, it does not directly address the concern that Jesus is God himself and shares the same essence with God the Father. While the response correctly states Christians' veneration of Jesus as the Son of God and Messiah, it falls short in fully articulating the divinity of Jesus as part of the triune Godhead. More explicit discussion of Jesus' divinity and his unique relationship with God the Father would have strengthened the theological understanding in this context."
