However, there is a deviation from the given answer, as the response does not explicitly state that Jesus is God himself and shares the same essence with God the Father. This aspect, which emphasizes Jesus' divinity, is crucial in the Christian understanding of Christ's nature in relation to God. The response could have been strengthened by clearly articulating this doctrinal aspect."
