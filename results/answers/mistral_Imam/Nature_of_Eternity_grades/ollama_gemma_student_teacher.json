  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer accurately defines eternity within the Christian belief as everlasting, timeless existence without end. It also correctly connects the concept of eternity to the idea that God is eternal. The language used is clear and concise, and the overall understanding of the concept is well-articulated. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the different denominations' interpretations of eternity to fully address the concern raised in the prompt."
