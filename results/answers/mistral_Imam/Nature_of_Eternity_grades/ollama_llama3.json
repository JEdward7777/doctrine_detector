  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response accurately defines eternity as having no beginning or end, which aligns with the given answer. It also correctly connects eternity to heaven and hell, highlighting that souls experience eternal life with God in heaven or eternal separation from Him in hell. The mention of Christian denominations having slightly different understandings adds depth to the explanation.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger if it explicitly emphasized the significance of understanding eternity for Christians' faith and decision-making, as stated in the concern. While the definition is solid, it doesn't directly address why comprehending eternity is crucial for believers.\n\nOverall, the response provides a good foundation for understanding eternity from a Christian perspective, but could benefit from more explicit connection to the concern about its importance for Christian faith and decision-making."
