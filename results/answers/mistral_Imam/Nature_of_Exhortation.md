## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices, but I can share information based on various religious texts. In this case, I will discuss how Christians are encouraged to approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament.

In the New Testament, there is a significant emphasis on love, humility, and gentleness in all interactions, including exhortation. Here are a few examples:

1. Love: "Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins." (1 Peter 4:8) This verse emphasizes the importance of showing love to others when addressing their shortcomings or errors.

2. Humility: "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves" (Philippians 2:3). Christians are encouraged to approach exhortation with humility, recognizing that they too are imperfect and need God's grace.

3. Gentleness: "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance." (2 Peter 3:9). This verse illustrates the importance of being gentle and patient when sharing God's word with others.

4. Encouragement: "And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one anotherâ€”and all the more as you see the Day approaching." (Hebrews 10:24-25). This passage highlights the importance of encouraging one another in the faith, rather than merely focusing on correcting errors or faults.

These principles can serve as a guide for Christians when engaging in exhortation, and I hope this information is helpful. It's always important to approach religious discussions with respect, understanding, and openness to learn from one another.
