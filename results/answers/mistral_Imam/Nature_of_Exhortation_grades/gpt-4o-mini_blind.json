  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of how Christians are encouraged to approach exhortation according to the teachings of the New Testament, emphasizing love, humility, gentleness, and encouragement. The examples given are relevant and supported by appropriate Bible verses. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly mentioning the need for exhortation to be rooted in Scripture and for Christians to exhort others to align their lives with the truths of God's Word. Additionally, the student could have highlighted the importance of exhortation being done in a spirit of meekness and restoration, seeking the other person's spiritual welfare above all."
