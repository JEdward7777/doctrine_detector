It is a reminder that He is the Most Merciful (Ar-Rahman) and the Most Compassionate (Ar-Raheem), who extends forgiveness to those who turn to Him in repentance.

Secondly, it highlights God's Justice: While Jesus taught us to forgive one another, he also underscored that God is just, and He will reward good deeds and punish wrongdoings. This balance between mercy and justice is an essential aspect of the character of God the Father in Islamic teachings as well.
