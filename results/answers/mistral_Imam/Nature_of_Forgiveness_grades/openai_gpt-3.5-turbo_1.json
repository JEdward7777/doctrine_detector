The student effectively connects Jesus's emphasis on forgiveness with the attributes of God's mercy, justice, love, and wisdom. The response demonstrates a good understanding of how forgiveness reflects God's nature of grace and mercy, as well as how it relates to God's overall character. The integration of Islamic beliefs with the Christian worldview in addressing the concern is well done. Great job overall!"
