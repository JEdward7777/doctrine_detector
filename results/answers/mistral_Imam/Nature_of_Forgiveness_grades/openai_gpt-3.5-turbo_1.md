It is a reminder that He is the Most Merciful (Ar-Rahman) and the Most Compassionate (Ar-Raheem), who extends forgiveness to those who turn to Him in repentance.

Secondly, it highlights God's Justice: While Jesus taught us to forgive one another, he also underscored that God is just, and He will reward good deeds and punish wrongdoings.
