It addresses the concern by highlighting how Jesus's emphasis on forgiveness reveals God's moral and relational attributes of mercy, justice, love, and wisdom. The connections drawn between forgiveness and these attributes provide a thorough and cohesive Christian worldview perspective on the topic. Great job overall!"
