## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a learned individual in the Muslim context, I would like to clarify that the Holy Quran mentions Prophet Isa (Jesus) as a prophet of Allah, but it is important to understand the context in which he made his statements.

In John 4:24, Jesus said "God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." This statement is often interpreted by Christians to mean that God is only a spirit and not embodied or physical in any way.

However, as Muslims, we believe in the Oneness of Allah (Tawheed) and His existence beyond time and space, which transcends human understanding. In the Quran, Allah is described as having attributes of life, knowledge, will, and power, but these are symbolic descriptions meant to help us understand Him in a way that we can comprehend.

Regarding Jesus' statement, Muslims interpret it as emphasizing the importance of sincerity (Ikhlaas) and truthfulness (Siddiqah) in worshipping Allah. This means that our actions should come from a pure heart, free of hypocrisy or worldly desires. We must strive to follow the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the previous prophets, including Jesus, as best we can.

In summary, the idea that God is only a spirit should not influence our understanding of Allah's nature as described in the Quran, but rather inspire us to approach our worship with sincerity and truthfulness.
