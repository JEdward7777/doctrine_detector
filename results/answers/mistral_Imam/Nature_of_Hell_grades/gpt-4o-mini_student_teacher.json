  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer did not address the concern of understanding the severity and purpose of hell in the Christian view of judgment and salvation. Instead, they provided information from a Muslim perspective, which is not aligned with the question asked. The response lacked a Christian-specific worldview and failed to engage with the reference answer provided by the teacher. The student should focus on addressing the specific concerns raised in the question within the context of Christianity."
