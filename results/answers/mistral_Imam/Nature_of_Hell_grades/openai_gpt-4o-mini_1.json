The response should have focused more on the Christian perspective, emphasizing the eternal consequences of Hell for those who reject God's salvation through Jesus Christ. Additionally, it should have highlighted the role of Hell in the context of God's justice and holiness. The response's inclusion of a Muslim perspective, while informative, somewhat detracted from a thorough Christian worldview analysis on Hell."
