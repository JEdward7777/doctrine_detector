  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical account of manna and its miraculous nature. They correctly identify the physical description of manna as white flakes and provide an accurate reference to Exodus (16:31). Additionally, the student acknowledges the symbolic and cultural context of the manna's taste and appearance, which demonstrates an awareness of the limitations of interpreting ancient texts through modern-day sensibilities."
