Understanding the miraculous provision of God.

## [Answer](../Nature_of_Manna.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Book of Exodus (16:31), the Bible describes manna as being like coriander seed in appearance, white; and its taste is described as being like wafers made with honey. However, it's important to note that this description might be metaphorical or symbolic, as people may interpret the tastes and appearances of manna differently based on their cultural context. Manna was a mysterious substance that provided food for the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness, according to biblical accounts. It's not something commonly found today, so there is no scientific basis for discussing its actual taste or appearance. The story of manna serves as a spiritual reminder and symbolizes divine provision and guidance in difficult times.
