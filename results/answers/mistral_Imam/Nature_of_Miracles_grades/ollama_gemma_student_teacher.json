They clearly articulate the Islamic belief that miracles are evidence of prophethood rather than divinity. However, the response could benefit from further elaboration on how the miracles align with the Christian understanding of Jesus's identity as the Son of God. The conclusion could also be strengthened by explicitly connecting the miracles to Jesus's divine nature and role as the Christ."
