  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 20.\n\nThis response fundamentally misunderstands the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature, as specified by the concern. The response presents Islamic views on Jesus's miracles, which are distinct from Christian understandings, and does not engage with the original answer that Jesus is God or the Christ/Messiah. Instead, it highlights the prophetic nature of Jesus in Islam and emphasizes his special relationship with God, without acknowledging His divinity.\n\nThe comment would be: \"This response fails to address the concern about understanding the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature.
