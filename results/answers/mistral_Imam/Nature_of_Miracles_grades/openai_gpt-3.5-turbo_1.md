# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a great prophet sent by God to guide mankind. However, our beliefs regarding the miracles attributed to Jesus differ somewhat from those in some Christian traditions.

In Islam, we recognize three main miracles that Jesus performed: speaking as an infant in the cradle, healing the blind and lepers, and reviving the dead. These miracles are not seen as proof of his divinity but rather evidence of his prophethood, divine grace, and special relationship with God (Allah).

In Islamic teachings, miracles (Karamat) are extraordinary actions that confirm the truthfulness and authenticity of a prophet's message. They demonstrate the unique connection between the Prophet and God, as well as their ability to intercede on behalf of mankind before God. However, these miracles do not indicate deification or incarnation.

Therefore, in our perspective, the miracles performed by Jesus confirm his prophethood and special status among the prophets, but they do not reveal his identity as the Son of God or divine figure. Instead, we believe that he is a human messenger who was purified of all sin and chosen to receive revelation from Allah.

These beliefs are based on the teachings found in the Quran and authentic traditions (Hadith) of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muslims around the world continue to revere Jesus as one of the most important prophets in our faith, seeking guidance and inspiration from his life and teachings.

Comment: The response provided accurately presents the Islamic perspective on Jesus and his miracles, emphasizing his prophethood and special status without indicating his divinity. It aligns with Christian concerns about understanding the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature. However, the response does not align with a Christian worldview, as it does not acknowledge the belief that Jesus is God or the Messiah based on His miracles. From a Christian perspective, the importance of Jesus's miracles lies in revealing His divine nature and identity as the Son of God, which is not reflected in the Islamic beliefs presented in the response.
