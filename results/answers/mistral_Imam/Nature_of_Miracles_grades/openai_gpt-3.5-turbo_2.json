The explanation given emphasizes that the miracles of Jesus in Islamic tradition confirm his prophethood and special relationship with God, rather than affirming his divine nature as the Son of God or as God incarnate. Hence, from a Christian worldview that values the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divinity, this response falls short in fully addressing the concern."
