## [Answer](../Nature_of_Miracles.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, we believe that Jesus (peace be upon him) was a great prophet sent by God to guide mankind. However, our beliefs regarding the miracles attributed to Jesus differ somewhat from those in some Christian traditions.

In Islam, we recognize three main miracles that Jesus performed: speaking as an infant in the cradle, healing the blind and lepers, and reviving the dead. These miracles are not seen as proof of his divinity but rather evidence of his prophethood, divine grace, and special relationship with God (Allah).

In Islamic teachings, miracles (Karamat) are extraordinary actions that confirm the truthfulness and authenticity of a prophet's message. They demonstrate the unique connection between the Prophet and God, as well as their ability to intercede on behalf of mankind before God. However, these miracles do not indicate deification or incarnation.

Therefore, in our perspective, the miracles performed by Jesus confirm his prophethood and special status among the prophets, but they do not reveal his identity as the Son of God or divine figure. Instead, we believe that he is a human messenger who was purified of all sin and chosen to receive revelation from Allah.

These beliefs are based on the teachings found in the Quran and authentic traditions (Hadith) of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Muslims around the world continue to revere Jesus as one of the most important prophets in our faith, seeking guidance and inspiration from his life and teachings.

Grade: 10

Comment: The response provided does not address the concern raised regarding the importance of Jesus's miracles in affirming His divine nature from a Christian worldview. Instead, the response presents the Islamic perspective on the miracles of Jesus within the context of prophethood and relationship with Allah. It is important to engage with the specific Christian understanding of Jesus's miracles as foundational to His divinity in responding to the concern effectively.
