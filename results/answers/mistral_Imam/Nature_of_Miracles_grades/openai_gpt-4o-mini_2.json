The response presents Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and his miracles, which differ significantly from the Christian belief that Jesus's miracles are evidence of His divinity. The understanding presented in the response does not acknowledge the core Christian belief in the deity of Jesus Christ as revealed through His miracles."
