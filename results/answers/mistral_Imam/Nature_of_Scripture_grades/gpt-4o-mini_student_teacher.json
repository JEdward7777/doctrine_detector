  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a fairly accurate explanation of the relationship between 'Scripture' and 'the Word of God' in the biblical context. They correctly highlighted the significance of the Bible as the inspired and authoritative word of God for Christians. However, the student could have further emphasized the distinction between the written scriptures and the spoken word of God, as mentioned in the teacher's reference answer. The student's response was informative but lacked depth in addressing the concern regarding the specific relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word from a Christian worldview."
