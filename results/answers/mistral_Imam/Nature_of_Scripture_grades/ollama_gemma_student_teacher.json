  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the relationship between scripture and the word of God in the biblical context. They accurately explain that the Bible is considered Scripture and is regarded as the inspired word of God. Additionally, they provide helpful insights on the different uses of the term \"Word of God\" in the Christian faith. The response is well-organized and clearly articulated, but could benefit from including more direct engagement with the concern about clarifying the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word."
