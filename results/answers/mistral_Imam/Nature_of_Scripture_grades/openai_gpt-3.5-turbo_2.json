  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the relationship between written scripture and God's spoken word within the Christian context, drawing on biblical references and terminology. The discussion of the term 'Word of God' as it pertains to both Jesus Christ and the Bible is well articulated. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the dual nature of the 'Word of God' encompassing both written and spoken messages from God. However, the response could further elaborate on how Christians view the Bible as the living and active Word of God, not just a historical text."
