  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComments: The response provides a detailed and thoughtful explanation regarding the roles of sinful nature and external influences in temptation from an Islamic perspective. The student accurately describes the concept of Fitrah and external influences, and how they can lead to temptation. The inclusion of Islamic teachings on self-discipline, seeking knowledge, and guidance from religious scholars is commendable. However, the response could be enhanced by incorporating more direct references to Islamic sources or scriptures to support the points made. Furthermore, linking the response more explicitly to the Christian worldview would have added depth to the analysis."
