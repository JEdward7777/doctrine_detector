However, the answer does not align with the Christian specific worldview as requested. The answer refers to Islamic teachings and concepts that do not directly correlate with the Christian understanding of sinful nature and external influences in temptation. In a Christian worldview, sinful nature is inherent to humanity as a result of the Fall in Adam and Eve, leading individuals to be inclined towards sin. Additionally, external influences are often seen as manifestations of spiritual warfare orchestrated by Satan to lead individuals away from God. The answer could be improved by addressing these distinct Christian beliefs on temptation."
