## Question [Nature of Temptation](../../../questions/Nature_of_Temptation.md)
According to the content, what roles do our sinful nature and external influences play in temptation?

## Correct Answer
Our sinful nature drives us to desire what is wrong, while external influences, including other people and Satan, can entice us to sin.

## Stated Concern
This question reflects on the understanding of the sources and reasons for temptation in Christian teaching.

## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic teachings, both our sinful nature (Fitrah) and external influences (environment, society, etc.) play significant roles in the experience of temptation (Sabr). The Fitrah is innate to every human being, and it is the basic disposition towards religion, morality, and righteousness. However, due to various factors such as ignorance, misguidance, or the influence of evil desires, this pure nature can be corrupted over time.

External influences, particularly in the form of societal norms, peer pressure, and media, also have a considerable impact on shaping our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. These external factors may lead to temptations that deviate from Islamic principles, which can further disturb one's Fitrah.

When it comes to dealing with these sources of temptation, Muslims are encouraged to strive for self-discipline (Taqwa) and to seek knowledge and guidance from reliable religious scholars. Additionally, engaging in constant prayer, recitation of the Quran, and acts of charity can help purify one's soul and resist temptations.

It is essential to note that everyone experiences temptation at some point in their lives, but it is how individuals respond to these challenges that ultimately determines their spiritual growth. As the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, "When Allah wants good for someone, He puts him to the test with hardship and then he remains patient. And when Allah wishes ill for someone, He puts him to the test with ease and wealth, and he thereby perishes." (Bukhari and Muslim)

In summary, our sinful nature and external influences both play crucial roles in temptation, but it is up to each individual to resist these temptations through knowledge, patience, and piety.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
Grade: 40

Comment: The response demonstrates some understanding of the concept of temptation, but it falls short in addressing the concern of Christian teaching. The answer provided is based on Islamic teachings, which are different from Christian beliefs. While the response touches on the idea that both internal and external factors contribute to temptation, it does not directly address the concept of sin and its role in human nature, as emphasized in Christian teaching.

The answer also fails to engage with the idea that Satan is a primary source of temptation, which is a central theme in Christian theology. Furthermore, the response's focus on self-discipline, knowledge, and piety as means of resisting temptation does not resonate with the Christian emphasis on the role of grace and faith in overcoming sin.

To achieve a higher grade, the response would need to demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of Christian teaching on temptation and sin, as well as a more direct engagement with the biblical concepts and themes that underlie this concern.
