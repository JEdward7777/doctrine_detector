  "grade_comment": "Grade: 45\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the sources and reasons for temptation in Islamic teachings, but it does not align closely enough with Christian beliefs on this topic. The Christian worldview sees temptation as primarily stemming from our sinful nature (inherited from the fall of Adam and Eve) and from external influences such as the devil and the world. The response does not sufficiently address these key Christian teachings on temptation."
