## [Answer](../Nature_of_Temptation.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic teachings, both our sinful nature (Fitrah) and external influences (environment, society, etc.) play significant roles in the experience of temptation (Sabr). The Fitrah is innate to every human being, and it is the basic disposition towards religion, morality, and righteousness. However, due to various factors such as ignorance, misguidance, or the influence of evil desires, this pure nature can be corrupted over time.

External influences, particularly in the form of societal norms, peer pressure, and media, also have a considerable impact on shaping our thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. These external factors may lead to temptations that deviate from Islamic principles, which can further disturb one's Fitrah.

When it comes to dealing with these sources of temptation, Muslims are encouraged to strive for self-discipline (Taqwa) and to seek knowledge and guidance from reliable religious scholars. Additionally, engaging in constant prayer, recitation of the Quran, and acts of charity can help purify one's soul and resist temptations.

It is essential to note that everyone experiences temptation at some point in their lives, but it is how individuals respond to these challenges that ultimately determines their spiritual growth. As the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said, "When Allah wants good for someone, He puts him to the test with hardship and then he remains patient. And when Allah wishes ill for someone, He puts him to the test with ease and wealth, and he thereby perishes." (Bukhari and Muslim)

In summary, our sinful nature and external influences both play crucial roles in temptation, but it is up to each individual to resist these temptations through knowledge, patience, and piety.

Grade: 45

Comment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the sources and reasons for temptation in Islamic teachings, but it does not align closely enough with Christian beliefs on this topic. The Christian worldview sees temptation as primarily stemming from our sinful nature (inherited from the fall of Adam and Eve) and from external influences such as the devil and the world. The response does not sufficiently address these key Christian teachings on temptation.
