  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the sources and reasons for temptation in Islamic teachings, focusing on the sinful nature (Fitrah) and external influences. While it offers valuable insights, it lacks a direct comparison or reflection on the Christian understanding of temptation. To improve the grade, the response could have included a clearer analysis of how the Christian worldview views temptation in contrast to the Islamic perspective."
