  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of how the Bible suggests individuals can be wicked in their actions, drawing on various verses and themes from both the Old and New Testaments. However, the student's response focused more on Islamic perspectives rather than Christian perspectives, which was the required framework for the answer. Additionally, the student did not fully address the concern of how biblical perspectives on wickedness can influence moral behavior and spiritual growth. A stronger emphasis on analyzing the impact of wickedness on moral behavior and spiritual growth from a Christian worldview would have strengthened the answer."
