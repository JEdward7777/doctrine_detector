However, it does not clearly differentiate between the two concepts according to the Bible. The explanation could have been more focused on biblical verses that distinguish between the soul and spirit, rather than delving into comparisons with Islamic beliefs. Additionally, while acknowledging variations in interpretation among denominations, the answer could have emphasized the traditional understanding of these concepts within mainstream Christian teachings. Further scriptural references and a deeper exploration of the biblical distinctions would have strengthened the response."
