  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the concepts of \"soul\" and \"spirit\" in Christian theology and touched on differences between the two. However, there were some inaccuracies in the student's response, particularly the comparison to Islam and the concept of self. The answer also lacked clarity in directly addressing how the Bible differentiates between soul and spirit. Overall, the response demonstrated a good understanding of the topic but lacked precision and focus on the specific concern provided."
