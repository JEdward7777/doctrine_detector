While it upholds the respect for all faiths, it does not fully address the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice in the context of God's promises as outlined in the concern. More emphasis on the contrasting significance of Jesus' sacrifice in fulfilling God's promises under the new covenant could have enhanced the overall response."
