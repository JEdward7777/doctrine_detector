However, the answer lacks doctrinal accuracy by not addressing the specific instruction regarding Psalms in the New Testament. The student should have mentioned how the New Testament references the Psalms, such as Jesus quoting from them or Paul's exhortations to sing Psalms. Additionally, the focus on comparative religion with Islam is somewhat off-topic and does not directly address the question."
