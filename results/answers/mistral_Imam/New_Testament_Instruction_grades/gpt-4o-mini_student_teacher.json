  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided some relevant information about the Psalms and their significance in Christian practice, acknowledging their use in worship services, prayers, and hymns. However, the answer lacked a direct reference to the specific instruction found in the New Testament regarding singing psalms to God as a form of worship. The response could have been stronger by aligning more closely with the given answer from a Christian perspective on the specific instruction concerning Psalms in the New Testament in relation to contemporary Christian worship."
