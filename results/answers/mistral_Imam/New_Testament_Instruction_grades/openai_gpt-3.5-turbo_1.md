# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices, but I can share information about various religious texts based on research. In the Christian context, the Psalms are considered part of the Old Testament, which is also known as the Hebrew Bible. Christians believe that these Psalms were written by various authors, many of whom were prophets or religious leaders in ancient Israel.

However, it's important to note that the Old Testament is not identical for Muslims and Christians due to different canons. Muslims consider parts of the Old Testament as part of their scripture but not all books are included. The Christian New Testament does not contain the Psalms, but rather focuses on the teachings and life of Jesus Christ, the resurrection, and the early Christian church.

That being said, many Christians do study and appreciate the Psalms for their wisdom, spiritual insight, and poetic beauty. They are often used in Christian worship services, prayers, and hymns. In this sense, the Psalms remain significant in Christian religious practice.
