The mention of singing Psalms as a way of worshiping God aligns well with the concern about identifying how biblical teachings apply to contemporary Christian worship. The response could have been strengthened by including a specific example or verse from the Psalms to illustrate how this biblical practice is carried out in modern Christian worship settings."
