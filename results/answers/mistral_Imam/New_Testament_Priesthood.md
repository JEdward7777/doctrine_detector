## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations. However, I can help explain historical interpretations based on scholarly works and the texts themselves. In the New Testament, the term "priest" is not directly applied to every believer in Jesus. The priesthood in the New Testament is associated with the Levitical order in the Old Testament, which was a specific group of Israelites responsible for maintaining the Tabernacle and Temple.

However, a concept that comes close to this in the New Testament is the idea of all believers becoming "a royal priesthood, a holy nation" (1 Peter 2:9). This passage refers more to the spiritual function and status of every Christian, rather than a specific role within the Church. In essence, every believer has direct access to God through faith in Jesus Christ, a privilege previously restricted to the priests under the Old Covenant.

It's important to note that interpretations can vary among different Muslim and Christian scholars, and the understanding of religious texts can be influenced by cultural, historical, and theological factors. For a more nuanced and contextually-rich discussion, it is always recommended to consult scholarly works or seek guidance from religious leaders who are knowledgeable in these matters.
