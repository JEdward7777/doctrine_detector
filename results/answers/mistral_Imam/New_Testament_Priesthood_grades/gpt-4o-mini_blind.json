  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response a 60. While the explanation touches on the concept of believers being considered a priest in the New Testament, it falls short in fully articulating the depth of this theological truth. The student correctly mentions 1 Peter 2:9, which does highlight believers as a royal priesthood, but misses the opportunity to delve deeper into the significance of this identity in terms of Christians being able to approach God directly through Jesus Christ. Additionally, the response could have benefitted from a clearer distinction between the Levitical priesthood in the Old Testament and the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament. It is important for the student to strengthen their understanding of Christian doctrine and provide more precise and doctrinally nuanced explanations in the future."
