  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provided a good explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament, they missed the mark by not addressing the significance of believers being able to come directly to God in prayer to intercede for themselves and others. Their answer lacked a clear connection to the importance of the priesthood in Christianity and the direct access believers have to God through Jesus Christ. The student did, however, demonstrate an understanding of the broader concept of priesthood in the Bible and offered a nuanced perspective on the topic."
