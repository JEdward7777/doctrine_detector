  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the concept of the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament. They accurately explain that the traditional priesthood in the Old Testament was limited to the Levitical order, but that in the New Testament, every believer is considered a \"royal priesthood.\" The student also correctly points out that this concept emphasizes the direct access to God through faith in Jesus Christ. The response is well-reasoned and supported by relevant biblical references."
