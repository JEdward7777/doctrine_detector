  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response partially addresses the concern about understanding the concept of the priesthood of all believers by referencing 1 Peter 2:9, which speaks to every believer being a \"royal priesthood.\" However, it could be further developed and nuanced to fully address the concept. The response does a good job of providing historical context and highlighting the idea that every believer has direct access to God through faith in Jesus Christ. Additionally, the mention of scholarly works and seeking guidance from religious leaders is an important note on the complexity of interpreting religious texts. Overall, while the response provides some insight into the concept, it could be more thoroughly explored to better address the concern."
