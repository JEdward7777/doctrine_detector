  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the concept of the priesthood of all believers by referencing 1 Peter 2:9 and highlighting the idea that every believer has direct access to God through faith in Jesus Christ. The mention of the importance of consulting scholarly works and religious leaders for a more nuanced discussion adds depth to the analysis. The only potential improvement would be to explicitly connect the concept to a Christian worldview, emphasizing the biblical foundation and significance of the priesthood of all believers within Christianity."
