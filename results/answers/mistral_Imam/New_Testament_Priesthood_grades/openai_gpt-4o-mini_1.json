It correctly explains the distinction between the Levitical priesthood in the Old Testament and the priesthood of all believers in the New Testament, highlighting the direct access to God through faith in Jesus Christ. The inclusion of 1 Peter 2:9 to support the idea of believers being a royal priesthood is commendable. The response also appropriately encourages consulting scholarly works and religious leaders for a deeper understanding. Overall, this is a well-informed and well-articulated response from a Christian perspective."
