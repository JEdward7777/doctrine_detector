The biblical reference to 1 Peter 2:9 is appropriately cited to support this understanding. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of this concept within Christian theology and practice, highlighting the priesthood's role in interceding for oneself and others. Overall, a well-informed and thoughtful response."
