  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise comparison between purification in the Old Testament (Judaism) and the New Testament (Christianity). The student accurately highlights the shift from physical and ritualistic practices to a focus on spiritual purification in Christianity. Scriptural references are appropriately cited to support the explanation. However, the response could be enhanced by delving deeper into the theological significance of purification in each testament and how it relates to salvation and sanctification within the Christian faith. Overall, a solid effort with room for more theological depth."
