  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of purification in the Old Testament and New Testament within Judaism and Christianity, respectively. They correctly highlight the shift from physical and ritualistic practices in the Old Testament to spiritual purification in the New Testament. However, the student could have further emphasized the significance of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, as stated in the teacher's reference answer. Overall, a solid response with room for a little more emphasis on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice in the context of purification."
