It correctly highlights the shift from physical and ritualistic practices in the Old Testament to spiritual purification in the New Testament, emphasizing Jesus' teachings on inner purity. However, while it mentions Jesus' sacrifice, it does not explicitly connect this to the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice as the means of eternal purification from sin, which is the primary concern.\n\nThe response could be strengthened by more directly addressing the question and concern. For example, it could have elaborated on how Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for eternal purification from sin, rather than just mentioning it in passing. Nevertheless, the overall response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical concepts and their relevance to the topic of purification."
