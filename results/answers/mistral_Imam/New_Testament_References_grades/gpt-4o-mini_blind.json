  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thoughtful analysis of the potential connections between John the Baptist and the Nazirite vow based on relevant New Testament passages. The inclusion of multiple references and the cautious approach regarding interpretations align with sound theological reasoning. However, to strengthen the grade further, the student could have delved deeper into the historical and cultural context of Nazirite vows in relation to John's life and ministry. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates an understanding of how to approach textual analysis within a Christian worldview."
