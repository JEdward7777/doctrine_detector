  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 80. The student provided insightful interpretations of various New Testament passages that could potentially suggest John the Baptist exhibited characteristics of a Nazirite. However, the reference answer from the teacher provides a more direct and concrete evidence that John may have been under the Nazirite vow. The student did well in making connections between Old Testament practices and New Testament figures to enhance biblical continuity, but could have strengthened their argument by referencing the angel's announcement to Zechariah as their primary evidence."
