  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful analysis of the New Testament texts relevant to the question. They present several plausible arguments suggesting that John the Baptist may have been a Nazirite, while also acknowledging the absence of explicit confirmation in the scriptures. \n\nHowever, the grade could be improved by:\n\n* **Greater clarity in stating the specific connection to the concern:** The student's answer briefly mentions connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures, but could elaborate on how their arguments contribute to understanding biblical continuity.\n* **More rigorous textual analysis:** The student's interpretation of certain verses is solid, but could benefit from further evidence or analysis of the broader context.\n* **Inclusion of additional perspectives:** The student's answer would be stronger with reference to scholarly interpretations or historical contexts that shed light on the possibility of John the Baptist being a Nazirite."
