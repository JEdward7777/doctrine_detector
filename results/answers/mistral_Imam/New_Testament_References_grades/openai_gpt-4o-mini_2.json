  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a well-reasoned interpretation of passages in the New Testament that suggest similarities between John the Baptist and the Nazirite vow, demonstrating an understanding of connecting Old Testament practices with New Testament figures. The student appropriately notes the lack of explicit statement in the New Testament while presenting compelling evidence for a potential connection. A higher grade could be achieved by deepening the theological reflection on the significance of such connections within Christian theology."
