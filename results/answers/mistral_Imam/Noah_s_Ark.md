## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I don't have personal beliefs about the Bible or its specific interpretations. However, I can tell you that according to Islamic tradition and the Quran (23:23-28), Prophet Noah was sent as a messenger by Allah to warn his people of impending flood punishment for their disbelief and wickedness.

In the story of Prophet Noah, a large vessel called "safina" in Arabic is mentioned, which he built to save himself, his family, and selected righteous individuals from the corruption of mankind. This vessel was not an ark as it is commonly known in the Bible but rather a ship or boat.

The purpose of the safina, according to Islamic belief, was to protect those who believed in Allah and Prophet Noah's message during the flood that Allah sent upon the disbelievers. This event serves as a reminder for Muslims about the importance of faith in Allah, obedience to His messengers, and the dire consequences of disobedience.

I hope this helps clarify the Islamic perspective on the purpose of Noah's vessel or safina.
