From a Christian worldview, the purpose of Noah's Ark, as outlined in Genesis chapters 6-9, was to preserve Noah, his family, and pairs of all land-dwelling, air-breathing creatures from the global flood God sent as judgment on a sinful world. The response could have been improved by addressing this specific aspect."
