  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: While the student provided an informative perspective from Islamic tradition on Prophet Noah and the purpose of the vessel, the response did not address the concern of understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation as described in the narrative of Noah's Ark in the Bible. The Christian worldview emphasizes God's judgment on humanity and His provision of salvation through Noah's Ark, which was missing in the student's response."
