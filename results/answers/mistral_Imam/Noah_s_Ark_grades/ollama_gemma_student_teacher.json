  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 70\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the biblical narrative of Noah's Ark from an Islamic perspective. It provides a concise explanation of the purpose of the vessel as a means of protection during the flood, citing relevant Islamic traditions and scripture. However, the answer does not address the Christian specific worldview or concern related to God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative."
