However, from a Christian worldview, the response deviates from the biblical understanding of Noah's Ark as a means of salvation and preservation for Noah, his family, and the animals during the flood as a result of God's judgment. While it is informative about the Islamic perspective, the answer does not directly address the concern about understanding God's plan for salvation and preservation in the narrative of Noah's Ark from a Christian viewpoint."
