## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, wisdom is highly valued as it is considered one of the attributes of Allah (God). The Quran states: "Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction. And [it is] wrongeousness for them to worship except Allah Alone and to associate partners with Him. And those who associate others with Allah say, 'Are we not on a right path?' What is the knowledge of the unjust? Only they are reminded that indeed there was a clear proof from your Lord to you, so as to whoever possesses intelligence may remember." (Surah Al-Imran 3:169-170)

Listening to God means following His guidance and adhering to the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. This practice leads to wisdom in several ways:

1. Understanding the purpose of life: The Quran provides clear guidance on the purpose of human existence, which is to worship Allah alone and seek His pleasure by living a righteous life. By following this path, one gains wisdom about the true meaning of life.

2. Acquiring knowledge: Islam encourages seeking knowledge, as it is seen as an act of worship. The more we learn about Allah's creation, laws, and His attributes, the wiser we become in understanding the world around us.

3. Cultivating good character: Islam emphasizes the importance of developing a good character, which includes traits such as patience, honesty, kindness, and gratitude. These qualities foster wisdom and guide us towards making wise decisions in our daily lives.

4. Strengthening moral judgment: By adhering to the principles set forth by Allah and guided by His revelations, we are able to develop a strong moral compass that enables us to discern right from wrong, leading to wiser choices and actions.

5. Gaining humility: Recognizing and accepting our limitations and dependence on Allah is essential for gaining wisdom. By acknowledging that all knowledge and guidance comes from Him, we are humbled and open ourselves to receiving His wisdom.

In summary, listening to God connects to becoming wise by following the Quranic teachings, seeking knowledge, cultivating good character, strengthening moral judgment, and gaining humility. By striving towards these goals, Muslims can attain wisdom that guides them in their spiritual and worldly lives.
