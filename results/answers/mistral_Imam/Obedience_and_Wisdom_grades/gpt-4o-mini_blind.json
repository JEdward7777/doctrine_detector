However, the answer could be improved by focusing more on the importance of a personal relationship with God through prayer and meditation, as well as emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in imparting wisdom. Additionally, citing specific examples or stories from Islamic tradition to illustrate the connection between listening to God and wisdom would enhance the overall depth of the response."
