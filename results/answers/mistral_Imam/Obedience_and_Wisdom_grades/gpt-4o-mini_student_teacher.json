  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of how listening to God in Islam leads to wisdom, focusing on understanding the purpose of life, acquiring knowledge, cultivating good character, strengthening moral judgment, and gaining humility. While the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the topic and includes relevant Quranic references, it falls short of directly addressing the concern of recognizing the link between obedience to God and wisdom in enhancing one's spiritual journey. The student could strengthen their answer by explicitly linking the act of listening to God with obedience to His will, which is essential for fulfilling the concern provided."
