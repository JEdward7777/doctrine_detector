It provides specific examples from Islamic teachings, such as seeking knowledge, cultivating good character, and strengthening moral judgment, which illustrates the connection between obedience to God and wisdom. The emphasis on humility and recognizing one's limitations is also a key aspect of becoming wise, as it acknowledges that all knowledge and guidance come from Allah.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the link between obedience to God and wisdom, which can indeed enhance one's spiritual journey. However, some points could be further developed or expanded upon to provide more depth and nuance in the discussion. Overall, a strong effort!"
