## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic understanding, the Torah that was given to Moses (peace be upon him) is considered one of the revealed books of Allah (God), along with the Quran, Gospel, and Psalms. The stories, laws, and teachings in these scriptures are all part of the divine guidance sent down to mankind.

The concept of a covenant between God and His people is an essential theme that runs throughout these revealed books, and it is particularly emphasized in the Torah. A covenant (Arabic: Ø£hd) refers to a solemn agreement or bond between God and His chosen people, through which He outlines the terms of their relationship and obligations.

The covenant made with Moses and his people at Mount Sinai is one of the most well-known examples in Jewish tradition. This covenant entailed certain laws (the "Ten Commandments") as a part of this agreement between God and His chosen nation, which includes promises, responsibilities, and guidelines for living a just and ethical life.

In the Islamic perspective, Muslims believe that the Torah, like all revealed scriptures, contains truth and guidance, but over time, certain aspects may have been altered or distorted (Tahrif). The essential message of monotheism, moral responsibility, and obedience to God remains valid and unchanged.

The Quran also speaks about the covenant between God and His people in several verses, such as: "We took from the Prophets their solemn covenant: that they would uphold the Law of Moses; but later they believed in a portion of it, and they rejected another part. They were not all alike: there was a party among them who followed the guidance of Allah, but many of them were habitually wicked." (Quran 2:85)

So, to summarize, the laws given to Moses are an essential part of the covenant between God and His people, as revealed in the Torah. While Muslims believe that these scriptures have been altered over time, they hold that their core message of monotheism and ethical guidance remains valid and relevant today.
