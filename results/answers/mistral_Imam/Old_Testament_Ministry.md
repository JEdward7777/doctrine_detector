## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Old Testament, the priests carried out their ministry primarily within the Tabernacle or later, the Temple in Jerusalem, as described in the Books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Ezekiel.

Their duties were divided into three main categories: daily rituals, annual rituals, and special rituals.

1. Daily Rituals (Exodus 29; Leviticus 6):
   - Burning incense on the golden altar of incense (Exodus 30:7-8).
   - Making atonement offerings for the people's sins (Leviticus 1-6).
   - Tending to the seven-branched lampstand (menorah) and the showbread (Exodus 25:37; Leviticus 24:2-3).
   - Slaughtering animals for burnt offerings, peace offerings, and sin offerings (Leviticus 1-7).
   - Washing themselves and the equipment used in the rituals to maintain purity (Exodus 30:19-21; Leviticus 6:24-30).

2. Annual Rituals (Leviticus 16, 23):
   - The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) on which the high priest would make atonement for himself and the people (Leviticus 16).
   - Passover (Pesach), Firstfruits, Feast of Weeks (Shavuot), Feast of Trumpets (Rosh Hashanah), Day of Atonement, Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot) and Last Great Day (Shemini Atzeret) as prescribed in Leviticus 23.

3. Special Rituals:
   - Consecrating priests and leaders (Exodus 40:13; Leviticus 8).
   - Dedicating the Tabernacle or Temple (Numbers 7; Ezekiel 43-46).

The priests were also responsible for teaching and instructing the Israelites in God's laws and statutes (Leviticus 10:11).

It is essential to remember that Jewish priests in the Old Testament are distinct from Imams in Islam. While the functions of the two roles are not entirely comparable due to their differences in religious contexts, they both share a role as spiritual leaders and intermediaries between the people and God.
