The student clearly outlines the various duties and responsibilities of the priests, including daily rituals, annual rituals, special rituals, and their role in teaching the Israelites God's laws. The inclusion of relevant references from the Books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Ezekiel further strengthens the response."
