The mention of the distinction between Jewish priests and Imams in Islam was relevant to the context. The response effectively addresses the concern by illustrating how understanding the practices of the Old Testament can inform current ministry approaches and the concept of sacrificial service. However, a deeper exploration of the theological significance and spiritual implications of these practices could have enhanced the response further."
