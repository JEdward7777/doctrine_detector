## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Old Testament, as per Islamic understanding since we do not have a specific scripture like the New Testament, the concept of atonement primarily revolves around the system of sacrifices (Udhiyah or Qurbani) and repentance. The system of sacrifice was initially established by God to Adam and Eve to seek forgiveness for their sin, and it continued through Abraham and Moses, culminating in the Tabernacle and Temple systems during the Israelites' sojourn in the desert and later in the Land of Israel.

In contrast, New Testament teachings place significant emphasis on Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice who atones for human sins. The crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are central to this understanding. Christians believe that through faith in Jesus, people can be forgiven for their sins, a concept encapsulated by the phrase "the blood of Jesus" or Christus Victor theory.

Islam, on the other hand, upholds that all prophets and messengers of God – including Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus – were guiding humanity towards the same truth, but each was sent to specific groups at different times. The Quran affirms the crucifixion of Jesus (peace be upon him) in Surah Al-Nisa (4:157-158), yet it clarifies that he was not killed or crucified, but rather God raised him to Himself (Quran 4:158).

In Islam, atonement is achieved primarily through sincere repentance and seeking God's forgiveness, as well as through good deeds. The concept of Qadar (divine predestination) in Islam also plays a role in understanding atonement, as Muslims believe that God has already forgiven our sins before they are committed, as stated in the verse "He it is Who forgives all sins: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful" (Quran 42:25). However, we must seek His forgiveness and strive to correct our actions to avoid repeating past mistakes.

In summary, while the Old Testament emphasizes atonement through sacrifices and repentance, the New Testament places more focus on Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for human sins. Islam upholds that all prophets guide humanity towards God's truth, but emphasizes atonement through sincere repentance, seeking God's forgiveness, and performing good deeds.
