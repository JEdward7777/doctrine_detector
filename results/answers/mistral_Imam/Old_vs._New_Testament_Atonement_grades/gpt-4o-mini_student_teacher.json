  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: This student's answer provides a detailed comparison of the concepts of atonement in Islam, the Old Testament, and the New Testament, which demonstrates knowledge and research on the topic. However, the response does not directly address the specified concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history. The student also focuses more on providing information on Islamic beliefs rather than thoroughly analyzing the difference between Old and New Testament views on atonement. The answer lacks a clear comparison between the temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament and Christ's ultimate sacrifice in the New Testament as highlighted in the reference answer. Further integration of biblical references and specific Christian theological concepts would have strengthened the analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
