While it provides some background information on the Old Testament's emphasis on sacrifices and repentance, as well as the New Testament's focus on Jesus' sacrifice, it does not explicitly discuss how these two understandings of atonement transition from one to another.\n\nThe response does touch upon the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice in the New Testament, but this is primarily presented as a distinct concept rather than a development from the Old Testament. Additionally, there is no explicit attempt to bridge the gap between the temporary sacrifices of the Old Testament and the permanent atonement offered through Jesus' sacrifice.\n\nTo improve, the response could have more explicitly explored the theological and historical connections between the Old and New Testaments, highlighting how the concept of atonement evolves from a system of temporary sacrifices to a single, permanent sacrifice in Christ."
