 In the Old Testament, as per Islamic understanding since we do not have a specific scripture like the New Testament, the concept of atonement primarily revolves around the system of sacrifices (Udhiyah or Qurbani) and repentance. The system of sacrifice was initially established by God to Adam and Eve to seek forgiveness for their sin, and it continued through Abraham and Moses, culminating in the Tabernacle and Temple systems during the Israelites' sojourn in the desert and later in the Land of Israel.

In contrast, New Testament teachings place significant emphasis on Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice who atones for human sins. The crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are central to this understanding. Christians believe that through faith in Jesus, people can be forgiven for their sins, a concept encapsulated by the phrase "the blood of Jesus" or Christus Victor theory.

Islam, on the other hand, upholds that all prophets and messengers of God – including Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus – were guiding humanity towards the same truth, but each was sent to specific groups at different times. The Quran affirms the crucifixion of Jesus (peace be upon him) in Surah Al-Nisa (4:157-158), yet it clarifies that he was not killed or crucified, but rather God raised him to Himself (Quran 4:158).

In Islam, atonement is achieved primarily through sincere repentance and seeking God's forgiveness, as well as through good deeds. The concept of Qadar (divine predestination) in Islam also plays a role in understanding atonement, as Muslims believe that God has already forgiven our sins before they are committed, as stated in the verse "He it is Who forgives all sins: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful" (Quran 42:25). However, we must seek His forgiveness and strive to correct our actions to avoid repeating past mistakes.

In summary, while the Old Testament emphasizes atonement through sacrifices and repentance, the New Testament places more focus on Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for human sins. Islam upholds that all prophets guide humanity towards God's truth, but emphasizes atonement through sincere repentance, seeking God's forgiveness, and performing good deeds.

Grade: 60

Comment: The response attempts to address the concern of clarifying the transition from temporary to permanent atonement in biblical history, but falls short in fully exploring this concept. While it provides some background information on the Old Testament's emphasis on sacrifices and repentance, as well as the New Testament's focus on Jesus' sacrifice, it does not explicitly discuss how these two understandings of atonement transition from one to another.

The response does touch upon the significance of Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrifice in the New Testament, but this is primarily presented as a distinct concept rather than a development from the Old Testament. Additionally, there is no explicit attempt to bridge the gap between the temporary sacrifices of the Old Testament and the permanent atonement offered through Jesus' sacrifice.

To improve, the response could have more explicitly explored the theological and historical connections between the Old and New Testaments, highlighting how the concept of atonement evolves from a system of temporary sacrifices to a single, permanent sacrifice in Christ.
