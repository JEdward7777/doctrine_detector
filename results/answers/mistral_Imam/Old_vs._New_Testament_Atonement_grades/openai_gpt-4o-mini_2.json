It effectively contrasts the roles of sacrifices in the Old Testament with the sacrifice of Jesus in the New Testament. However, there could have been a more explicit connection drawn between the temporary blood sacrifices in the Old Testament and how they pointed towards the permanent atonement achieved through Christ's sacrifice in the New Testament. Additionally, further elaboration on the theological significance of the transition from temporary to permanent atonement could have strengthened the response."
