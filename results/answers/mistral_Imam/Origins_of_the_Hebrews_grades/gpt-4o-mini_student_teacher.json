  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation about the heritage of the Hebrew people, mentioning both the biblical perspective and the Islamic perspective. However, the student's answer veers off slightly by including information about the Islamic perspective which may not directly address the specific concern of understanding the heritage of the Hebrew people in the Bible. The core point about the descent of Hebrews from Abraham through Isaac and Jacob is missing a bit of clarity and focus compared to the teacher's reference answer."
