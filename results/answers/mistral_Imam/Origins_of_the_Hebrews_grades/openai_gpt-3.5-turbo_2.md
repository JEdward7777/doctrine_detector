## [Answer](../Origins_of_the_Hebrews.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the biblical narrative, the Israelites or Children of Israel are considered the descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac and his son's secondborn, Jacob (or Israel). However, it is essential to note that the lineage of the Israelites as described in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) may differ from other accounts. The term "Hebrew" was initially used to denote people living east of the Jordan River, where the Hebrew language originated, but later came to refer specifically to the Israelites.

From the Islamic perspective, both Jews and Christians are considered People of the Book, meaning they share a common ancestry with Abraham, Ishmael (the son of Abraham through Hagar), and Isaac. According to the Quran, Muslims, Jews, and Christians all descend from the same two sons of Prophet Abraham: Ishmael and Isaac (Arabic: Ibrahim). The Prophet Muhammad is said to have descended from Ishmael through Ismail ibn Ibrahim (Isaac's brother), while the majority of Jews and Christians trace their ancestry back to Isaac.

In summary, from a biblical perspective, the Hebrews are descendants of Jacob/Israel, who was a son of Isaac, while from an Islamic point of view, they share a common ancestor in Prophet Abraham through Ishmael or Isaac, depending on their specific lineage.
