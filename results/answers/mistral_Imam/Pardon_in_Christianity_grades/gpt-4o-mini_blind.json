However, it lacks a direct comparison to the Christian concept of pardon through Jesus Christ, which was the focus of the original question. While it is important to respect and acknowledge different religious beliefs, a stronger connection to the Christian understanding of forgiveness through Jesus Christ would have enhanced the completeness of the response."
