  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 50. \n\nWhile the student provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic concept of pardon and forgiveness, the response does not satisfactorily address the specific concern of exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness as understood in the Christian context. The student fails to draw parallels or contrasts between the concepts of pardon in Islam and the Christian perspective, particularly through the lens of God's forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ. To improve the grade, the student should have connected the Islamic concept of seeking forgiveness through repentance and good deeds to the Christian belief in receiving pardon through Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross."
