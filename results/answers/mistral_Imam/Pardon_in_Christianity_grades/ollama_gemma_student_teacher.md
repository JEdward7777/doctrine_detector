## [Answer](../Pardon_in_Christianity.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that there is only one God (Allah), who is the Creator and Judge of all creation. He is compassionate, merciful, and just, but also a strict accountable for our actions in this life. The concept of pardon within Islamic theology does not revolve around the forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ as understood in Christianity.

In Islam, it's believed that God forgives those who repent sincerely, perform good deeds, and avoid committing sins. This is achieved by seeking His forgiveness (Tawbah) with a heart free from any intentions to repeat the sin, and by striving to live according to the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah (the practices of Prophet Muhammad).

The Islamic concept of pardon emphasizes on self-reformation, seeking guidance, and mending relationships. It's important to note that in Islam, the idea of Original Sin is not present. Each person bears responsibility for their own actions.

While it is important to respect and acknowledge different religious beliefs, it's essential to understand that these beliefs may vary significantly between religions. The core belief in Islam remains the oneness of God, and we strive to live by His guidance as best we can.

**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of pardon within Islam, highlighting the emphasis on self-reformation, seeking guidance, and mending relationships. However, it does not directly address the relationship between pardon and God's forgiveness of sin through Jesus Christ as specified in the concern. The response provides information about Islamic beliefs regarding forgiveness but does not connect it to the specific concept of pardon related to Christianity.
