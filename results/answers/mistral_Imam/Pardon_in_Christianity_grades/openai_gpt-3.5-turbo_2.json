It correctly highlights the absence of the Christian belief in forgiveness through Jesus Christ. However, it does not directly engage with the concern of exploring the relationship between pardon and divine forgiveness from a Christian worldview. A stronger response would have contrasted the Christian understanding of pardon through Jesus Christ with the Islamic perspective, highlighting the unique role of Christ in providing forgiveness for sins."
