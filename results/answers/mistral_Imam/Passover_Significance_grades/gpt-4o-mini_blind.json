  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a solid overview of the significance of Passover for Christians in relation to Jesus. The student accurately highlights the connections between Passover, the Last Supper, Jesus' crucifixion, and the establishment of the Eucharist. The explanation aligns well with Christian beliefs and doctrine. A minor improvement could be made by emphasizing Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb more explicitly. Overall, well-done."
