  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student did a good job in explaining the connection between Passover and Jesus in Christian belief, they missed emphasizing Jesus as the Passover Lamb and the significance of His perfect and sinless sacrifice for humanity. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the symbolism of the Passover meal in relation to the Eucharist and the New Covenant established by Jesus. Overall, they provided a solid foundation but could have expanded on the Christian significance of Jesus as the Passover Lamb."
