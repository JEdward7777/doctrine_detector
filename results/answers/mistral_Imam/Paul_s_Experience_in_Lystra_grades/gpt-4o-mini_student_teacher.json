  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive response that touched on various aspects related to perseverance, faith, and ministry in difficult circumstances. However, the answer mainly focused on lessons for Muslims rather than drawing specific applications for Christians. The response lacked a clear connection to the Christian worldview and did not emphasize the power of God to sustain and restore His servants, as highlighted in the teacher's reference answer. The student integrated relevant points but could improve by framing them within a Christian perspective."
