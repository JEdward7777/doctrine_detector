  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 75/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Christian perspective on faith in Jesus' sacrifice and its role in achieving peace with God. They clearly articulate the Islamic belief that Jesus was a prophet and acknowledge the significance of his life. However, they respectfully distance themselves from the Christian belief in Jesus' sacrifice as the sole means of salvation. The student's emphasis on Tawhid and following Islamic guidelines aligns with Islamic beliefs. The response promotes mutual understanding and respect between Muslims and Christians, which is commendable."
