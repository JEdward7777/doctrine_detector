It would have been beneficial to compare and contrast the Christian view on faith in Jesus' sacrifice with the Islamic perspective presented in the response. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, the emphasis on accepting Jesus' sacrifice for forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God is a fundamental aspect of faith and salvation, which could have been elaborated on further."
