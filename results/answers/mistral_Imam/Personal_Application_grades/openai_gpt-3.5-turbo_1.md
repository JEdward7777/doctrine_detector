# Question [Personal Application](../../../questions/Personal_Application.md)
What does it mean for a Christian to experience purification from sin?

# Correct Answer
For a Christian, experiencing purification from sin involves repentance, seeking God's forgiveness, and trusting in Jesusâ€™ sacrifice to cleanse them from all unrighteousness.

# Stated Concern
Understanding the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living.

# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that only Allah (God) can forgive sins. However, in the context of Christianity, I can share with you an understanding based on their beliefs. According to Christian teachings, purification from sin refers to the act of absolution or atonement granted by God through faith in Jesus Christ. In Christianity, it is believed that all humans are born with original sin due to Adam and Eve's disobedience in the Garden of Eden. This original sin separates mankind from God, making us unworthy of eternal life in heaven.

Through Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross, Christians believe they can receive forgiveness for their sins when they confess them and accept Jesus as their Savior and Lord. This act of faith is seen as an expression of repentance, which leads to purification from sin. In Christian teachings, this purification results in a restored relationship with God and the promise of eternal life.

It is essential to remember that these beliefs are unique to Christianity, and they may not align perfectly with Islamic teachings regarding sin, forgiveness, and salvation. As Muslims, our focus should be on understanding and respecting our own faith while striving for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect with people of other faiths.
