It addresses the concern by emphasizing the personal implications of being made pure in relation to one's relationship with God and commitment to holy living. The response could have delved deeper into the theological significance and transformative nature of this purification process, but overall it demonstrates a good understanding of Christian teachings on forgiveness and restoration of relationship with God."
