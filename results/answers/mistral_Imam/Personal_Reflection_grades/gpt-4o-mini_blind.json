  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComments: The student provides a well-structured response that explains the concept of expressing regret or sorrow over one's suffering or wrongdoing in the Islamic context. The inclusion of the hadith and Quranic verse adds depth to the explanation. However, the student could improve the response by directly addressing the expression \"woe is me\" within the Islamic context and providing more specific examples or interpretations related to this expression. Additionally, incorporating more explicit reference to the concept of sin and repentance would enhance the doctrinal correctness of the answer."
