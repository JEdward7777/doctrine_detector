  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response accurately reflects the sentiment behind the phrase \"Woe is me\" in both Islamic and Christian contexts, emphasizing personal reflection, self-awareness, and recognition of sin. The inclusion of Quranic verses and hadiths adds depth and credibility to the argument. The response also effectively highlights the importance of humility and repentance in the face of suffering or wrongdoing.\n\nWhile the response could be strengthened by further exploring the connections between this phrase and Christian teachings on guilt, shame, and redemption, it does an excellent job of modeling personal reflection and spiritual awareness."
