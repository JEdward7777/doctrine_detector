It effectively addresses the concern by showing how understanding the role of the Pharisees sheds light on the challenges Jesus faced in his ministry. The only improvement would be to explicitly mention the spiritual significance of the conflicts and how they reflect deeper theological differences between the Pharisees and Jesus."
