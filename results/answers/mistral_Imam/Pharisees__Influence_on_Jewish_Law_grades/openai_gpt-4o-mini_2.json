It addresses the concern by explaining how the Pharisees' strict adherence to the letter of the law created challenges for Jesus in his ministry. However, the response could have further emphasized the spiritual dimensions of the conflicts and the deeper theological implications of the Pharisees' approach. Additionally, it would have been beneficial to incorporate how Jesus' teachings and actions challenged the legalistic mindset of the Pharisees and emphasized love, mercy, and compassion."
