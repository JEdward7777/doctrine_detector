  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation comparing the interpretations of \"Son of God\" in Islam and Christianity, demonstrating a good understanding of the differences in belief. However, the response focused more on Islamic teachings than on addressing the concern of clarifying the term within a Christian context. The student could have further emphasized the Christian perspective that 'Son of God' in reference to Jesus signifies his divine nature and relationship with God, not physical procreation, as highlighted in the reference answer."
