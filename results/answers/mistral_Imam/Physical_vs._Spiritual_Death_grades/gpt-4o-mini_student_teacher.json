  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the concept of physical death and spiritual 'perishing' from an Islamic perspective. However, the answer lacks a Christian-specific worldview which is the context for this evaluation. The response does not address the distinction between physical and spiritual death within a Christian framework, as highlighted by the concern. The teacher's reference answer clarifies the importance of trusting in Jesus for spiritual salvation, which is a foundational belief in Christianity that the student's response does not address."
