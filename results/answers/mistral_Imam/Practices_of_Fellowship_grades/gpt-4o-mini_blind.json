The student effectively captures the essence of Christian community in the early Church, emphasizing key practices such as communal worship, sharing resources, breaking bread, house churches, caring for the needy, and discipleship. The inclusion of scriptural references enhances the doctrinal correctness of the answer. The response could be further improved by elaborating on the theological significance of these practices and their connection to Christ's teachings on love and unity."
