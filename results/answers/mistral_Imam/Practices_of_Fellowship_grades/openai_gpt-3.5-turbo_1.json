The explanation is thorough and aligns well with the concern about fostering deeper connections among contemporary Christians. The only suggestion for improvement would be to explicitly mention the importance of listening to the teaching of God's Word as a central aspect of early Christian fellowship, as it is a foundational practice that underpins many of the other expressions of fellowship discussed."
