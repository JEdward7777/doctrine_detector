  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of how early Christians expressed their fellowship through various practices such as communal worship, sharing resources, breaking bread together, house churches, caring for the needy, and discipleship/mentorship. The inclusion of specific biblical references and examples helps to support the discussion. The response effectively addresses the concern by showing how recognizing and implementing these historical practices of fellowship can indeed help contemporary Christians foster deeper connections with each other."
