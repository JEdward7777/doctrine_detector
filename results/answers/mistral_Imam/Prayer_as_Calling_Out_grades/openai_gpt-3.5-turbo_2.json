It effectively addresses the concern of the significance of prayer and dependence on God in daily life, highlighting the importance of seeking guidance and blessings from God in Islamic practice. However, from a Christian worldview, it could have included a comparison or contrast with the Christian understanding of prayer and dependence on God to provide a more comprehensive analysis."
