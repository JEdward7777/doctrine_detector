  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a generally accurate explanation of predestination in a Christian context, mentioning its connection to Calvinism and the belief in God's sovereign ordination before time began. However, the student went off-topic by comparing the concept of predestination in Christianity with Islam, which was not required in the context of the question. The focus should have been solely on explaining predestination within Christianity in relation to salvation."
