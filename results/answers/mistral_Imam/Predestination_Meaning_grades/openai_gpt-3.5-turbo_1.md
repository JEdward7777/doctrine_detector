# Question [Predestination Meaning](../../../questions/Predestination_Meaning.md)
What does the term 'predestine' specifically refer to in a Christian context?

# Correct Answer
It refers to God deciding beforehand that certain individuals will receive eternal life.

# Stated Concern
Understanding the concept of predestination in relation to salvation.

# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In a Christian context, predestination refers to the belief that all things have been ordained by God before time began, including human salvation and election (those chosen for salvation). This idea is most notably found within Calvinism, which is a branch of Protestant Christianity based on the teachings of John Calvin.

However, it's essential to note that the concept of predestination in Christianity significantly differs from the Islamic perspective. In Islam, God (Allah) is merciful and just, and human actions are not predestined but are a consequence of free will. The Quran emphasizes the importance of good deeds and accountability for one's actions on the Day of Judgment.

I hope this helps clarify the differences between the Christian and Islamic concepts of predestination.
