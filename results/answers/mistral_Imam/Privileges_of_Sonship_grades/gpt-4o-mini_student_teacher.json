  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student accurately referenced the passage in Romans and provided a basic understanding of the privileges received by adopted children of God, the response lacked depth in recognizing the true significance of the relationship between believers and God. The focus on the difference between Christian and Islamic perspectives was somewhat relevant but diverted attention from the central theme of intimacy and identity in the specified Biblical passage. More emphasis on the profound nature of being called 'Abba, Father' and the personal connection it signifies would have improved the grade."
