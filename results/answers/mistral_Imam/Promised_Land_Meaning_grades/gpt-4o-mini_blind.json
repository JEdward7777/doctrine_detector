However, from a Christian worldview, there are significant theological differences regarding the fulfillment of God's promises in the Old Testament, particularly in terms of the land promised to Abraham's descendants. It would be beneficial for the student to address the distinct Christian understanding of the Promised Land, emphasizing the specific land of Canaan as part of God's covenant with Abraham and its theological significance in the fulfillment through Jesus Christ."
