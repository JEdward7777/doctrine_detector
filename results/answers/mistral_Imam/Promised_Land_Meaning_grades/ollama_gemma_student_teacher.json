However, it lacks clarity in addressing the specific concern related to God's covenant with Abraham from a Christian worldview. The answer primarily focuses on Islamic interpretations and verses from the Quran, which is relevant but does not fully address the Christian understanding of the Promised Land in relation to Abraham's covenant."
