  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a good explanation of the metaphorical usage of \"Daughter of Zion\" in Christian texts and correctly highlights the importance of interpreting biblical terms within their historical context. However, the answer could have been improved by emphasizing the specific connection between the term and the people of Israel's relationship with God, as indicated in the reference answer provided by the teacher. Overall, a solid response with room for further clarification and focus."
