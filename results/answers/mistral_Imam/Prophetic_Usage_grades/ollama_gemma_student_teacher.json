  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Biblical usage of the term \"Daughter of Zion\" and its metaphorical significance. \n\nThe student correctly highlights the diverse interpretations of the phrase among different denominations and scholars, acknowledging the importance of approaching interpretations with sensitivity and understanding. \n\nThe inclusion of a specific biblical reference (Isaiah 62:6-7) supports the student's argument and demonstrates their ability to support their claims with textual evidence.\n\nHowever, the answer could benefit from a more explicit connection to the Christian worldview by elaborating on the theological significance of the term within Christian teachings."
