The mention of seeking guidance from scholars or religious leaders shows a commendable approach to deepening one's understanding. However, a stronger connection could have been made between recognizing the historical context of the term and its relevance for application in present-day circumstances. Further elaboration on how this historical context influences the interpretation and application of the term could enhance the response."
