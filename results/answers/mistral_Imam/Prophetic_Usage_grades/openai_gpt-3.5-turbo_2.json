The response also demonstrates an understanding of the importance of recognizing the prophetic nature of terms and their historical context to better apply the scriptures today. The only suggested improvement would be to include more specific examples of biblical prophecies where the term is used to enhance the explanation. Overall, a solid response from a Christian worldview perspective."
