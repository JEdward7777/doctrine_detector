It appropriately addresses the concern by acknowledging the prophetic nature of the term and recommending consideration of historical context for applying the scriptures today. The inclusion of advice to consult scholars or religious leaders demonstrates a humble and open-minded approach to interpreting religious texts within a Christian worldview."
