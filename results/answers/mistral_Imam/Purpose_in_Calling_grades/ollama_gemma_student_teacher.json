It provides a clear and practical step-by-step approach based on Islamic principles. The inclusion of Quranic references and the Prophet Muhammad's teachings adds authenticity and relevance to the response. However, the answer would be more aligned with the Christian specific worldview if it included references to prayer, studying Scripture, and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit."
