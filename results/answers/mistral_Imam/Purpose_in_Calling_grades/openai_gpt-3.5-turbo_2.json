The steps outlined align well with seeking clarity and direction in fulfilling God's purpose in life, although the focus is on Allah and Islamic teachings rather than a Christian worldview. Integrating the principles mentioned in the provided answer such as prayer, studying Scripture, and seeking guidance from the Holy Spirit within an Islamic context would enhance the overall alignment with the specified concern from a Christian specific worldview."
