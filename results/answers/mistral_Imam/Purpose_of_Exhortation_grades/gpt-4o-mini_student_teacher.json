  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and insightful answer that aligns closely with the Christian perspective on exhortation according to the New Testament. They effectively highlighted the importance of encouraging believers in their faith, promoting virtuous living, and warning against sinful behavior, supported by a relevant biblical reference. However, the reference answer emphasizes the aspect of persuading others to avoid sin and follow God's will more directly as the primary purpose of exhortation, which the student's response could have emphasized more explicitly. Overall, a strong interpretation based on a Christian worldview."
