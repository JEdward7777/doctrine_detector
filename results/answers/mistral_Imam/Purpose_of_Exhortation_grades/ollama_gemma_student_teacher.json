  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a solid understanding of the primary purpose of exhortation in the New Testament. They accurately identify the main functions of exhortation as encouragement, promotion of virtue, and warning against sin. Additionally, the student provides a relevant textual example from 2 Timothy 4:2 to support their claim. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit explanation of how exhortation aligns with the Christian worldview and ethics."
