  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the concept of exhortation to encouraging believers in their faith journey by referencing relevant biblical passages, specifically highlighting the role of exhortation in correcting, warning against error, and encouraging believers in their walk with God. The explanation is well-supported and aligns with the Christian perspective on the purpose of exhortation. The only room for improvement would be to explicitly tie the concept of exhortation to the broader Christian ethos of love for God and neighbor, which would further enhance the depth of understanding."
