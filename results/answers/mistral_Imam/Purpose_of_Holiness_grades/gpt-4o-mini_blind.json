  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive overview of key principles from the Christian faith on living a holy life set apart for God's purpose. However, the answer lacks a clear acknowledgment of the foundational aspect of salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ as the starting point for living a holy life. The emphasis on personal effort and moral guidelines may suggest a works-based approach rather than a reliance on God's grace. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the importance of repentance and the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification. Encouraging the student to more explicitly tie these principles to the foundational truths of the Christian faith would strengthen the answer."
