  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful answer based on research and understanding of various religious texts, outlining key principles for living a holy life as a Christian. However, the answer focused more on specific actions and practices rather than emphasizing the transformative power of the Holy Spirit in enabling believers to live holy lives. The reference answer highlights the importance of being transformed by the Holy Spirit, which was not explicitly addressed in the student's response. Emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification would have strengthened the student's answer from a Christian worldview perspective."
