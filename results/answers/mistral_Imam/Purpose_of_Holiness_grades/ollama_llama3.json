  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise outline of key principles for living a holy life as a Christian, citing relevant biblical passages to support each point. It covers various aspects of a believer's walk with God, including developing a relationship with God, loving others, obeying God's commands, praying regularly, living in repentance, being a witness for Christ, and growing spiritually.\n\nThe response does an excellent job of addressing the concern about practical application of holiness in a believer's life, providing specific examples and biblical backing to support each principle. The only area for improvement is that some of the points could be more fully developed or illustrated with concrete examples from the Bible or everyday life. Overall, however, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding how Christians can live holy lives."
