 In Islamic tradition, Jesus (peace be upon him) is considered one of the most significant prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity. He was known for his unique way of teaching, often using parables and allegories. The primary purpose of using parables in Jesus's teachings was to convey profound spiritual truths in a simple and relatable manner that could be easily understood by his audience.

Parables allowed Jesus to illustrate complex ideas using familiar, everyday examples that were easy for his listeners to connect with. This made it possible for people of different backgrounds and education levels to grasp the essence of his teachings, thus facilitating spiritual growth and understanding among a diverse audience. By presenting lessons in this manner, he was able to effectively communicate divine wisdom while also stimulating critical thinking and introspection.

In Islamic texts, such as Hadith and Quran, Jesus's use of parables is highly praised, as it demonstrated his extraordinary intelligence, deep insight, and compassion for humanity. It is said that the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) followed in the footsteps of Jesus when it came to teaching through parables, using similar techniques to impart wisdom to his own followers.

Therefore, the primary purpose of Jesus using parables in his teachings was to make profound spiritual truths accessible and relatable for all people, thereby facilitating their spiritual growth and understanding.
