However, the answer did not align with a Christian worldview that emphasizes Jesus as the Son of God and the unique significance of his teachings. The response also did not address the fundamental Christian beliefs surrounding Jesus's parables, such as their role in highlighting the mysteries of the kingdom of God and inviting listeners to deeper faith and understanding. In a Christian context, it is essential to emphasize Jesus's divinity and the redemptive purpose of his teachings through parables."
