  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-written response about the significance of Jesus using parables in Islamic tradition, highlighting their accessibility and relatability for teaching profound spiritual truths. However, the student's answer did not directly address the Christian perspective on the primary purpose of Jesus using parables, which is to reveal truth to his disciples while concealing it from those who do not believe. Additionally, the focus on Islamic texts and the comparison with Prophet Muhammad deviates from the concern of understanding Jesus's teaching methods within a Christian worldview. Overall, while the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the use of parables in religious teachings, the lack of alignment with the Christian perspective results in a grade of 70."
