However, it does not specifically address the concern about understanding the teaching methods of Jesus and their implications for faith.\n\nThe response is also somewhat lacking in its focus on biblical teachings, as it primarily references Islamic texts (Hadith and Quran) and traditions. While this provides some interesting insights into the importance of parables in Islamic thought, it does not directly engage with the Christian perspective or the concern about Jesus's teaching methods.\n\nTo improve, the response could benefit from a more explicit discussion of biblical teachings on Jesus's use of parables and their implications for faith. The response should also aim to provide more direct connections between Jesus's teaching methods and his message, as well as explore how this relates to Christian theology and practice."
