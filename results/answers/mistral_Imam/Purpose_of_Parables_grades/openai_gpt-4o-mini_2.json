It shows a good understanding of Jesus's teaching methods and their implications for faith, staying relevant to the given answer and concern. The Christian worldview would also recognize the importance of using parables to convey spiritual truths effectively to different audiences. However, there could be more emphasis on the unique role of Jesus as the Son of God in conveying divine wisdom through parables, which would enhance the Christian perspective in this context."
