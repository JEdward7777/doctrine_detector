  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the student provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic belief regarding the soul's role in relation to God and how it influences a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions, the focus of the question was on scripture. The answer does not explicitly reference specific scriptures in the Quran to support the points made. Additionally, the answer does not directly address the concern provided by the teacher. The student could improve by incorporating more direct scriptural references and aligning the response more closely with the concern given."
