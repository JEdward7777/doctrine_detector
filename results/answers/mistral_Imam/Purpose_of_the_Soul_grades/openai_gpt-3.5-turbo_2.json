It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing how recognizing the soul's role in relation to God can impact a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. The inclusion of relevant Quranic references and Islamic concepts enriches the explanation. Overall, a strong and well-rounded response from an Islamic worldview."
