It effectively addresses the concern by demonstrating how the recognition of the soul's role in relation to God can indeed influence a believer's spiritual life and moral decisions. The integration of Islamic teachings from the Quran and Hadiths strengthens the response from a Christian worldview perspective, emphasizing the significance of the soul's connection with God and the impact on one's faith and conduct."
