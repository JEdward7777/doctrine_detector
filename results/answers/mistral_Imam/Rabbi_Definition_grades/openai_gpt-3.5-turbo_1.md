# Question [Rabbi Definition](../../../questions/Rabbi_Definition.md)
What does the term 'Rabbi' mean in the context of Christian teaching?

# Correct Answer
The term 'Rabbi' literally means 'my master' or 'my teacher' and refers to a Jewish religious teacher, particularly one who teaches God's laws.

# Stated Concern
Understanding the role and significance of rabbinic teaching in the New Testament.

# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Christian teaching, the term "Rabbi" is an honorific title meaning teacher or master, particularly one who teaches Jewish Law and traditions. In Judaism, it has a similar meaning. Jesus was often referred to as Rabbi by his disciples, indicating that he was their teacher and spiritual guide. It's important to note that the usage of this term doesn't imply a deity or divine nature in the Christian context, unlike how God (Allah) is referred to in Islamic teachings. In Islam, "Rab" means "The Lord" or "The Sustainer."
