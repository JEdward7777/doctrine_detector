## [Answer](../Rabbi_Definition.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Christian teaching, the term "Rabbi" is an honorific title meaning teacher or master, particularly one who teaches Jewish Law and traditions. In Judaism, it has a similar meaning. Jesus was often referred to as Rabbi by his disciples, indicating that he was their teacher and spiritual guide. It's important to note that the usage of this term doesn't imply a deity or divine nature in the Christian context, unlike how God (Allah) is referred to in Islamic teachings. In Islam, "Rab" means "The Lord" or "The Sustainer."
