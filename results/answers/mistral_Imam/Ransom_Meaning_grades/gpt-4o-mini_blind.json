However, it lacks depth in explaining the theological significance of Jesus as a ransom and its connection to Christian beliefs about salvation. Additionally, while it briefly mentions the Islamic perspective on Jesus, it could have further elaborated on the stark contrasts between Christian and Islamic views regarding Jesus' sacrificial role. Further clarification and expansion on the doctrinal implications would have strengthened the answer."
