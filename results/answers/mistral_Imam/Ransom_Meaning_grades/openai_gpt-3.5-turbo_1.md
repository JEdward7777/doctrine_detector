# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold personal beliefs or affiliations. However, I can provide you with information about the concept of Jesus (called 'Isa' in Arabic) being referred to as a ransom in Christianity, based on your question.

In Christian theology, Jesus is often depicted as a sacrifice who paid the price for human sin by dying on the cross. This belief is derived from the New Testament passages such as Mark 10:45 ("For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many") and 1 Timothy 2:6 ("who gave himself as a ransom for all...").

The idea of Jesus as a ransom can be understood in the context of redemption. In this view, humans were held captive by sin, which had estranged them from God. Jesus' death on the cross is seen as a payment that freed people from the penalty of their sins, restoring their relationship with God. This concept is symbolic and varies in interpretation among different Christian denominations.

In Islamic teachings, Jesus (peace be upon him) is considered a prophet sent by Allah to guide humanity. Muslims believe that Jesus did not die on the cross but was raised to heaven before his crucifixion. The beliefs about Jesus' role as a ransom are unique to Christianity and not shared in Islam.
