## [Answer](../Rebuilding_the_Temple.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic history, the events surrounding the destruction and rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem are significant, as they are intertwined with key moments in both Jewish and Islamic tradition. Here's a summary based on historical accounts:

1. First Temple (circa 1000-586 BCE): The First Temple was built under the leadership of King Solomon (970-931 BCE) and stood for approximately 410 years until its destruction by Nebuchadnezzar II, the Babylonian king, in 586 BCE. This event is known as the Babylonian Captivity.

2. Second Temple (circa 515-70 CE): After the Persians defeated the Babylonians, the Jews were allowed to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their temple under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah (458 BCE). The Second Temple was completed in 516 BCE.

3. Destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans: The Second Temple stood for over four centuries until it was destroyed by the Roman Empire in 70 CE during the First Jewish-Roman War, led by General Titus. This event is known as the Siege of Jerusalem and occurred in 70 CE.

4. Herod's rebuilding efforts: Prior to its destruction, King Herod the Great extensively renovated and expanded the Second Temple complex during his reign (37 BCE - 4 BCE), significantly enhancing its size and beauty. Although Herod's reconstruction did not survive the Roman siege, many of the architectural elements he introduced are still considered to be part of the original design of the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount today.

5. Muslim conquest and rebuilding: After the death of Muhammad in 632 CE, his followers continued to expand their territories, reaching Jerusalem in 638 CE under the Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab. During this time, the Muslim conquerors allowed Jews to return to Jerusalem and worship at the remnants of the Second Temple site. Under the Umayyad Caliphs, the Dome of the Rock was built between 687 CE and 691 CE, followed by the construction of Al-Aqsa Mosque a few years later (705-715 CE). These two Islamic structures were built on top of what remained of the Second Temple Mount.

In summary, the Second Temple in Jerusalem was initially destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BCE and later rebuilt but subsequently destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. After the Muslim conquest, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque were built on top of the remnants of the Temple Mount site, marking the beginning of Islamic rule over Jerusalem.
