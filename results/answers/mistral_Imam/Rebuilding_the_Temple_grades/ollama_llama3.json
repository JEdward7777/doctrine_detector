  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides some historical information about the Second Temple, but it lacks depth and detail. It does not accurately reflect the complexity of the events surrounding the temple's destruction and restoration, which are nuanced and multifaceted. Additionally, the response does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the historical context and significance of these events."
