## Question [Redemption Concept](../../../questions/Redemption_Concept.md)
How does the concept of redemption in the Bible compare to the practice of redeeming people or property in ancient Israel?

## Correct Answer
In the Bible, redemption refers to the act of Jesus paying the price for human sins, similar to how a redeemer would buy back a person in slavery or land sold away. Both concepts involve restoring freedom or ownership, reflecting God's desire to free us from sin.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of redemption in Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Redemption_Concept.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In both the Bible (Tawrat, Injil) and the practices of ancient Israel, the concept of redemption plays a significant role. However, it's essential to clarify that the Islamic perspective is not directly based on the Bible but rather on the Quran and the Sunnah.

In the Biblical context, redemption often refers to the act of buying back or releasing someone or something from slavery or debt. This concept can be found in Leviticus 25:25-26, where it is explained that if a brother becomes poor and sells some of his property, it may be redeemed by his relatives or him, depending on the circumstances.

Similarly, in ancient Israel, people could become enslaved due to debt or poverty, but they had the opportunity to be redeemed through various means. In Exodus 21:8, for example, it is mentioned that if a Hebrew man or woman was sold as a slave, they would serve six years and then be released in the seventh year.

In both cases, redemption represents the idea of restoring freedom, dignity, and rights to individuals or property, often under specific conditions and circumstances. This concept is also linked to the Biblical theme of God's compassion and mercy towards His people, who are seen as slaves redeemed by their Creator (Deuteronomy 7:8).

In contrast, while Islam shares some values with Judaism and Christianity regarding compassion and mercy, the Islamic perspective on redemption is distinct. In Islam, all humans are inherently equal in the sight of God, and there is no concept of original sin or need for redemption through a savior (as found in Christianity). Instead, Muslims believe that through faith, good deeds, and obedience to God's commands, they can strive for salvation and eternal life.

In Islamic jurisprudence, the practice of redeeming people or property is still relevant in certain contexts, particularly regarding captives of war (as prescribed by the Quran in Surah Al-Anfal: verses 65 to 73). However, the modern understanding and application of these practices are subject to ongoing interpretation and debate among Islamic scholars.

Grade: 60

Comment: The answer provides a basic comparison between the concept of redemption in the Bible and the practice of redeeming people in ancient Israel. It correctly outlines how redemption involves buying back or releasing someone from slavery or debt in both contexts. However, the answer lacks depth in exploring the theological significance of redemption in the Bible, particularly in relation to Christ's redemptive work on the cross. Additionally, the student could have further elaborated on the differences in the understanding of redemption between Christianity and Islam, emphasizing the unique Christian belief in redemption through Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior. The response would benefit from a stronger theological analysis and clarity on the redemptive work of Christ in Christian doctrine.
