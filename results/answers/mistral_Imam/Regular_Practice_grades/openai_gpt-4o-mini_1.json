However, from a Christian worldview perspective, there is a slight misrepresentation in attributing the establishment of the Lord's Supper solely to the apostle Paul. While Paul did emphasize its importance in his teachings, it was actually Jesus who instituted the Lord's Supper during the Last Supper, as recorded in the Gospels. This detail is significant in understanding the Christian significance of the practice. Further clarity and accuracy on this point would have strengthened the response."
