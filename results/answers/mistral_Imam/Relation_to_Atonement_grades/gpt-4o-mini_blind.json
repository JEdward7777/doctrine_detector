However, the explanation lacks depth and clarity regarding the doctrinal differences between the Christian understanding of propitiation through Christ's sacrifice and the Islamic belief in Allah's mercy. Additionally, the answer could benefit from more scripture references and a clearer emphasis on the uniqueness of Christ's role in Christian atonement."
