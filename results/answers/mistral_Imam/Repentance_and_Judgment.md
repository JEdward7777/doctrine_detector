## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic perspective, as I am an Imam and not a Christian scholar, I will quote verses from the Bible that Muslims believe are authentic and relevant to your question based on common Islamic-Christian interpretations.

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ's teachings emphasize repentance as a path towards reconciliation with God. In Matthew 4:17, Jesus begins His ministry by proclaiming, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." This call to repentance is not about appeasing an angry deity but rather a divine invitation to return to the original purpose and guidance of God.

Regarding the wrath of God, it's important to consider verses that convey His infinite mercy, love, and patience. For example, in Romans 2:4, it is written, "Do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that Godâ€™s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?" This verse suggests that God's kindness, mercy, and patience are intended to move people towards repentance rather than inducing fear or wrath.

In addition, the story of Jonah in the Old Testament demonstrates the nature of God's wrath and forgiveness. When Nineveh repented after Jonah warned them about God's impending judgment (Jonah 3:5-10), God showed mercy to the city and did not bring destruction upon it. This story illustrates that repentance can turn away God's wrath and lead to forgiveness.

However, interpretations of these verses may vary among Christian denominations, and it is essential to approach Bible study with an open mind and heart, as well as in the context of Islamic belief systems. It is always important to engage in respectful dialogue and exchange ideas based on common ground and mutual understanding.
