  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60/100\n\nComment: The response attempts to address the relationship between repentance and the wrath of God from an Islamic perspective while referencing Christian scriptures. However, the focus should have been on articulating a Christian perspective on the topic rather than blending Islamic and Christian interpretations. The answer lacks doctrinal clarity and may cause confusion regarding Christian beliefs on repentance and God's wrath. Focusing more on accurately presenting Christian teachings would improve the grade significantly."
