The answer lacks a clear emphasis on the necessity of repentance in Christianity as a response to sin and God's righteous judgment. The Biblical references provided are relevant, but the focus should have been on how repentance plays a pivotal role in avoiding God's wrath and receiving His mercy according to Christian beliefs."
