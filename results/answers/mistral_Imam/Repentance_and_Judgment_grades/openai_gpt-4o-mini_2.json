However, the response primarily focuses on Islamic-Christian interpretations and does not directly address the concern regarding the centrality of repentance in the Christian worldview. While it is valuable to explore common ground between different faith traditions, it is important to provide a more direct and thorough explanation from a Christian perspective on the significance of repentance in relation to God's judgment and mercy."
