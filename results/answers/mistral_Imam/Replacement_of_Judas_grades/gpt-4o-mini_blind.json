  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles in Christian belief. The inclusion of the Acts of the Apostles reference adds credibility to the answer. The student also appropriately contrasts Christian beliefs with Islamic beliefs regarding apostles and prophets. However, to improve the grade, the response could further elaborate on the significance of Matthias's selection in the context of the early Christian Church."
