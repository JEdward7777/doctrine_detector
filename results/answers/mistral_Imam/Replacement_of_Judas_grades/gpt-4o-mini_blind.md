## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Christian belief, Jesus chose Matthias as the twelfth apostle after Judas Iscariot's betrayal and suicide. This event is narrated in the Acts of the Apostles (1:21-26). However, it is important to note that this story does not have a direct parallel in Islamic tradition since the concept of apostles is specific to Christianity. In Islam, the prophets are considered to be messengers of Allah, and Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger.

## Grade by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles in Christian belief. The inclusion of the Acts of the Apostles reference adds credibility to the answer. The student also appropriately contrasts Christian beliefs with Islamic beliefs regarding apostles and prophets. However, to improve the grade, the response could further elaborate on the significance of Matthias's selection in the context of the early Christian Church.
