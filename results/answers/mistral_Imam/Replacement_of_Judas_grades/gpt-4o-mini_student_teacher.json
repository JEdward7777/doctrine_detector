However, the answer did not directly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, which is important in understanding the significance of Matthias' selection. Encouraging the student to connect the event of Matthias' appointment to the broader theme of apostolic succession in Christian tradition would enhance the response."
