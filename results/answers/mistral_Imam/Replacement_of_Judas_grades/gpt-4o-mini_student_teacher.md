## Question [Replacement of Judas](../../../questions/Replacement_of_Judas.md)
Who was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles?

## Correct Answer
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after Judas' betrayal and subsequent death.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.

## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Christian belief, Jesus chose Matthias as the twelfth apostle after Judas Iscariot's betrayal and suicide. This event is narrated in the Acts of the Apostles (1:21-26). However, it is important to note that this story does not have a direct parallel in Islamic tradition since the concept of apostles is specific to Christianity. In Islam, the prophets are considered to be messengers of Allah, and Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger.

Grade: 85

Comment: The student provided a correct answer regarding Matthias being chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles in Christian belief. However, the answer did not directly address the concern of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension, which is important in understanding the significance of Matthias' selection. Encouraging the student to connect the event of Matthias' appointment to the broader theme of apostolic succession in Christian tradition would enhance the response.
