## Correct Answer

Recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.

## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Christian belief, Jesus chose Matthias as the twelfth apostle after Judas Iscariot's betrayal and suicide. This event is narrated in the Acts of the Apostles (1:21-26). However, it is important to note that this story does not have a direct parallel in Islamic tradition since the concept of apostles is specific to Christianity. In Islam, the prophets are considered to be messengers of Allah, and Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger.
