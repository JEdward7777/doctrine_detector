  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The response does mention Matthias being chosen to replace Judas, which is accurate according to Christian tradition.\n* It also provides some biblical basis for this event by referencing Acts 1:21-26, which shows an understanding of the relevant scripture.\n* However, the response could be improved in terms of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While it mentions Matthias being chosen as the twelfth apostle, it doesn't explicitly connect this to the overall theme of maintaining apostolic leadership and authority.\n\nThe concern is partially addressed, but there's room for more development on this topic. Overall, I would give this response a solid 80, recognizing that it provides some accurate information and scripture-based understanding, while leaving some opportunity for further insight into the continuity of apostolic leadership."
