## Question [Replacement of Judas](../../../questions/Replacement_of_Judas.md)
Who was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot among the twelve apostles?

## Correct Answer
Matthias was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot after Judas' betrayal and subsequent death.

## Stated Concern
Recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension.

## [Answer](../Replacement_of_Judas.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Christian belief, Jesus chose Matthias as the twelfth apostle after Judas Iscariot's betrayal and suicide. This event is narrated in the Acts of the Apostles (1:21-26). However, it is important to note that this story does not have a direct parallel in Islamic tradition since the concept of apostles is specific to Christianity. In Islam, the prophets are considered to be messengers of Allah, and Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

Here's why:

* The response does mention Matthias being chosen to replace Judas, which is accurate according to Christian tradition.
* It also provides some biblical basis for this event by referencing Acts 1:21-26, which shows an understanding of the relevant scripture.
* However, the response could be improved in terms of recognizing the continuity of apostolic leadership after Jesus' ascension. While it mentions Matthias being chosen as the twelfth apostle, it doesn't explicitly connect this to the overall theme of maintaining apostolic leadership and authority.

The concern is partially addressed, but there's room for more development on this topic. Overall, I would give this response a solid 80, recognizing that it provides some accurate information and scripture-based understanding, while leaving some opportunity for further insight into the continuity of apostolic leadership.
