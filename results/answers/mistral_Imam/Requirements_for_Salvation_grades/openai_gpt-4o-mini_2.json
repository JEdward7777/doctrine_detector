However, the inclusion of information about Islam's perspective on salvation, while informative, may have shifted the focus away from the Christian-specific worldview. It would have been stronger if the response had delved deeper into the Christian teachings and perhaps provided more scriptural references to support the concept of repentance and belief in Jesus for salvation."
