## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim Imam, I would like to clarify that the Bible narrates events that are not directly related to Islam. The story of Peter addressing the crowd regarding the crucifixion is found in the New Testament of the Bible, specifically in the Gospel according to Luke (23:34).

In this account, as Jesus was being crucified, he said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." This was a direct address by Jesus towards the crowd that had gathered to witness and participate in his execution. Peter was present at this event but did not directly address the crowd about their role.

It is essential to understand that these narratives are part of the Christian faith and should be interpreted within that context, as Muslims believe in different prophets and scriptures. The Quran, our primary source of guidance, does not contain any verses specifically addressing this incident.
