However, there is a lack of engagement with the specific question about Peter's address to the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. Additionally, the response focuses more on clarifying the differences between Islam and Christianity rather than providing an analysis from a Christian perspective. A deeper examination of Peter's role and his message to the crowd would have strengthened the answer."
