  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's answer does not address the specific question about how Peter addressed the crowd regarding their role in the crucifixion. It primarily focuses on providing a Muslim perspective and explaining the context of the event rather than analyzing Peter's speech and its implications. The student should engage more directly with the Christian worldview and the content of Peter's message for a higher grade."
