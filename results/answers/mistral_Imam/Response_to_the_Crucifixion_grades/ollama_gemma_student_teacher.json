  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 75\n\n**Comments:**\n\nWhile the student provides a thorough explanation of the lack of direct involvement by Peter in addressing the crowd concerning the crucifixion from a Muslim perspective, the response lacks engagement with the provided concern about evaluating the early church's preaching and the call to respond to the gospel. The response could have elaborated on how Peter's actions and sermons might have influenced the early church's preaching and the call to faith in the context of the gospel."
