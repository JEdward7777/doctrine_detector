While the response mentions Peter's presence at the event, it does not engage with the idea of Peter's role in preaching or the crowd's response to Jesus' message. The focus on clarifying that the narrative is part of the Christian faith and understanding its context within Christianity is relevant but does not directly address the concern.\n\nThe target answer provides a more nuanced evaluation of the early church's preaching, highlighting Peter's emphasis on repentance and faith in response to Jesus' crucifixion. To improve this response, it would be helpful to incorporate more analysis of the biblical passage and its implications for understanding the call to respond to the gospel."
