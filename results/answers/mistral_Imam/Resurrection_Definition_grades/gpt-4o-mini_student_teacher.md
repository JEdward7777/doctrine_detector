## Stated Concern
Understanding the fundamental concept of resurrection is crucial for comprehension of Christian beliefs about life after death.

## [Answer](../Resurrection_Definition.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In a Christian context, the term "Resurrection" refers to the belief that Jesus Christ, after his crucifixion and death, was miraculously raised from the dead on the third day by the power of God. This event is considered a central tenet of Christianity and a fundamental part of its faith. It is seen as proof of Jesus' divinity and redemption for humanity's sins. In Islam, the concept of resurrection also exists but it is based on the belief in the Day of Judgment (Qiyamah), when all humans will be raised from their graves to stand before Allah and be judged according to their deeds in life.
