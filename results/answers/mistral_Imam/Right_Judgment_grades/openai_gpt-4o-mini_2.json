However, the concern raised is about promoting a spirit of grace within Christian communities, and the response does not specifically address this aspect from a Christian worldview. It would have been beneficial to include more explicit references to Christian teachings on grace, forgiveness, and the importance of avoiding judgment in the context of Christian beliefs."
