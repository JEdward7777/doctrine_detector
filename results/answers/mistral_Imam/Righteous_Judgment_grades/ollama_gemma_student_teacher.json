They effectively cite biblical passages and traditional Christian theology to support their arguments. The response also acknowledges the complexity of God's character and offers a balanced perspective on the issue. However, the answer could benefit from additional elaboration on the specific mechanisms through which God's wrath and love coexist in his actions towards humanity."
