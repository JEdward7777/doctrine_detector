It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the relationship between God's justice and holiness in maintaining righteousness, while also emphasizing His love and mercy extended through salvation and forgiveness. The integration of scriptural references and theological concepts enhances the coherence and depth of the explanation within a Christian worldview."
