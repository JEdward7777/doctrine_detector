  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by explaining how God's attributes of wrath, love, and mercy coexist without contradiction in Christian teaching. It provides a thorough and balanced perspective by emphasizing the importance of considering both aspects of God's character as revealed in the Bible and traditional theology. The connection to God's justice, holiness, and the offer of salvation for repentant believers is well articulated. The only minor critique would be to further elaborate on specific biblical passages or theological principles to support the explanation, which would strengthen the overall argument."
