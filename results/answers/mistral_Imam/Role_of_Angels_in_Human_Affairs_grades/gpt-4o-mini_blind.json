  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive overview of how angels serve God according to both Islamic and biblical references. While the content is well-researched and covers various aspects of angelic roles, the grade is lower due to the inclusion of Islamic beliefs alongside biblical references. From a Christian worldview, it is important to prioritize doctrinal correctness and focus solely on biblical references when discussing angels and their roles in serving God. Additionally, some points could be further elaborated or supported with additional scriptural references to strengthen the argument."
