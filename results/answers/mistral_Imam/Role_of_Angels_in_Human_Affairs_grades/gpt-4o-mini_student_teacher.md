## [Answer](../Role_of_Angels_in_Human_Affairs.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 According to Islamic and biblical references, angels serve God in various ways:

1. Recording Human Actions (Malakut al-A'aza): Angels are responsible for recording every human action, thought, word, and deed in the "Preserved Tablet" (Lawh Al-Mahfuz) or "Book of Deeds" (Sahifat al-Sachwa). This is based on the Quranic verses 80:12-16 and the Bible's Book of Revelation 5:1-4.

2. Guarding and Protecting: Angels are assigned to protect and guard individuals, as mentioned in Quran 91:4-10. In biblical references (Psalm 91:11), angels are referred to as God's shield or protection for those who take refuge in Him.

3. Carrying out God's Judgments: Angels execute God's decisions, such as punishing the wicked and rewarding the righteous (Quran 6:60; Revelation 14:15-20). They also announce God's messages to His prophets or messengers, like Gabriel communicating with Mary about the birth of Jesus in the Quran 3:42-51 and the Bible (Luke 1:26-38).

4. Maintaining Order in the Universe: Angels serve as God's administrators, maintaining the order and balance in the universe. This includes regulating natural phenomena such as weather patterns and growth (Quran 7:54; 21:30).

5. Worshipping God: The primary role of angels is to worship God day and night without interruption, as mentioned in Quran 35:1, 38:72-76, and Bible's Revelation 4:11. This is an example for believers on how they should constantly remember and devote themselves to God.

6. Acting as Intermediaries: In some instances, angels may act as intermediaries between God and humanity (Quran 2:98). They also act as messengers of divine guidance to prophets or serve as symbols of God's presence, such as the angel Gabriel (Jibril) in Islam and Archangel Michael in Christianity.

7. Assisting in the Creation of the Universe: Angels played a role in creating the heavens and earth during the initial stages of creation, as mentioned in Quran 38:71-72 and Bible's Job 38:4-7.
