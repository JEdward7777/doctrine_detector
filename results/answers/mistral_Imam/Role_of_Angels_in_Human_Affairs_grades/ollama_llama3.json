The response focuses mainly on the functions mentioned in point 2 (Guarding and Protecting) and 6 (Acting as Intermediaries), without fully exploring the other responsibilities of angels mentioned in the passage.\n\nThe concern about how Christians perceive divine intervention in their lives is also not adequately addressed, with only a brief mention of angels providing protection. The response could benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of the various roles of angels and how they relate to Christian understanding of God's involvement in human life."
