  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided valuable insights from an Islamic perspective, the response did not directly address the concern about understanding teaching and community as integral aspects of church life as modeled by the apostles. The student's answer focused more on general virtues and moral lessons to be learned rather than specifically addressing the actions and approach of the apostles in fostering community among believers. The student should have connected the provided Islamic teachings to Christian principles and practices exemplified by the apostles for a more relevant response."
