  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The answer provides a good overview of key principles from the New Testament on how Christians are called to fulfill their roles within the church. The student effectively addresses concepts such as servant leadership, using spiritual gifts, faithfulness, love, holiness, and sharing the Gospel message. However, the answer could have been strengthened by emphasizing the importance of doctrinal purity, adherence to biblical authority, and the role of Christ as the head of the church. Additionally, a deeper exploration of the sacramental aspects of Christian ministry and the significance of the Church as the Body of Christ could have enhanced the response. Overall, a solid foundation is presented, but further development and depth would elevate the grade."
