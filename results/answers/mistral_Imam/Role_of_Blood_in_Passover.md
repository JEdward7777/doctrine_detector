## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic scholarship, we respect and study other religious texts such as the Bible to gain a deeper understanding of the monotheistic traditions and the common roots they share. The story of Passover, found in the Book of Exodus, is indeed significant in Jewish tradition.

Regarding the question about the blood in the Passover event: In the story, God commanded the Israelites to mark their doors with the blood of a lamb so that the Angel of Death would pass over their homes, sparing the firstborn sons from death (Exodus 12). This act symbolized the protective covenant between God and the Israelites. The blood served as a sign of faith and obedience, demonstrating the people's willingness to follow God's commands and be protected under His mercy.

It is essential to note that as Muslims, we believe in the Prophets mentioned in the Bible, including Moses, but our faith is based on the Quran and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). We also recognize that there are significant differences between Islamic and Jewish practices due to various historical and cultural factors.

In Islam, the concept of sacrifice is present in the story of Abraham (Ibrahim) and his son Ismail (Ishmael), which emphasizes unwavering obedience to God's commands. Muslims commemorate this event during the annual Hajj pilgrimage. The Islamic practice of slaughtering an animal during Eid al-Adha is rooted in this story as well, although it carries slightly different symbolism and significance.

In conclusion, while the blood in the Passover event is a significant symbol of faith and God's protection in Judaism, Muslims find similarities in themes like sacrifice and obedience to God in their own religious practices.
