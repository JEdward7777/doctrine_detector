## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I do not interpret the Bible in the same way as a Christian would. However, it is important to note that within Christianity, there are different denominations and interpretations of various texts, including those related to the role of Jesus (Isa in Islam) in our salvation.

In general, the New Testament presents Jesus as the Messiah, the son of God, and the Savior of humanity. In some Christian traditions, this is understood as Jesus taking on the sins of humanity and redeeming them through his crucifixion and resurrection. This belief is rooted in passages like John 3:16-17, where Jesus is described as dying for the world's sins so that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.

However, it is crucial to remember that Muslims believe that Jesus (Isa) was a prophet of God and not the son of God, as we reject the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. Furthermore, Muslims do not believe that Jesus died on the cross or that he was crucified at all. Instead, in Islamic tradition, it is believed that Jesus was raised to heaven without dying and will return one day to establish justice on earth.

In Islam, salvation comes through faith and good deeds, as described in the Quran (2:62) â€“ "Indeed, the believers who emigrated and fought in the cause of Allah and those who provided them with support - all of them supported by Allah. And it is those who are victorious."

In summary, while there may be some similarities in the descriptions of Jesus' role in our salvation between the Bible and Islamic teachings, they differ significantly due to our understanding of Jesus as a prophet, not God or the Son of God, and our emphasis on good deeds as a means of earning Allah's mercy.
