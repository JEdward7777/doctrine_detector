# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that Prophet Isa (Jesus) is a significant prophet who was sent by Allah to guide the Children of Israel. However, our beliefs about the role of Prophet Isa differ from those in some Christian traditions regarding his messianic status and second coming.

The Quran speaks of Jesus as a Messenger of God, born miraculously to Maryam (Mary), performing miracles, and being raised as a righteous servant of Allah. But Islam does not view him as the son of God or part of a Holy Trinity.

As for the concept of the kingdom, in Islamic teachings, the kingdom belongs exclusively to Allah. It is not something that Prophet Isa or any other prophet will rule over in a worldly sense. Instead, Jesus' role, like that of all prophets, is spiritual guidance and submission to Allah.

In Surah Al-Imran (3:45-46), the Quran states: "And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: 'O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Torah which came before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger who will come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.' But when he (Jesus) brought them proofs, they said: 'This is nothing but evident sorcery!'"

So, while Jesus plays a crucial role in Islamic teachings, his connection to the concept of the kingdom is not about worldly rule or government but rather spiritual guidance and submission to Allah.

Grade: 50

Comment: The response provided a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Prophet Isa (Jesus) and his role in Islamic teachings. However, there was no engagement or acknowledgment of the importance of Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah in God's plan for humanity, as indicated in the given answer. In a Christian worldview, recognizing Jesus' divinity and messianic role as central to God's plan for salvation is crucial. Therefore, the response lacks a critical element in addressing the concern provided.
