  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The response correctly asserts Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who fulfills the prophecy of ruling God's kingdom with righteousness. However, the concern regarding recognizing the importance of Jesus' role in God's plan for humanity is not directly addressed in the provided response, which primarily focuses on contrasting Islamic beliefs about Prophet Isa (Jesus). The graded response could have further emphasized the unique and central role of Jesus in Christian theology as the Savior and King."
