  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: While the response accurately presents Islamic beliefs about Prophet Isa (Jesus) and his role in Islam, it falls short in addressing the Christian-specific concern of Jesus as the Son of God and the Messiah who will rule over God's kingdom with righteousness. The importance of Jesus' unique role in God's plan for humanity is not fully recognized or acknowledged in the response, leading to a lower grade."
