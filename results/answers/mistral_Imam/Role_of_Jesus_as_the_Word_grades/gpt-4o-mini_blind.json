  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The answer provides a solid explanation of the title \"The Word of God\" ascribed to Jesus in Christianity, emphasizing His divine nature as the second person of the Holy Trinity. The inclusion of key biblical references, such as John 1:1-18, strengthens the doctrinal correctness of the response. The explanation of Jesus' role as the revealer of God's will, creator of all things, and the redeemer of humanity demonstrates a good understanding of this aspect of Christian theology. Some additional depth or insights could enhance the answer further."
