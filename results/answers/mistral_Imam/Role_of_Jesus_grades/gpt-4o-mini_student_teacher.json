  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student has provided a detailed comparison between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus and salvation, which shows an understanding of different perspectives. However, the student's answer does not focus enough on the Christian view of Jesus' role in salvation as described in the Bible. The answer lacks emphasis on Jesus as the Savior who offers forgiveness and deliverance through belief in Him, which is central to Christian doctrine. To improve the grade, the student should include more specific references to the Bible and the unique Christian understanding of Jesus' role in salvation."
