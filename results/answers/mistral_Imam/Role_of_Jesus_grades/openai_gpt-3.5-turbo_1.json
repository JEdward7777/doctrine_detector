It addresses the concern by discussing Jesus' role in salvation according to Christian beliefs, but it falls short in fully clarifying why Jesus is central for redemption according to the Bible from a Christian worldview. More emphasis on the unique sacrificial aspect of Jesus' death and resurrection for the atonement of sin would have improved the response."
