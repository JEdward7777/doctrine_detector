## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the Islamic perspective on this matter as it is stated in the Quran and Hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him). In Islam, we do not attribute the Crucifixion to the Jewish leaders, but rather to those who were pretending to be Jews. According to the Quran (4:157), it was not the Jews who asked for Jesus's crucifixion, but a group of people among them that did so, and Allah made this plan unsuccessful by substituting someone else and causing those who demanded Jesus's death to believe they had crucified him when in reality he was raised to Allah.

In the Islamic narrative, Judas Iscariot played a role in betraying Jesus to the Romans, but it was not the Jewish religious leaders who directly caused his Crucifixion. Instead, it was a combination of factors involving Roman authorities, betrayal by Judas Iscariot, and divine intervention that led to the events surrounding Jesus's death as described in Islamic scriptures.

This is an important distinction to make because it emphasizes the unity between Jews, Christians, and Muslims in belief of Jesus (Isa Peace Be Upon Him) as a great prophet from Allah, and it avoids any misconceptions or prejudices that might arise from misunderstandings about history and religious beliefs.
