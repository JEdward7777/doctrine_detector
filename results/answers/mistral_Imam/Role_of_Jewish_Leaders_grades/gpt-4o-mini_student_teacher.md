## Question [Role of Jewish Leaders](../../../questions/Role_of_Jewish_Leaders.md)
How did the Jewish religious leaders influence the crucifixion of Jesus?

## Correct Answer
The Jewish religious leaders played a crucial role by compelling the Roman governor to order Jesus' crucifixion, expressing their rejection of Him as the Messiah.

## Stated Concern
Reflecting on the historical context of Jesus' death and the dynamics between religious authority and civil power.

## [Answer](../Role_of_Jewish_Leaders.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the Islamic perspective on this matter as it is stated in the Quran and Hadiths (sayings of Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him). In Islam, we do not attribute the Crucifixion to the Jewish leaders, but rather to those who were pretending to be Jews. According to the Quran (4:157), it was not the Jews who asked for Jesus's crucifixion, but a group of people among them that did so, and Allah made this plan unsuccessful by substituting someone else and causing those who demanded Jesus's death to believe they had crucified him when in reality he was raised to Allah.

In the Islamic narrative, Judas Iscariot played a role in betraying Jesus to the Romans, but it was not the Jewish religious leaders who directly caused his Crucifixion. Instead, it was a combination of factors involving Roman authorities, betrayal by Judas Iscariot, and divine intervention that led to the events surrounding Jesus's death as described in Islamic scriptures.

This is an important distinction to make because it emphasizes the unity between Jews, Christians, and Muslims in belief of Jesus (Isa Peace Be Upon Him) as a great prophet from Allah, and it avoids any misconceptions or prejudices that might arise from misunderstandings about history and religious beliefs.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student's response is well-articulated from an Islamic perspective, emphasizing the belief in Jesus as a prophet and clarifying the role of certain individuals in the events leading to the crucifixion. However, from a Christian worldview, the Jewish religious leaders did have a significant influence on the crucifixion of Jesus by pressuring the Roman authorities to have Him executed. The student's answer does not directly address this aspect, which is a key component in understanding the dynamics between religious authority and civil power during that historical context.
