However, from a Christian worldview, the Islamic perspective diverges from the biblical narrative regarding the role of the Jewish religious leaders in Jesus' crucifixion. In Christianity, the Jewish religious leaders were primarily responsible for influencing the Roman authorities to crucify Jesus due to their rejection of Him as the Messiah. While acknowledging the attempt to emphasize unity and avoid misunderstandings, the response does not align with the Christian understanding of the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion."
