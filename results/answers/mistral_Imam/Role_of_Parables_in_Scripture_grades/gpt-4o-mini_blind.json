  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a clear and accurate summary of the biblical account involving Prophet Nathan and King David. The answer correctly identifies the context of the parable and its purpose in confronting David's sin. The response could be improved by incorporating more specific biblical references or insights into the theological significance of Nathan's approach, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the narrative."
