 As I am not a Biblical scholar, I would like to clarify that the Prophets in the Bible of Jewish and Christian traditions are different from the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in Islam. However, I can provide you with an example of a prophet who used parables in the Bible, which is Nathan the Prophet as per the Old Testament.

In the Second Book of Samuel (Chapter 12), King David committed adultery with Bathsheba and then orchestrated her husband Uriah's death to cover up his sin. When Nathan, the prophet, confronted David about his actions, he used a parable to reveal the truth without directly accusing him.

Nathan told David a story about two men: one rich and the other poor. The rich man had many sheep and took one from the poor man's flock to prepare a feast for himself. When David was outraged by this fictional injustice, Nathan revealed that the rich man in the parable was him (David), and the ewe lamb was Uriah the Hittite - showing David his own sinfulness and convincing him of the need for repentance.

Through this story, Nathan used a parable to confront King David effectively while preserving the king's dignity and allowing him an opportunity to confess and seek forgiveness for his sins.

Comment: The student provides a clear and accurate summary of the biblical account involving Prophet Nathan and King David. The answer correctly identifies the context of the parable and its purpose in confronting David's sin. The response could be improved by incorporating more specific biblical references or insights into the theological significance of Nathan's approach, but overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the narrative.
