  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the use of parables in biblical narratives, specifically in the story of Nathan confronting King David. The explanation provided is clear, accurate, and insightful, showcasing a solid grasp of how parables were used for correction and revelation in this context. However, a slight improvement could be made by explicitly linking this example to the broader theological significance of parables in communicating spiritual truths and prompting repentance. Overall, a well-thought-out analysis from a Christian worldview."
