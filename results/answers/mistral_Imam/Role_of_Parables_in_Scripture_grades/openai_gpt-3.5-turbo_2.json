The student accurately describes the story from the Second Book of Samuel and explains how Nathan's use of a parable led to David's acknowledgment and repentance. The connection between the biblical narrative and the concern is well-established, showing a strong grasp of the significance of parables in conveying moral lessons and prompting self-reflection."
