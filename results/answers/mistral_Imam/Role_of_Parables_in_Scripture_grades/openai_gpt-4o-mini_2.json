  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response provides a well-articulated and detailed explanation of how the prophet Nathan used a parable to confront King David's sin effectively. The student accurately connects the use of parables as a means of correction and revelation in this biblical narrative, demonstrating a strong understanding of this aspect of biblical teaching. The only suggestion for improvement would be to provide a bit more elaboration on the theological significance or implications of this use of parables in conveying God's message of repentance and forgiveness. Overall, a very insightful and well-supported response."
