  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a thorough and well-researched explanation of the main responsibilities of priests in the Old Testament according to the Bible. They cover various aspects of the priests' roles with detailed references to relevant verses. However, the student's answer includes additional responsibilities beyond what was specified in the reference answer, such as maintaining the Tabernacle or Temple and consecrating leaders, which are not directly related to the main responsibilities of priests. Despite this minor deviation, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical role of priests."
