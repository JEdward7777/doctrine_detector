It is important to emphasize that in a Christian worldview, the role of a prophet is not shared by Prophet Muhammad as mentioned in the Quran. Additionally, the answer could have delved deeper into the aspect of prophets as forthtellers and foretellers, highlighting their call to repentance and pointing towards the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ. Improving the doctrinal accuracy and focusing more on the uniqueness of biblical prophets would strengthen the response."
