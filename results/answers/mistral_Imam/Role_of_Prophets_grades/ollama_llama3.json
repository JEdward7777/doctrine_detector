  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a good overview of the primary role of a prophet, highlighting their responsibility to convey God's message and warn people about impending judgment for disobedience or guide them towards righteousness. However, it could be improved by providing more specific examples from Scripture that support this role. Additionally, while the response mentions the biblical context, it does not fully explore the implications of prophets' messages on individuals' understanding of God's will and their connection with Him.\n\nThe response scores well in terms of understanding the biblical role of prophets and their messages, but could be more detailed and scripturally-based to earn a higher grade."
