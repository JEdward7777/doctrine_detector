The response could be strengthened by elaborating more on how prophets interpret and apply revelations from God, as well as the significance of predicting future events and foretelling the coming of important figures like the Messiah. Additionally, the reference to Prophet Muhammad in the Islamic context may not align entirely with a Christian-specific worldview when discussing the role of prophets as portrayed in the Bible."
