  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the main responsibilities of the Sadducees within the Jewish temple system. They have covered various aspects such as temple administration, law interpretation, priesthood, political influence, and wealth and power. While the additional information enhances the answer, it slightly deviates from the specific focus on the Sadducees' main responsibilities as priestly tasks related to the temple complex. The answer could have been improved by emphasizing and expanding on the performance of priestly duties, such as offering sacrifices, which was a core responsibility of the Sadducees."
