However, it would have been beneficial to delve deeper into the historical context of religious leadership in the time of Jesus, connecting the Sadducees' responsibilities to the broader religious landscape of that era. Further elaboration on how their actions and beliefs interacted with Jesus' teachings and interactions with religious leaders could have strengthened the response."
