# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the context of the Old Testament, scribes played a crucial role in preserving and transmitting sacred texts. They were responsible for copying, reciting, and interpreting the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), which consists of three sections: Torah (Law), Nevi'im (Prophets), and Ketuvim (Writings).

The scribes' responsibilities included accurate transcription, using specialized techniques such as Masoretic Textual Criticism to ensure the integrity of each letter, vowel sign, and word order. This was done meticulously so that the original meaning of the text would not be lost or distorted over time.

Scribes were also responsible for reading the texts aloud during religious services, teaching them to others, and providing authoritative explanations of their meaning. They memorized significant passages, and many even embellished Torah scrolls with decorative elements such as calligraphy and ornamentation.

In addition to their literary duties, scribes acted as religious leaders within Jewish communities, serving as mediators between the people and God, and providing guidance on matters of faith and practice. They were highly respected figures who played a central role in preserving and transmitting the traditions of the Jewish people throughout history.
