  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of the role of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message from both Christian and Muslim perspectives, the student did not directly address the question regarding how the Bible illustrates the use of Scripture in sharing the Gospel message. The student's response lacked a specific example or illustration from the Bible, such as the examples of Philip and Paul, which were provided in the reference answer. Further integration of biblical examples would have strengthened the answer and better addressed the concern provided."
