They included specific examples and references, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, the response also included unnecessary information about Islamic beliefs, which while informative, was not directly relevant to the question at hand. Overall, a solid answer that aligns with a Christian worldview emphasizing the importance of firsthand witness accounts."
