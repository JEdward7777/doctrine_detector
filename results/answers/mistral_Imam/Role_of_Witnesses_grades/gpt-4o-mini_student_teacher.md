## [Answer](../Role_of_Witnesses.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the New Testament, witnesses indeed play a significant role in the story of Jesus' life and resurrection. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all recount various events where eyewitnesses are present.

In the case of Jesus' ministry, His miracles, teachings, and actions were often witnessed by large crowds and specific individuals. For example, in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), a multitude came to hear Him speak, while three specific disciples (Peter, James, and John) were present at His transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-8).

Regarding Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, the New Testament provides several eyewitness accounts. The four Gospels all include a narrative of Jesus' trial before the Sanhedrin and Pilate, His crucifixion, and burial. In each account, there are specific individuals who serve as witnesses to these events.

Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, is mentioned as questioning Jesus, releasing Him to be crucified after finding no fault in Him (Luke 23:4). Among the Jewish leaders who called for His crucifixion were notable figures like Caiaphas, Annas, and the scribes and Pharisees.

On the day of Jesus' resurrection, Mary Magdalene, Peter, and other women are mentioned as the first witnesses to the empty tomb (Matthew 28:1-10, Mark 16:1-8, Luke 24:1-10, John 20:1-10). Later, Jesus appears to His disciples, including Thomas, who famously doubts the resurrection until he physically encounters Jesus (John 20:24-29).

In Islamic belief, the Quran acknowledges Jesus as a prophet and mentions some of his miracles but does not mention the crucifixion or resurrection. This difference in narrative highlights the unique perspectives between Islam and Christianity regarding these events. However, both faiths value the importance of eyewitness accounts and their role in confirming religious truths.

They included specific examples and references, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic.
