  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively discusses the importance of witnesses in the New Testament, highlighting specific events and individuals who were present to testify about Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. It also provides examples from each of the four Gospels, demonstrating a good understanding of the biblical narrative.\n\nHowever, the response falls short of fully addressing the concern of emphasizing the call for Christians to witness their faith and share personal experiences of God's work in their lives. While it does mention the importance of eyewitness accounts, it could be more explicit in applying this concept to modern-day Christian living.\n\nThe addition of a paragraph discussing the difference between Islam and Christianity regarding the crucifixion and resurrection is a nice touch, but it feels somewhat tangential to the main topic of witnesses in the New Testament. Overall, I would give this response an 85, as it demonstrates a good understanding of biblical concepts but could be more explicit in its application to modern-day Christian witness.\n\nComment: To strengthen this response, consider adding more examples or anecdotes from your own life that demonstrate the importance of witnessing one's faith and sharing personal experiences of God's work. This would help bring the concept to life and provide a clearer call to action for readers."
