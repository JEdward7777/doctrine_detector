The inclusion of specific examples from the Gospels demonstrates a strong understanding of the role of eyewitnesses in Christian faith. The response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of Christians sharing their personal experiences of God's work, aligning well with the Christian worldview. Great job!"
