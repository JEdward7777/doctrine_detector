## [Answer](../Role_of_the_High_Priest.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Jewish tradition, the High Priest (Kohen Gadol) had distinct roles and responsibilities that set him apart from other priests, as outlined in the Hebrew Bible. Here are some of those unique responsibilities:

1. Performing specific Temple duties: The High Priest was responsible for performing certain rituals in the Holy Temple, such as the Yom Kippur service (the Day of Atonement), and the daily offering of incense and a sin-offering on the annual festivals.

2. Wearing special garments: The High Priest wore special, ornate, and highly symbolic clothing during his service in the Temple. This included a breastplate (Hoshen Mishpat), a turban (Mitznefet), and an ephod.

3. Officiating Yom Kippur: On Yom Kippur, the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies once a year to make atonement for the sins of the Jewish people by sprinkling the blood of the sacrifice on the Ark of the Covenant (the Akeidah).

4. Marital restrictions: The High Priest was required to be married and had specific restrictions regarding marrying divorced women, widows, or childless women. He also needed to maintain a certain level of purity within his family lineage.

5. Levitical descent: Only a male descendant from the Aaronite line (a sub-group of the tribe of Levi) could serve as the High Priest. This is in contrast to other priests, who could be from any of the three main families of Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

6. Inner sanctum access: The High Priest was the only individual allowed to enter the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, making him uniquely close to God.

These responsibilities reflect the Jewish belief in a sacred hierarchy and the notion that the High Priest served as a mediator between the people of Israel and God.
