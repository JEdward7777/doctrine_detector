  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the unique responsibilities of the high priest compared to other priests in Israel. They mention key duties, such as performing specific Temple rituals, wearing special garments, officiating on Yom Kippur, and the requirement of Levitical descent. The student also discusses the high priest's exclusive access to the Holy of Holies, highlighting the significant role as a mediator between the people and God.\n\nWhile the student's response goes beyond the reference answer in terms of depth and breadth of information, they accurately capture the essence of the high priest's role in Israelite worship practices. However, the explanation could be improved by focusing on the central aspect of the high priest being the only one permitted to enter the most holy part of the tabernacle or temple to offer a special sacrifice once per year, as stated in the reference answer. This singular duty encapsulates the unique and central role of the high priest in the worship practices of Israel."
