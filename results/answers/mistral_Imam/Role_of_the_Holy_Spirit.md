## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic belief, the concept of being "born again" is not directly analogous to certain Christian traditions. However, the idea of spiritual transformation and the role of divine guidance in a person's life is a significant part of our faith.

For Muslims, the Holy Spirit (Ruh Allah) is mentioned in the Quran and is understood as a form of divine guidance that enables prophets to deliver God's message to humanity. It's not a personal entity that dwells within believers in the same way it is in some Christian traditions.

However, the Holy Spirit can be seen as empowering Muslims in a broader sense. The Quran describes faith as a light from Allah (24:35), and this divine guidance serves to enlighten and guide the believer on their spiritual journey. This empowers them to live according to God's will, make righteous choices, and strive for spiritual growth.

Additionally, in Islamic practice, the Holy Spirit is believed to inspire acts of righteousness, provide wisdom, and protect believers from temptations and evil. In this way, the Holy Spirit can be seen as a source of strength, guidance, and inspiration for Muslims as they navigate their lives and seek to please Allah.
