  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 40 out of 100. While the student made an effort to discuss the concept of divine guidance and empowerment in Islam, the answer strayed off topic by focusing on Islamic beliefs rather than addressing the role of the Holy Spirit in empowering a believer after they are born again in a Christian context. The response also lacked depth and did not directly address the concern of the Holy Spirit's role in a believer's life for spiritual growth and guidance in Christian living. The student should have tied the discussion back to the specific Christian belief regarding the Holy Spirit's empowering presence in a believer's life."
