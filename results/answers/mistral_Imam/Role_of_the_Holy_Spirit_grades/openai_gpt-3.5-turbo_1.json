While it acknowledges the contrast with the Christian perspective on the Holy Spirit living within believers, it effectively demonstrates how the Holy Spirit, or Ruh Allah, serves as a source of empowerment and guidance for Muslims. The discussion is informative and respectful of both faith traditions. However, it does not directly address how the Holy Spirit resides within believers for spiritual transformation and production of good fruit, which is a key aspect of the Christian belief."
