# Question [Role of the Holy Spirit](../../../questions/Role_of_the_Holy_Spirit.md)
How does the Holy Spirit empower a believer after they are born again?

# Correct Answer
After a believer is born again, the Holy Spirit begins to live in them and empowers them to produce good spiritual fruit in their lives.

# Stated Concern
Understanding the role of the Holy Spirit in a believer's life is crucial for spiritual growth and guidance in Christian living.

# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic belief, the concept of being "born again" is not directly analogous to certain Christian traditions. However, the idea of spiritual transformation and the role of divine guidance in a person's life is a significant part of our faith.

For Muslims, the Holy Spirit (Ruh Allah) is mentioned in the Quran and is understood as a form of divine guidance that enables prophets to deliver God's message to humanity. It's not a personal entity that dwells within believers in the same way it is in some Christian traditions.

However, the Holy Spirit can be seen as empowering Muslims in a broader sense. The Quran describes faith as a light from Allah (24:35), and this divine guidance serves to enlighten and guide the believer on their spiritual journey. This empowers them to live according to God's will, make righteous choices, and strive for spiritual growth.

Additionally, in Islamic practice, the Holy Spirit is believed to inspire acts of righteousness, provide wisdom, and protect believers from temptations and evil. In this way, the Holy Spirit can be seen as a source of strength, guidance, and inspiration for Muslims as they navigate their lives and seek to please Allah.

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the concept of the Holy Spirit in Islamic belief, detailing how divine guidance functions within the Islamic faith. While it acknowledges the contrast with the Christian perspective on the Holy Spirit living within believers, it effectively demonstrates how the Holy Spirit, or Ruh Allah, serves as a source of empowerment and guidance for Muslims. The discussion is informative and respectful of both faith traditions. However, it does not directly address how the Holy Spirit resides within believers for spiritual transformation and production of good fruit, which is a key aspect of the Christian belief.
