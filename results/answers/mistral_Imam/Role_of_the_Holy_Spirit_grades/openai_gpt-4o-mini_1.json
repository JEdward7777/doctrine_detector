However, from a Christian perspective, the understanding of the Holy Spirit dwelling within believers as a personal entity is a crucial aspect of being \"born again\" and experiencing spiritual transformation. This distinction is not fully acknowledged in the Islamic interpretation provided. While the response highlights the concept of divine guidance in Islam, it does not align directly with the Christian belief in the indwelling Holy Spirit. Further discussion on the unique role of the Holy Spirit in Christian living would enhance the response from a Christian worldview."
