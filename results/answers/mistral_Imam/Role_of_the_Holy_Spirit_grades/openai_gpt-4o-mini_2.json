However, it does not directly address the Christian belief that the Holy Spirit resides within believers after they are born again, which is a crucial aspect of Christian theology for spiritual growth and guidance. The answer provided from the Islamic perspective is informative but does not fully address the concern with the Christian understanding of the Holy Spirit within believers."
