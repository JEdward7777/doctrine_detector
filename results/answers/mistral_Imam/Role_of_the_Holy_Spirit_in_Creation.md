## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a scholar, I would like to clarify that my responses will be based on Islamic perspectives rather than those found in Christianity or any other religious tradition. In Islam, we believe in the story of creation as it is narrated in the Quran, not in Genesis.

Regarding your question about the Holy Spirit (Ruh Allah) mentioned in Genesis 1:2, this concept does not exist in the same form within Islamic teachings. In Islam, Allah (God) is One and only Self-Sufficient, without need for partners or helpers in His creation.

However, the Quran uses the term "Ruh" (usually translated as spirit or soul) to describe a divine presence, but not as a separate entity involved in the act of creation. In the story of creation, Allah's command, "Be!" and it is, conveys His power and will alone in creating the universe and all that exists within it.

In summary, according to Islamic teachings, there is no Holy Spirit or divine helper involved in the creation of the world as mentioned in Genesis 1:1-2, but rather Allah, who is One and Self-Sufficient, brought everything into existence through His will and power alone.
