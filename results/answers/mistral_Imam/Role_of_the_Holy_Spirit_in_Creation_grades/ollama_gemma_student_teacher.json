  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of Islamic beliefs regarding creation and the nature of Allah. However, it does not engage with the specific concern of the connection between the Holy Spirit and the Trinity as understood in Christian theology. The response lacks an analysis of the significance of the Holy Spirit's involvement from a Christian perspective, which impacts the overall grade."
