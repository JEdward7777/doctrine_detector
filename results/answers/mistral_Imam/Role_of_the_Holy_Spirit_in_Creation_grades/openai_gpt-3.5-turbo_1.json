However, it did not address the concern raised about the role of the Holy Spirit in Christian beliefs. From a Christian worldview, understanding the Trinity and the collaborative work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is crucial in appreciating the unity and divine nature of God. Therefore, the response fell short in acknowledging the significance of the Holy Spirit's role in Christian theology."
