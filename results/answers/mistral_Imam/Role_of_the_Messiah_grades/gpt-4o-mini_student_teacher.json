  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response a 20.\n\nComment: The student's answer, while informative about the Islamic perspective on Jesus, does not address the Christian view of the Messiah as requested in the question. The student focused on Islamic beliefs and did not provide clarity on the roles of the Messiah according to the Bible, which was the main concern specified. This response does not help believers comprehend Jesus's mission and authority from a Christian perspective."
