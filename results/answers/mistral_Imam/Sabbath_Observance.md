## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic tradition, the concept of keeping the Sabbath holy is not directly applicable as our prophetic guidance comes through Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who was sent as a final Messenger to all humanity. However, we do observe a day of rest every week, similar to the Jewish and Christian observance of the Sabbath, which is Friday for Muslims and Saturday for Jews and some Christians.

In Islam, the holy day is known as Jumu'ah (Friday) or the Day of Assembly. Muslims are encouraged to perform congregational prayers on this day, offer additional acts of worship, such as reading the Quran and making duas (supplications), and engaging in good deeds and charity. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "The best day's portion is Friday" [Muslim].

It is worth noting that the Islamic observance of a weekly day of rest is not equivalent to keeping the Sabbath holy as it is understood in Judaism and Christianity. In those traditions, the Sabbath (Saturday for Jews and some Christians, Sunday for most Christians) is seen as a day of complete rest from work and often includes abstaining from certain activities like traveling, cooking, or writing. These practices are not observed by Muslims on their holy day.

In summary, while both Islamic and Jewish/Christian traditions recognize a weekly day of rest, the specific customs and rules surrounding this observance differ significantly between these faiths.
