## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helpful and informative AI model, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences. However, I can share knowledge based on various religious texts. In the case you mentioned, the gathering of manna among the Israelites is detailed in Exodus 16:22-30 in the Bible, which also has a parallel account in the Quran (Surah Al-A'raf, verse 154).

On the sixth day, God instructed the Israelites to gather twice as much manna on that day so that no one would have to collect it on the seventh day, the Sabbath. This was to ensure that there was enough for two days, but none was to be found on the Sabbath, as God had made the heavens and the earth and sanctified the Sabbath, and caused seedtime and harvest to cease in its observance (Exodus 16:26).

In this way, God taught the Israelites respect for the Sabbath day and the importance of rest and spiritual contemplation. This principle is also relevant in Islamic teachings regarding the observance of Friday as a holy day.
