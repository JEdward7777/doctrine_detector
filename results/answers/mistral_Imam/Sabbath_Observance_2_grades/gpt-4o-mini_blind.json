The inclusion of the parallel account in the Quran adds depth to the response. However, it could have been enhanced by emphasizing the aspect of obedience and trust in God's provision that the Israelites demonstrated by following this instruction. Additionally, connecting the significance of the Sabbath to Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of rest and sanctification could have further enriched the explanation from a Christian worldview."
