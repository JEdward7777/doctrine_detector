The student also connected the importance of observing the Sabbath to rest and spiritual contemplation, showcasing an understanding of the significance of Sabbath observance according to God's commands. However, the student's response could have been more focused on directly answering the question rather than including additional information not directly related to the specific instruction given to the Israelites about gathering manna for the Sabbath."
