However, while it clarifies the differences in observance between Islam and Judaism/Christianity, it does not directly address the importance of the Sabbath and its implications for daily living as a Christian. A stronger connection could have been made to highlight the Christian perspective on the significance of the Sabbath in shaping one's relationship with God and guiding one's lifestyle choices."
