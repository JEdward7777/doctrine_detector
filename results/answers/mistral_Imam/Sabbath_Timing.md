## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, as a scholar and imam, I do not have expertise in the specifics of Jewish traditions or practices. However, I can share that according to Judaism, the Sabbath (Shabbat) begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday. This observance is based on the creation story in the Book of Genesis where God rested on the seventh day, which Jews interpret as beginning from Friday evening. The exact timing varies depending on the local time zone and the appearance of sunset. I would recommend consulting a Rabbi or scholar of Judaism for more detailed information regarding this matter.
