However, the focus should have been more on elaborating specifically from Christian perspective rather than Islamic insights. Additionally, the response could have been improved by incorporating more direct references to Christian beliefs regarding the Sabbath. Consideration of the Christian perspective on the importance of Sabbath observance and its parallels with Jewish traditions would have strengthened the answer."
