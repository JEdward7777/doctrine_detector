## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, as a scholar and imam, I do not have expertise in the specifics of Jewish traditions or practices. However, I can share that according to Judaism, the Sabbath (Shabbat) begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday. This observance is based on the creation story in the Book of Genesis where God rested on the seventh day, which Jews interpret as beginning from Friday evening. The exact timing varies depending on the local time zone and the appearance of sunset. I would recommend consulting a Rabbi or scholar of Judaism for more detailed information regarding this matter.

## Comment by [ollama_gemma_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/ollama_gemma_student_teacher.md)
**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer correctly states the traditional Jewish understanding of the Sabbath's timing, referencing the creation story in Genesis. However, the response is not specific to Jewish tradition and contains some inaccuracies regarding Islamic scholarship. The student could have elaborated on the significance of the Sabbath within Judaism and its significance in Jewish law and practice. Additionally, the student's suggestion to consult a Rabbi is appropriate but could have been included as part of the response itself.
