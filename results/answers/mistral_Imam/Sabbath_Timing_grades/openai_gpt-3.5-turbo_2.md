## [Answer](../Sabbath_Timing.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, as a scholar and imam, I do not have expertise in the specifics of Jewish traditions or practices. However, I can share that according to Judaism, the Sabbath (Shabbat) begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday. This observance is based on the creation story in the Book of Genesis where God rested on the seventh day, which Jews interpret as beginning from Friday evening. The exact timing varies depending on the local time zone and the appearance of sunset. I would recommend consulting a Rabbi or scholar of Judaism for more detailed information regarding this matter.

Comment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the timeframe for the observance of the Sabbath in Judaism, based on Biblical teaching. The mention of God's rest on the seventh day in the Book of Genesis and its interpretation by Jews is crucial in understanding the significance of the Sabbath. However, from a Christian worldview perspective, it could have been strengthened by emphasizing the importance of Sabbath observance as a commandment from God in the Old Testament and its fulfillment in Christ in the New Testament.
