  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-structured response with references to Islamic teachings on love and compassion. However, the answer did not directly address the essence of God's love and how it should reflect in personal relationships, as requested in the concern. Additionally, the focus on Jesus in Islamic terms, while informative, did not align closely with the Christian-specific worldview requested for grading. The response lacked a direct comparison with the sacrificial love demonstrated by Jesus in a Christian context."
