## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Jewish context, the Sadducees were a group that emerged during the Second Temple period, known for their strict adherence to the written Torah (the Pentateuch) and rejection of oral traditions. One of the key differences between the beliefs of the Sadducees and other Jewish groups, including the Pharisees and eventually Christianity, was their stance on the resurrection.

The Sadducees did not believe in the concept of bodily resurrection or an afterlife with rewards or punishments. They saw the physical world as the only reality and believed that once a person died, they were completely gone, without any future existence. This belief contrasts significantly with both Pharisaic Jewish teachings (which laid the groundwork for beliefs in the resurrection found within Judaism and eventually Christianity) and Christian teachings about the resurrection of the dead.

In contrast, the Pharisees believed in the doctrine of resurrection of the dead and an afterlife with rewards or punishments. This belief was central to their understanding of Jewish eschatology (the study of the end times). The resurrection is also a key tenet of Christian teaching, as it is foundational to the hope of eternal life for those who believe in Jesus Christ. In Christianity, the resurrection of Jesus Christ is seen as a proof and demonstration of the truth of this belief.

This difference between the Sadducees and other Jewish groups has significant implications for their beliefs about the nature of existence after death, and it contributes to the distinctiveness of Judaism, Christianity, and various Jewish sects during that time.
