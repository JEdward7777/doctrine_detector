## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the New Testament, the process of sanctification for believers in Jesus is described as a gradual transformation that occurs through obedience to God's commandments and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. This process of holiness or sanctification begins at the moment of salvation (justification) and continues throughout one's life.

1 Corinthians 6:11 says, "And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." This verse suggests that sanctification is a work of both justification (being made right with God) and the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit.

In 1 Thessalonians 4:3, Paul writes, "For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor." This verse emphasizes the importance of personal discipline and moral purity in the sanctification process.

In 2 Corinthians 3:18, we read, "And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another." This verse speaks to the transformative power of beholding God's glory and becoming more like Jesus.

In summary, according to the New Testament, sanctification is a lifelong process that occurs through obedience to God's commandments, the guidance of the Holy Spirit, personal discipline, and growing in one's knowledge and experience of God's glory. It results in a gradual transformation into the image of Jesus Christ from one degree of holiness to another.

As a Muslim Imam, I would like to add that the Islamic perspective emphasizes the importance of tawhid (the oneness of God) and practicing the five pillars of Islam as means of purifying oneself and drawing closer to Allah. In both traditions, the ultimate goal is to achieve a state of purity and closeness to God.
