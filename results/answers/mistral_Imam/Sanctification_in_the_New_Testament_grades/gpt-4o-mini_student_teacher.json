  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provides a detailed explanation of the sanctification process for believers in Jesus according to the New Testament, which is commendable. However, the student's inclusion of the Islamic perspective from a Muslim Imam detracts from the Christian specific worldview required for this discussion. In grading this response from a Christian worldview perspective, points are deducted for introducing teachings from another faith tradition that differ significantly from Christian beliefs on sanctification."
