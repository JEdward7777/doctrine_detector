However, it could be strengthened by a more explicit recognition of the role of faith in the process of sanctification.\n\nThe respondent does mention \"obedience to God's commandments\" as part of the sanctification process, but they do not explicitly state that faith is necessary for this process. Additionally, while they do acknowledge the transformative power of beholding God's glory, they could further emphasize how this transformation is made possible through faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nThe inclusion of a quote from 1 Corinthians 6:11 and a brief discussion of its implications are also notable strengths of the response. The addition of an Islamic perspective at the end is interesting but may not be directly relevant to the concern about recognizing the role of faith in sanctification.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of sanctification but could be improved by more explicitly emphasizing the role of faith in this process."
