The Biblical verses cited support the explanation well. However, the inclusion of additional perspectives, in this case, the Islamic perspective, may detract slightly from the Christian-specific focus requested in the concern. Nonetheless, the response effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the role of faith in sanctification."
