The references to relevant Bible verses further enhance the response. However, the response falls short in addressing the concern regarding the role of faith in the process of sanctification. It is essential to emphasize that faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation and catalyst for sanctification to take place in the life of a believer. Therefore, a clearer connection between faith and sanctification would have improved the response."
