The incorporation of relevant Bible verses and explanations demonstrates a thorough knowledge of the topic. However, the response could have further strengthened the Christian perspective by explicitly highlighting the essential role of faith in the process of sanctification, as faith is crucial in one's relationship with God and transformation into the likeness of Christ."
