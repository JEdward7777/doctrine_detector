The focus on obedience to God's commandments, the work of the Holy Spirit, personal discipline, and growing in knowledge of God's glory aligns well with the given concern on recognizing the role of faith in sanctification. The integration of Christian worldview perspectives is thorough and insightful. The only slight deduction is for briefly incorporating an Islamic perspective at the end, which, while interesting, deviates slightly from the primary focus on the Christian understanding of sanctification."
