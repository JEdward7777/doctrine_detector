  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of the term \"sanctuary\" in the biblical context, discussing its significance in relation to the Tabernacle or Temple and its role in worship and forgiveness of sins. The student appropriately connects the term to modern Christian contexts as well. However, the student's answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern raised by the teacher regarding the term \"sanctuary\" as a 'holy place' made sacred by God that provides protection and safety. A deeper exploration of this aspect would have enhanced the answer."
