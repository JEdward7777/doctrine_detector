## [Answer](../Sanctuary_Definition.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, the term "sanctuary" is often used to refer to the Holy Place or the Most Holy Place within the Tabernacle (Mosheh) or the Temple (Beit HaMikdash), which were sacred spaces reserved for the worship of God. The sanctuary served as a symbolic representation of God's presence among his people, and it was here that priests performed various rituals and offerings according to Jewish law.

The First Sanctuary was built under the leadership of Moses in the wilderness, while the Second Temple was constructed by King Solomon in Jerusalem around 1000 BCE. Both sanctuaries were destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout history. The sanctuary's significance lies in its role as a place where God's people could approach him and find forgiveness for their sins through sacrifice, prayer, and obedience to his commandments.

In modern Christian contexts, the term "sanctuary" may also refer to churches or places of worship, which are considered sacred spaces dedicated to God. This usage can be traced back to the biblical understanding of sanctuaries as locations where believers gather for worship and spiritual growth.
