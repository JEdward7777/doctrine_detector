It accurately mentions the specific sections of the sanctuary and their purposes. However, the inclusion of information about Kaaba and Islamic beliefs, while informative, deviates from the focus on God's description of the Old Testament sanctuary. It would have been better to elaborate more on the significance of the sanctuary in relation to God's covenant and the Israelites."
