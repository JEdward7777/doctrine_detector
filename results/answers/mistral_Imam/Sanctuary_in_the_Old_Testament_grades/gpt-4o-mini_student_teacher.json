  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provides a comprehensive overview of how God described the sanctuary in the Old Testament, detailing its structure and significance for the Israelites. However, the inclusion of information about the Islamic sanctuary (Kaaba) is tangential to the question and detracts from the focus on the Christian perspective. The student should have focused solely on the Christian understanding of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people."
