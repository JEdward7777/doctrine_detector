## [Answer](../Sanctuary_in_the_Old_Testament.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Old Testament, God described the sanctuary, also known as the Tabernacle or the Temple, as a sacred place where His presence dwelled among His chosen people, the Israelites. The sanctuary was to be built according to specific instructions given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25-40).

The sanctuary had three main sections: the Holy Place (Hebrew: Hekhal HaKodesh), the Most Holy Place (Hebrew: Debir HaKodashim), and the Courtyard (Hebrew: HaMishkan). The Courtyard was open to everyone, but only the priests could enter the Holy Place. Only the High Priest could enter the Most Holy Place once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).

God described the sanctuary as a symbol of His presence among His people and as a place where they could approach Him for worship, prayer, and atonement. It was a reminder of God's covenant with the Israelites and their obligation to follow His commands. The sanctuary also served as a model for the later construction of the First Temple in Jerusalem and the Second Temple during the Second Temple period.

In the Quran, the Islamic holy book, Muslims believe that the sanctuary (Kaaba) in Mecca was originally built by Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail (Ishmael), and it has been a place of Muslim pilgrimage since the time of the Prophet Muhammad. The Kaaba is considered the holiest site in Islam, and Muslims face it during their daily prayers (Salah).
