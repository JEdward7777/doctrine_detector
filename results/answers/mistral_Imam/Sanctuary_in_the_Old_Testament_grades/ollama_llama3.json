  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a score of 60.\n\nThe response does mention the sanctuary as a place where God lived among His people, which is partially in line with the given answer. However, it also describes the sanctuary as a symbol of God's presence and a place for worship, prayer, and atonement, which goes beyond the original answer. This shows some understanding of the importance of the sanctuary.\n\nThe response also recognizes the significance of the sanctuary as a source of safety for God's people, but this is not explicitly stated in the given concern. Nonetheless, it demonstrates an awareness of the sanctuary's role in providing protection and shelter for those who approached God.\n\nTo improve, the response could have stayed closer to the original answer while still acknowledging the importance of the sanctuary as a dwelling place for God and a source of safety for His people."
