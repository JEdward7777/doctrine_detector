However, it does not delve into the full significance of the sanctuary in terms of worship, atonement, and the symbolic representation of God's covenant with His people. Additionally, while mentioning the Islamic perspective on the Kaaba, it could have connected this to the Christian understanding of the sanctuary more explicitly."
