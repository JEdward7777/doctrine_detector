## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic teachings, it is believed that Satan (Iblis) and his followers will indeed reside in Hell, as a result of their rebellion against God's command and refusal to prostrate before Adam, as ordered by Allah. However, it's important to note that the details of this eternal punishment are not explicitly specified in the Quran or Hadith.

In Surah Al-Kahf (18:50), we read that God said to Iblis: "Out of it [the Fire] you will come forth neither frequently nor briefly, except with a scorching wind and boiling water, and you will have tasted none but a little of the torment that We inflict on the wrongdoers." This verse suggests that Satan's punishment will be severe and everlasting.

Moreover, in Surah Al-Anbiya (21:39-40), Allah describes Hell as a place where "They will wish for death, but it will not be granted them; and they will long to be released from the Fire and be not able to do so." This indicates that Satan and his followers will endure an unending torment.

It is also mentioned in Hadith that Hell has seven gates, and each gate is for a specific sin, such as adultery or lies (Sahih Muslim 2897). While it is not explicitly stated, many scholars interpret this to mean that Satan and his followers may be punished differently depending on their sins.

Ultimately, the fate of Satan and his followers serves as a reminder for Muslims to avoid committing sin and to strive for righteousness in this life, so as to secure Paradise and escape the torment of Hell.
