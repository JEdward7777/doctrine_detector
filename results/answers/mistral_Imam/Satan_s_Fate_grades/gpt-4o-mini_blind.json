However, there are a few areas that could be improved. The answer could have been strengthened by mentioning the concept of punishment being proportional to the sins committed in Islamic belief. Additionally, a more direct reference to the fate of Satan and his followers specifically in Hell could have been beneficial for clarity and specificity. Overall, a solid response but could have been more focused on the specific fate of Satan and his followers in Hell."
