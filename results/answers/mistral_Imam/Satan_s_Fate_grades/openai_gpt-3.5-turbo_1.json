However, the concern was regarding the implications for understanding the struggle between good and evil in Christian theology, and the response did not directly address this aspect. While the explanation about Islamic teachings on Satan's punishment was informative, a connection to Christian theology or a comparison with Christian beliefs concerning Satan's fate would have strengthened the response further."
