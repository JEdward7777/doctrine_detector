It effectively conveys the belief that Satan and his followers will endure eternal punishment in Hell. However, the response does not address how the Islamic understanding of Satan's fate relates to the Christian understanding of the struggle between good and evil. Incorporating a comparison or contrasting perspective from a Christian worldview would have enhanced the response."
