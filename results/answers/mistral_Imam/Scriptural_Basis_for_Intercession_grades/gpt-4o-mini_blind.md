 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices. However, I can share with you some verses from the Bible that Muslims often refer to when discussing intercession (Shafa'ah). It is important to note that interpretations may vary among different sects and scholars. Here are a few verses:

1. Zechariah 3:1 - "Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him." This verse shows an intercession scenario where an angel intervenes on behalf of Joshua.

2. Numbers 14:19 - "And if it is a people of your own land, what have they done that the LORD their God hath not given them all this land? For they have not trespassed against thee, but thou art that hast transgressed against the LORD." Here, Moses intercedes for the Israelites who had disobeyed God, asking for mercy.

3. 1 Timothy 2:1-4 - "I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth." This passage highlights the importance of intercession for others, especially leaders.

4. Romans 8:34 - "Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us." In this verse, Jesus Christ is presented as an intercessor on behalf of humanity.

5. Hebrews 7:25 - "Therefore he is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them." This verse emphasizes the continuous role of Jesus in interceding for believers.

Comment: The response provided Bible verses that Muslims often refer to when discussing intercession, rather than focusing on the Christian perspective on intercessory prayer. The answer missed the mark by not addressing the question from a Christian-specific worldview. To improve, the student should focus on citing verses and explanations that align with biblical teachings on interceding for others as understood within Christianity.
