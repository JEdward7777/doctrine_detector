 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices. However, I can share with you some verses from the Bible that Muslims often refer to when discussing intercession (Shafa'ah). It is important to note that interpretations may vary among different sects and scholars. Here are a few verses:

1. Zechariah 3:1 - "Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him." This verse shows an intercession scenario where an angel intervenes on behalf of Joshua.

2. Numbers 14:19 - "And if it is a people of your own land, what have they done that the LORD their God hath not given them all this land? For they have not trespassed against thee, but thou art that hast transgressed against the LORD." Here, Moses intercedes for the Israelites who had disobeyed God, asking for mercy.

3. 1 Timothy 2:1-4 - "I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth." This passage highlights the importance of intercession for others, especially leaders.

4. Romans 8:34 - "Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us." In this verse, Jesus Christ is presented as an intercessor on behalf of humanity.

5. Hebrews 7:25 - "Therefore he is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them." This verse emphasizes the continuous role of Jesus in interceding for believers.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response provides some relevant biblical passages related to intercession, which aligns with the concern to encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. The provided verses from Zechariah, Numbers, 1 Timothy, Romans, and Hebrews are all relevant to the topic of intercession. The fact that the assistant highlights different scenarios of intercession, such as angels intervening on behalf of humans, Moses asking for mercy, and Jesus Christ's continuous intercession, also shows a good understanding of the concept.

However, I would deduct 20 points because the response does not explicitly state how these verses can guide believers in their prayer and intercession. While the provided passages are relevant, they could be more effectively applied to encourage believers to explore Scripture for guidance on prayer and intercession. Additionally, there is no explicit connection made between these biblical examples and the concern of encouraging believers to explore Scripture.

Overall, while the response provides some good biblical examples related to intercession, it could be improved by providing a clearer application of these verses to guide believers in their prayer and intercession practices.
