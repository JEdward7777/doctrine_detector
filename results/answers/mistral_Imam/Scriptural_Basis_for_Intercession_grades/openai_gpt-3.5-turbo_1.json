  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides an excellent selection of verses from the Bible that discuss intercession, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. The inclusion of verses like Hebrews 7:25, Romans 8:33-34, and others complements the original answer well and encourages believers to seek guidance from Scripture on prayer and intercession. The response could be further enriched by offering some personal reflection or application of these verses to Christian prayer practices."
