  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant biblical references related to atonement and forgiveness, which is a good effort. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the concept of propitiation as understood in Christian theology. The student correctly identified the verses but did not explicitly explain how they support the concept of propitiation. The response also focuses more on contrasting Islamic beliefs rather than delving deeper into the Christian understanding of propitiation. Overall, while the student showed knowledge of some relevant passages, a stronger emphasis on the specific concept of propitiation and its significance in Christian theology would have improved the response."
