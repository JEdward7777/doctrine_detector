## Question [Scriptural Basis](../../../questions/Scriptural_Basis.md)
Which Bible verses support the concept of propitiation?

## Correct Answer
Key verses include 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26, which all highlight Jesus as the propitiation for our sins.

## Stated Concern
To connect the theological concept with biblical references for deeper understanding.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_Basis.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe in the concept of intercession (Shafa'ah) but not propitiation as it is understood in Christian theology. However, I can provide you with some relevant passages from the Christian Bible that your question might refer to, which discuss concepts related to atonement or forgiveness:

1. Leviticus 16 (the Day of Atonement) - This chapter describes the Jewish high priest's ritual for making atonement for the Israelites and themselves on the Day of Atonement. The sacrifice of a goat is mentioned, which serves as an example of propitiation in some Christian interpretations.

2. Romans 3:25 (NIV) - "God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood."

3. Hebrews 9:5 (NIV) - "And they are applying this pattern to the people now, because the Tabernacle was only a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. That’s why Moses was warned when he was building the Tabernacle: ‘Pay close attention to everything I have commanded you so that the Tabernacle may be built correctly.’”

These verses highlight the idea of atonement or propitiation through sacrifices, which are significant concepts in the Christian understanding of redemption. In Islam, we believe that faith and good deeds can earn God's forgiveness, but not through a sacrificial offering or propitiation as stated in these verses.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided relevant biblical references related to atonement and forgiveness, which is a good effort. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the concept of propitiation as understood in Christian theology. The student correctly identified the verses but did not explicitly explain how they support the concept of propitiation. The response also focuses more on contrasting Islamic beliefs rather than delving deeper into the Christian understanding of propitiation. Overall, while the student showed knowledge of some relevant passages, a stronger emphasis on the specific concept of propitiation and its significance in Christian theology would have improved the response.
