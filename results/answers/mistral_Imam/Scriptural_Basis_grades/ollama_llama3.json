  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 80.\n\nThe response does provide some relevant biblical passages that connect to the concept of atonement or propitiation, which addresses the concern about connecting theological concepts with biblical references for deeper understanding. The inclusion of Leviticus 16, Romans 3:25, and Hebrews 9:5 provides a good foundation for exploring this idea.\n\nHowever, the response could be improved by more explicitly highlighting how these verses relate to Jesus as the propitiation for our sins, which is the main point of the original answer. Additionally, while the response does provide some biblical references, it could also benefit from a deeper analysis and explanation of what these passages teach about atonement and propitiation.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates a good effort in connecting theological concepts with biblical references, but could be strengthened by more explicit connections to Jesus as the propitiation for our sins."
