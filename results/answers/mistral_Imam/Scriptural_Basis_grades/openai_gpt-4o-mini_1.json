  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response effectively connects the theological concept of propitiation with relevant biblical references for deeper understanding in Christian theology. The inclusion of key verses such as 1 John 2:2, 1 John 4:10, and Romans 3:25-26 supports the explanation of Jesus as the propitiation for our sins within the Christian worldview. The response could have benefited from further elaboration on how these verses specifically relate to the concept of propitiation, but overall it demonstrates a good understanding of the topic."
