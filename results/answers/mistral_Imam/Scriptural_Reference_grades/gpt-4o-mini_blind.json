  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComments: The student provided a detailed and informative response, referencing various biblical passages that touch on the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers. However, the answer strays significantly from the Christian worldview by primarily incorporating Islamic references and interpretations while discussing the Bible. A significant portion of the response focuses on Islamic perspectives rather than Christian perspectives, which is not suitable for a question specifically asking about biblical passages. Additionally, the student should have focused solely on providing insights from the Bible rather than incorporating content from other religious texts. This approach lacked doctrinal correctness within a Christian worldview."
