## [Answer](../Scriptural_Reference.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or religious affiliations, but I can share some insights based on the Quran and Hadiths, which are foundational texts in Islam. However, for your question regarding biblical passages, I will provide answers from a Muslim perspective using references from the Bible.

In the Bible, several verses discuss the concept of the 'world' as it pertains to believers. For instance:

1. John 3:16 - "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." Here, the word "world" (κόσμος in Greek) can be understood as humanity or all of mankind.

2. John 17:14-18 - In Jesus' prayer to God, he prays for his disciples and those who would believe through their message, that they may be sanctified (made holy) in truth. Here, the word "world" (οἱ ἄλλοι τε κόσμοι in Greek) can be interpreted as non-believers or other peoples.

3. 1 John 2:15-17 - The Apostle John warns believers not to love the world (κόσμον in Greek), but rather, to love God and keep his commandments because the world passes away, and its desires lead people into sin, but those who do what pleases God remain forever. In this context, "world" can refer to a system or way of life that is opposed to God's will.

4. Romans 12:2 - "Do not be conformed to this world (σὲκοῦ in Greek), but be transformed by the renewing of your mind." Here, the Apostle Paul encourages believers not to conform to the patterns of the world, but to be transformed by God's will.

These verses reflect the Bible's perspective on the relationship between believers and the 'world.' In each case, the concept of the 'world' carries various nuances, such as humanity, non-believers, a system or way of life that is opposed to God, or the temporary nature of this world.

Grade: 30

Comment: While the student provided relevant biblical passages discussing the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers, their choice to base their response on the Quran and Hadiths, and then trying to connect it to the Bible from a Muslim perspective, deviates significantly from the Christian worldview being requested. It is important for answers to align with the specific worldview in question for accurate and relevant information to be conveyed. Additionally, not directly addressing the concern of navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values impacts the effectiveness of the response.
