  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:**\n\nThe student's answer is well-researched and thoughtfully analyzes several biblical passages related to the concept of the 'world' in relation to believers. They provide insightful interpretations of the different nuances of the word \"world\" in these passages and demonstrate a clear understanding of the biblical perspective on the relationship between believers and the broader world. However, the answer would benefit from explicitly referencing the provided concern about navigating life as a believer in a world characterized by ungodly values."
