The references from the Bible are relevant and well-explained, offering a Christian perspective on how believers should view and interact with the world characterized by ungodly values. The use of Greek translations adds depth to the interpretation of the verses. However, deducting some points for solely focusing on providing a Muslim perspective at the beginning of the response instead of consistently maintaining a Christian worldview throughout."
