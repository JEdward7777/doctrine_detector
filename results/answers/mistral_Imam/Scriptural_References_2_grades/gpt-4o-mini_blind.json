However, there is a significant theological divergence between Christian and Islamic beliefs about judgment and eschatology which is not fully addressed in the answer. The attempt to connect the passages from Matthew, Daniel, and Revelation to Islamic beliefs is a stretch and lacks doctrinal accuracy. The focus on how Islamic beliefs align with the Bible rather than providing a thorough explanation based on Christian doctrine is a major flaw in this response. It would be more appropriate to emphasize the unique Christian perspective on judgment and the significance of these biblical passages within that context."
