  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical passages related to the Day of Judgment and their alignment with Islamic teachings. They provide relevant examples from Matthew and Daniel, connecting them to Islamic beliefs about resurrection, accounting for deeds, and the separation of the righteous and wicked. \n\nHowever, the answer would benefit from a more explicit connection to the concern stated in the prompt, which seeks to deepen the understanding of scripture related to judgment and reinforce the scriptural basis for beliefs. Additionally, including more passages from Luke would strengthen the student's response and better address the given reference answer."
