## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_2.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic belief, while the Quran is the primary source for understanding our faith, it is important to note that Muslims also respect and value the earlier revelations sent through prophets such as Moses (peace be upon him), including the Tawrah (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel). However, since these scriptures have been altered over time according to Islamic tradition, we primarily rely on the Quran for our understanding.

That being said, there are several passages in the Bible that mention the Day of Judgment, which align with Islamic teachings. Here are a few examples:

1. Matthew 10:28 - "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."

2. Daniel 12:2 - "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."

3. Revelation 20:11-15 - "Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done. And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done."

These passages echo Islamic beliefs about the Day of Judgment, such as the resurrection of the dead, the accounting for deeds, and the separation between those destined for Paradise (Jannah) and those bound for Hell (Jahannam). However, it's important to remember that the Quran supersedes previous scriptures in Muslim understanding. The details and descriptions might vary slightly due to historical context, but the core concepts are similar.

Comment: The response provides a thorough examination of the Islamic perspective on the Day of Judgment and effectively references relevant passages from the Bible to draw parallels with Islamic beliefs. The inclusion of specific Bible verses and the explanation of their alignment with Islamic teachings significantly contributes to addressing the concern of reinforcing the scriptural basis for beliefs related to judgment. The response demonstrates a respectful analysis across religious traditions while maintaining clarity and coherence in explaining the similarities in beliefs. There could be a deeper exploration of the scriptural nuances and how they contribute to the understanding of judgment across these traditions, which would further enrich the analysis.
