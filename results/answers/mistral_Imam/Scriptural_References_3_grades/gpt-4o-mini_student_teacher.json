  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the passage from both Christianity and Islam, highlighting the common theme of sincerity and integrity. However, the response did not directly address the concern about the importance of pursuing genuine holiness over mere external compliance in Christianity. The student's answer is informative and insightful but lacks focus on the specific Christian worldview aspect emphasized in the concern."
