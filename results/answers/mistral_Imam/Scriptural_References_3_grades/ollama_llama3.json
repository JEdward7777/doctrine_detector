  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear summary of Matthew 23:27-28, highlighting the theme of iniquity manifesting outwardly versus inner righteousness. It also nicely connects this passage to a similar teaching in Islam, showcasing an ecumenical approach that values commonalities across faiths.\n\nHowever, the grade is not perfect because while the response does touch on the concern about pursuing genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance, it could delve deeper into this theme and provide more explicit connections to Christian living. For instance, the response could discuss how Christians can cultivate inner righteousness through practices like prayer, worship, and service.\n\nOverall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the passage and its relevance to the concern, but could benefit from further development in exploring the implications for Christian life."
