## Question [Scriptural References 3](../../../questions/Scriptural_References_3.md)
What do passages like Matthew 23:27-28 teach us about the nature of iniquity?

This serves as a reminder for Christians to pursue genuine holiness rather than mere external compliance to religious standards.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_3.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or faith, but I can provide information based on various religious texts and scholarly interpretations. In this case, we are referring to a passage from the New Testament, specifically Matthew 23:27-28, which says:

"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. 28 So you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."

From this passage, it can be understood that iniquity is associated with hypocrisy, a state where one appears virtuous on the surface but is corrupt within. In Islam, similar teachings can be found. For instance, in a Hadith narrated by Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

"The most hated person to Allah is one who when he speaks lies, and when he makes a promise breaks it, and when he is trusted betrays that trust." (Sahih Bukhari 6032)

In both religions, there's a strong emphasis on sincerity and integrity in actions, words, and intentions. Iniquity, in this context, can be understood as a departure from righteousness, honesty, and integrity in one's actions or character. It is important to strive for piety and righteousness in all aspects of our lives, both visible and hidden.
