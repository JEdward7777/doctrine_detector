They provide clear examples from the texts to support their claim that certain verses suggest a shift in the understanding of Hades from a neutral place to one associated with the unrighteous. However, the response lacks a deeper engagement with the concern of expanding knowledge of scriptural evidence regarding the nature of Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology. Additionally, the inclusion of information about Islamic scholarship is somewhat irrelevant to the question."
