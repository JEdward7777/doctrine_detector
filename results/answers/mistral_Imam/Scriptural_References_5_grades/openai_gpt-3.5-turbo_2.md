## [Answer](../Scriptural_References_5.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic scholarship, it's important to note that Muslims primarily rely on the Quran as their primary religious text, rather than the New Testament. However, I can provide some insight into how certain verses in the New Testament are understood by some Christian scholars who interpret them as a shift in the concept of Hades from a neutral place for all the dead to a location associated with the unrighteous.

1. Luke 16:23 (New International Version): "The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried." In this verse, Hades is mentioned as a place where two individuals go after their deathâ€”the beggar goes to Abraham's bosom, which is often understood by some Christians as Paradise, while the rich man goes to Hades itself, which is associated with torment.

2. Matthew 11:23 (New International Version): "And you, Capernaum, who are so exalted! You will be brought down to Hades." In this verse, Jesus seems to use Hades as a synonym for Hell or the place of punishment, suggesting it is not a neutral resting place for all.

3. Revelation 1:18 (New International Version): "I am He who lives, and I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Death and Hades." Here, Jesus is depicted as having control over both Death and Hades, which could be interpreted as associating Hades with a place of death or punishment.

These verses are subject to interpretation, and it's essential to remember that Islamic beliefs about the afterlife primarily come from the Quranic account.
