  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough analysis of specific verses from the New Testament that discuss Hades and its implications for Christian eschatology. It effectively connects the verses to illustrate a potential shift in understanding regarding Hades as a place for the unrighteous and 'paradise' for the righteous. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the scriptural evidence and its implications within a Christian eschatological framework."
