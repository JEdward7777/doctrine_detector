It would have been more appropriate to provide an answer solely from a Christian perspective, as requested in the question. Additionally, the integration of Islamic teachings detracts from the doctrinal correctness expected in a Christian-specific worldview. The quotes from the Bible given are relevant, but the inclusion of references to the Quran and Hadiths is not aligned with the Christian faith."
