The connections drawn between humility, submission, and exaltation in both passages are insightful and demonstrate a strong understanding of how these principles are central to the Christian faith. The response also shows respect for the Christian beliefs and practices while drawing parallels with Islamic perspectives on humility, submission, and exaltation in relation to God."
