  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student provided a well-researched and detailed explanation of Islamic teachings on living a blameless life, the response did not address the specific concern of providing scriptural references and guidance for Christians. The answer needed to focus more on Christian beliefs rather than Islamic teachings. Additionally, the student did not include the key references highlighted by the teacher. Therefore, the grade is lower due to the lack of alignment with the specified concern and reference answer."
