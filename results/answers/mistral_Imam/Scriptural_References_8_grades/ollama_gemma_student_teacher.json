  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the concept of being blameless from both Islamic and Christian perspectives. They provide relevant scriptural references from both traditions to support their claims and clearly explain how these references guide individuals towards living a blameless life. The inclusion of parallels between Islamic and Christian teachings adds depth to the analysis. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on how the referenced verses specifically address the concern of maintaining a blameless character. Additionally, including more direct connections to the provided reference answer would strengthen the overall coherence of the response."
