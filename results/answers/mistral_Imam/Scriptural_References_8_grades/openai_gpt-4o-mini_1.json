  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic teachings on living a blameless life and effectively draws parallels between Islamic and Christian perspectives. However, the student could have incorporated the additional references provided in the answer and explained how they align with the Christian worldview in more detail. Overall, the response shows strong knowledge of religious texts and concepts but could have strengthened the connection between the specific Christian verses and the broader theme of living a blameless life."
