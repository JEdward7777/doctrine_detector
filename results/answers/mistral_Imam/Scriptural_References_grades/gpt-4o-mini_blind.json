  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response is generally accurate and provides relevant information about God being referred to as 'Almighty' in Genesis in relation to Abraham. The student also includes a comparison with Islamic tradition, which enhances the understanding of the topic. However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the Christian perspective without delving too much into the Islamic references. Overall, a solid response."
