## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian Bible, the book that contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' (Arabic: Al-Aleem) in relation to Abraham is Genesis. Specifically, the verse that mentions this is Genesis 17:1, which says, "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, 'I am God Almighty. Walk before me faithfully.'"

In Islamic tradition, Abraham (Arabic: Ibrahim) is considered a major prophet who submitted to Allah (God). However, since Islam recognizes only the Arabic language as the original language of the divine revelations, it does not refer to God as "Almighty" in this way. Instead, Allah is called Ar-Raqib (The Watcher), Al-Wakeel (The Trustee), and Al-Aleem (The All-Knowing). The Quran contains references to Abraham's story and his unwavering faith in God.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student's response provides a thorough explanation linking the reference to God as 'Almighty' to Genesis 17:1. However, the additional information about Islamic tradition, while informative, deviates slightly from the question's focus on the Christian Bible. It would have been more concise to stick closely to the original question for a higher grade.
