## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian Bible, the book that contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' (Arabic: Al-Aleem) in relation to Abraham is Genesis. Specifically, the verse that mentions this is Genesis 17:1, which says, "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, 'I am God Almighty. Walk before me faithfully.'"

In Islamic tradition, Abraham (Arabic: Ibrahim) is considered a major prophet who submitted to Allah (God). However, since Islam recognizes only the Arabic language as the original language of the divine revelations, it does not refer to God as "Almighty" in this way. Instead, Allah is called Ar-Raqib (The Watcher), Al-Wakeel (The Trustee), and Al-Aleem (The All-Knowing). The Quran contains references to Abraham's story and his unwavering faith in God.

Grade: 90

Comment: The response correctly identifies the book of Genesis as containing the reference to God as "Almighty" and specifically cites Genesis 17:1, which is accurate. The response also provides some additional context about Abraham's significance in both Christian and Islamic traditions, although this is not directly related to the concern about knowing biblical references. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the biblical reference and shows an effort to provide relevant information. However, it could be improved by further emphasizing the importance of knowing biblical references for deepening one's connection to Scripture and God's promises.

The response falls short of a perfect score because it does not explicitly address how knowing this specific biblical reference (Genesis 17:1) can help deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.
