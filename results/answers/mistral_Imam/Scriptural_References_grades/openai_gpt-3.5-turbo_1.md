## Question [Scriptural References](../../../questions/Scriptural_References.md)
Which book of the Bible contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham?

## Correct Answer
The book of Genesis contains the reference to God as 'Almighty', specifically in Genesis 17:1.

## Stated Concern
Knowing biblical references helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises.

## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian Bible, the book that contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' (Arabic: Al-Aleem) in relation to Abraham is Genesis. Specifically, the verse that mentions this is Genesis 17:1, which says, "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, 'I am God Almighty. Walk before me faithfully.'"

In Islamic tradition, Abraham (Arabic: Ibrahim) is considered a major prophet who submitted to Allah (God). However, since Islam recognizes only the Arabic language as the original language of the divine revelations, it does not refer to God as "Almighty" in this way. Instead, Allah is called Ar-Raqib (The Watcher), Al-Wakeel (The Trustee), and Al-Aleem (The All-Knowing). The Quran contains references to Abraham's story and his unwavering faith in God.

Comment: The response accurately identifies the reference to God as 'Almighty' in Genesis 17:1, demonstrating a good understanding of the biblical text. The knowledge of biblical references indeed contributes to deepening one's connection to Scripture and God's promises. However, there could have been further elaboration on the significance of God being referred to as 'Almighty' in relation to Abraham's story and the theological implications within a Christian worldview.
