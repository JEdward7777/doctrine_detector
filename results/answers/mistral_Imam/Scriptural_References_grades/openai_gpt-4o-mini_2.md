## [Answer](../Scriptural_References.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian Bible, the book that contains the reference to God as 'Almighty' (Arabic: Al-Aleem) in relation to Abraham is Genesis. Specifically, the verse that mentions this is Genesis 17:1, which says, "When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, 'I am God Almighty. Walk before me faithfully.'"

In Islamic tradition, Abraham (Arabic: Ibrahim) is considered a major prophet who submitted to Allah (God). However, since Islam recognizes only the Arabic language as the original language of the divine revelations, it does not refer to God as "Almighty" in this way. Instead, Allah is called Ar-Raqib (The Watcher), Al-Wakeel (The Trustee), and Al-Aleem (The All-Knowing). The Quran contains references to Abraham's story and his unwavering faith in God.

Comment: The response accurately identifies the biblical reference to God as 'Almighty' in Genesis 17:1, aligning well with the given answer. Understanding biblical references indeed helps deepen our connection to Scripture and God's promises. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of recognizing God's attributes in different religious traditions, such as how Christians and Muslims perceive and refer to God in their respective traditions.
