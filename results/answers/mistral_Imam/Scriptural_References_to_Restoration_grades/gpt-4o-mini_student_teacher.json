  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant Bible verses emphasizing the theme of restoration, but the response also incorporated information about Islamic teachings, which may not align with a Christian-specific worldview. It would have been more appropriate to focus solely on Christian scriptures and teachings related to restoration. Additionally, the student could have included a more concise and focused explanation of the verses provided in relation to the concept of restoration in one's faith journey."
