However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to emphasize the centrality of Jesus Christ in restoring a seared conscience, rather than just focusing on seeking guidance and repentance from Allah. Additionally, the answer could have been more specific in addressing the implications for a believer in Christianity. More references to biblical passages and doctrines related to conscience and repentance could have strengthened the response. Overall, there is room for improvement in connecting the concept to Christian beliefs."
