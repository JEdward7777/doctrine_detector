  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComments: While the student shows respect for Christianity and attempts to draw parallels between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding Jesus' return, there are significant doctrinal inaccuracies in their response. The interpretation of Jesus as the Son of Man in Islamic tradition, the description of events surrounding Jesus' return, and the belief in the abolition of Christianity are not in line with Christian teachings. It is important for the student to accurately represent Christian beliefs when discussing theological topics to avoid misleading interpretations."
