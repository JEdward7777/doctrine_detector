## [Answer](../Second_Coming.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in respecting and understanding all religious beliefs, including Christianity. In this context, we are discussing Jesus' statement about the "Son of Man" coming with great power and glory (Mark 14:62). This statement is part of the Hadith Qudsi in Islamic tradition, where it is said that Allah states, "I was a hidden treasure and I loved to be known." Therefore, when Jesus speaks of the Son of Man, he is referring to himself as a human embodiment of God's will.

In terms of interpretation for believers, this can be understood as a prophecy of Jesus' return in a divine capacity, which is a fundamental belief shared between many Christians and Muslims regarding the Second Coming of Isa (Jesus). In Islamic tradition, however, it is believed that before his return, Isa will first descend to Earth to break the cross, kill the pig, and abolish jizya (a tax levied on non-Muslims living under Muslim rule) – events that signify the end of Christianity and its false idols. Afterwards, he will join hands with the Mahdi (the Islamic savior figure) to establish global peace and justice.

While our beliefs may differ in certain aspects, both religions share an expectation of Jesus' return as a significant event in the End Times. It is essential for followers of these faiths to remain steadfast and hopeful while preparing themselves spiritually and morally for the arrival of their prophet and awaiting the fulfillment of God's promise.
