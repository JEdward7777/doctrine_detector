However, there is a significant divergence from Christian theology towards the end of the response, as the beliefs presented align more closely with Islamic eschatology than Christian beliefs. While it acknowledges the shared expectation of Jesus' return, it does not fully elaborate on how this impacts Christian hope and eschatology specifically. Additional focus on the unique Christian understanding of Jesus' second coming and its significance for Christian belief would have strengthened the response."
