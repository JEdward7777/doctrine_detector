While it acknowledges the shared expectation of Jesus' return and the importance of spiritual preparation, the emphasis on conflicting details such as the actions Isa is said to take upon his return in Islamic tradition detracts from a clear Christian understanding of Jesus' role as the Messiah. It falls short in fully addressing the Christian hope and eschatological implications of Jesus' second coming."
