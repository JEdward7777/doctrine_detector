The connection to the Pharisees' desire to uphold their faith is well-explained from a Christian worldview, recognizing the importance of preserving religious identity while living among different cultural influences. However, the mention of Islam and its relationship to the Pharisees, while informative, slightly detracts from the focused Christian perspective on the Pharisees' concerns."
