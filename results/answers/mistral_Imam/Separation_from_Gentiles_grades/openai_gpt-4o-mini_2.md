## [Answer](../Separation_from_Gentiles.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the historical and religious context of Judaism, the Pharisees, who lived during the Second Temple period (approximately 200 BCE - 70 CE), were a group that emphasized adherence to traditional Jewish law and practices. They believed in strict observance of the Torah and its interpretation by oral traditions.

The separation between Jews and Gentiles, or non-Jews, was a matter of religious identity and purity laws outlined in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). The Pharisees saw it as essential to preserve their unique cultural and spiritual heritage while maintaining the distinctness of Jewish identity amidst the broader Greco-Roman world.

The separation was also a means to protect the Jewish people from adopting non-Jewish customs or beliefs, which could potentially compromise their relationship with God. This was not out of hatred for Gentiles but rather a desire to uphold their religious and cultural traditions.

In the context of this question, it is essential to clarify that Islam later came on the scene, and the Pharisees are mentioned in the Quran as being among the people of the Scripture (Ahl al-Kitab). Muslims believe that the teachings of Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad all convey the same message of monotheism and moral values.
