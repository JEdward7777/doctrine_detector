## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic perspective, the story of Noah (Prophet Nuh) and the Rainbow is found in the Quran, not Genesis, but the message remains similar. According to the Quran, Allah (God) made a covenant with all living creatures that He will never destroy the earth again by a flood as long as the signs of His covenant are visible in the sky: "And We have left for you of every kind of sign, then take from the signs of Allah's mercy." (Quran 50:68)

The rainbow is one such sign. It appears after a rainstorm when sunlight refracts through water droplets in the atmosphere. In Islamic tradition, it represents God's promise to humanity and all creation that He will never again punish the world with a flood. This beautiful natural phenomenon serves as a reminder of Allah's mercy, compassion, and commitment to His creations.

In addition, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is reported to have said: "The Rainbow is one of the seven signs of Allah's Mercy. Whenever you see it, invoke God's blessing for it is among the seven that Allah has placed in the sky as a sign for His earth and He is pleased with those who are pleased with them." (Muslim)

So, from an Islamic perspective, the rainbow serves as a sign of Allah's covenant with humanity, symbolizing mercy, compassion, and divine promise.
