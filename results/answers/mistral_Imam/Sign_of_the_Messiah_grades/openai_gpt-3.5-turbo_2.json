However, it could have delved deeper into the theme of recognizing the fulfillment of prophecies and God's plan through signs, especially from a Christian-specific worldview. A more in-depth analysis of the theological implications of the sign given to the shepherds in relation to prophecy fulfillment would have strengthened the response."
