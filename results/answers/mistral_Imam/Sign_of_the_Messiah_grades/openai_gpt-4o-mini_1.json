However, the response could have delved deeper into the Christian perspective on the specific significance of the sign given to the shepherds as an indication of the arrival of the Messiah, connecting it more explicitly to the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and God's divine plan through Jesus Christ. The analysis lacked a thorough exploration of the theological significance of the sign in the context of Christian beliefs."
