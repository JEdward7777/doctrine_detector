  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The student accurately discusses the significance of the altar in ancient Israelite worship and its role in religious rituals and offerings. However, the student's inclusion of information about Islam, while perhaps meant to draw parallels, detracts from the Christian-specific worldview required for the prompt. In a Christian context, the discussion should have focused solely on the significance of the altar in Israelite worship practices without adding comparisons to other religions. To improve, the student should have elaborated more on the theological significance of the altar within the Old Testament framework."
