  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a good understanding of the significance of altars in ancient Israelite worship, mentioning the performance of religious rituals, symbolic connection with God, and various offerings. However, there was a lack of focus on the importance of sacrifice and devotion in the context of biblical worship, which was a specified concern in the question. The student's comparison with Islam, while interesting, diverted from the Christian-specific worldview needed for this question."
