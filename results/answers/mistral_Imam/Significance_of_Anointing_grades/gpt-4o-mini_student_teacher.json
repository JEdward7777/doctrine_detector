  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the significance of anointing in the context of Old Testament priests, kings, and prophets. They accurately highlight the symbolic nature of anointing with oil as a symbol of consecration and divine approval. The student effectively references specific biblical passages to support their points. However, the student's answer could be improved by emphasizing more on the aspect of being empowered by God for their roles, as noted in the reference answer. This addition would strengthen their discussion from a Christian worldview perspective."
