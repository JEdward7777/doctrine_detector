However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the theological implications of 'Shaddai' being a title rather than a name in the biblical context, specifically from a Christian worldview. Mentioning the unique characteristics of God as revealed in the Bible and how 'Shaddai' reflects those attributes would enhance the response."
