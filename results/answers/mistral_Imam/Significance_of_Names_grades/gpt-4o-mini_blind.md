## Question [Significance of Names](../../../questions/Significance_of_Names.md)
Why is it significant that 'Shaddai' is often translated as a title rather than a name in Bible translations?

## Correct Answer
Translating 'Shaddai' as a title emphasizes God's attributes, specifically His omnipotence and strength, while using it as a name highlights a personal relationship with God.

## Stated Concern
Deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Significance_of_Names.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic theology, the term "Allah" is considered the unique and proper name of God, with no plural or gender form. However, when we discuss the Bible from a comparative perspective, it's important to understand that 'Shaddai' (or Shaddai Elohim in Hebrew) holds significant meaning.

The title 'Shaddai' is often translated as "Almighty" in many English Biblical translations, and it appears over 40 times in the Old Testament. This title emphasizes God's sovereignty, power, and provision, which aligns with the Islamic belief that Allah is the Most Powerful and Self-Sufficient.

The significance of 'Shaddai' being a title rather than a name lies in its connotation of qualities associated with God, reminding us of His attributes rather than focusing on what we might perceive as His personality or physical appearance, which is not depicted in either the Bible or the Quran. This is consistent with the monotheistic belief that there is only one God, beyond human comprehension and description.

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provides a good comparison between the Islamic perspective on the name of God and the significance of 'Shaddai' in the Bible, highlighting its emphasis on God's attributes of sovereignty, power, and provision. However, the answer could be improved by delving deeper into the theological implications of 'Shaddai' being a title rather than a name in the biblical context, specifically from a Christian worldview. Mentioning the unique characteristics of God as revealed in the Bible and how 'Shaddai' reflects those attributes would enhance the response.
