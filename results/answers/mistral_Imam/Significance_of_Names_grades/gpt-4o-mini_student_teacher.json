  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as a 80.\n\nThe student successfully discusses the significance of 'Shaddai' as a title in emphasizing God's attributes related to power and provision. They also touch upon the monotheistic belief and comparison with Islamic theology. However, the answer could have delved deeper into how understanding 'Shaddai' as a title versus a name impacts the Christian understanding of God's character and relational aspect. Additionally, the answer could have incorporated more specifically Christian theological insights to strengthen the response."
