However, it does not directly address the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith, which is an important aspect to consider from a Christian worldview. Further elaboration on how understanding 'Shaddai' as a title or name can contribute to a deeper relationship with God would enhance the response."
