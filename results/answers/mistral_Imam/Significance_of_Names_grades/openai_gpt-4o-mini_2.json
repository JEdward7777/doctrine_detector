It effectively addresses the concern of deepening the understanding of God's character and relational aspect in the Christian faith. The integration of a Christian worldview could be enhanced by explicitly connecting the attributes of 'Shaddai' to the Christian understanding of God's omnipotence and relational nature through Jesus Christ."
