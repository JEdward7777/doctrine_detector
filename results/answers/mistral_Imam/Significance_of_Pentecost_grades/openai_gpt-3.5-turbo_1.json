It effectively addresses the concern about understanding the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of believers from a Christian perspective. The only thing missing is a direct reference to the specific biblical passage (Acts 2:1-4) that describes the event of the Holy Spirit descending on the believers, which would have strengthened the response even further."
