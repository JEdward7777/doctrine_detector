  "grade": 40.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed explanation of the significance of unleavened bread in Islamic tradition, drawing parallels to simplicity and spiritual purity. However, the response did not directly address the concern of understanding the spiritual significance of unleavened bread in Christian teachings. The answer lacked a clear connection to sin and living a life that honors God as represented by unleavened bread in Christianity. Hence, the grade is lower due to the lack of alignment with the specified concern."
