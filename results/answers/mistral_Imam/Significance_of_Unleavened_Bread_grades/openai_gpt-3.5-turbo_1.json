While the focus is on Islamic teachings, the metaphorical connection made with the Christian concept of removing sin to honor God shows an understanding of the concern, albeit from a different religious perspective. The response demonstrates a deep theological reflection and effectively relates relevant scriptures and teachings to the topic at hand."
