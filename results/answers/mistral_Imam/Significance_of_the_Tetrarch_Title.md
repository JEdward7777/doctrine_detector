## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the time of Jesus, Palestine was under Roman rule, and the region was divided into administrative districts known as provinces. One such province was Judea, which was further subdivided into smaller regions governed by a title called "tetrarch." The term "tetrarch" comes from the Greek word 'tetartchos', meaning 'ruler of a fourth part'.

A tetrarch was responsible for governing one of these smaller territories within a larger province. Herod Antipas, for instance, served as the tetrarch over Galilee and Perea (parts of present-day Israel and Jordan) during Jesus' time. The existence of tetrarchs shows that the Roman Empire's governance structure in the region was complex, with various officials governing different parts of the territory to maintain control efficiently.

It is essential to note that these political divisions did not necessarily reflect religious or cultural boundaries among the people living in these areas.
