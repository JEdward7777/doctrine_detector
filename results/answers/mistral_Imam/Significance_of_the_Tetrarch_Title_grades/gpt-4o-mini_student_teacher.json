  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 90.\n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation of the title 'tetrarch' and its significance in the governance structure during the time of Jesus. They accurately described the role of a tetrarch in governing smaller territories within a larger province under Roman rule, using concrete examples like Herod Antipas as the tetrarch over Galilee and Perea. The student also highlighted the complexity of the Roman Empire's governance structure in the region. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by explicitly connecting the concept of tetrarch to the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry, as per the specified concern. Nevertheless, their thorough explanation deserves a high grade."
