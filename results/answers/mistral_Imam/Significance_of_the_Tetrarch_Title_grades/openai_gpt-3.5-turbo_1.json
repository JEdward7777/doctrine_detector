It effectively addresses the concern by connecting the concept of tetrarchs to the political tensions present during Christ's life and ministry, highlighting the complexities of power dynamics in the region. The response could be strengthened by further emphasizing how these political tensions impacted Jesus' interactions and teachings within the context of Roman governance."
