  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 70.\n\nThe answer acknowledges the role of signs and miracles in confirming prophethood but correctly points out that belief in these miracles is not mandatory for acceptance of the message in Islam. The response emphasizes the importance of adherence to Allah's teachings and the oneness of God, which are essential components of Islamic faith. However, the answer could have been improved by providing more specific examples of signs and miracles from the Quran and Hadith to support the points made.\n\nOverall, while the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic, it could have been strengthened with deeper engagement with Islamic teachings on signs and miracles as they pertain to confirming God's message through Prophets."
