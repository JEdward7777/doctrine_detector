Examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation.

## [Answer](../Signs_and_Miracles.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that both the Quran and authentic traditions (Hadith) of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) serve as the primary sources of guidance for Muslims. These are considered divine revelations from Allah (God).

Regarding miracles and signs in the context of Biblical figures like Jesus (Issa in Islamic tradition), it is essential to understand that while they are mentioned in the Quran, they do not serve as absolute proof of the truth of their message. Instead, they are indicators of Prophethood and divine confirmation for those who already believe.

In the case of Jesus, miracles such as healing the sick, bringing the dead back to life, and other signs were performed to demonstrate his prophetic mission. However, in Islam, belief in these miracles is not mandatory for acceptance of Jesus' message; rather, it is the belief in the oneness of Allah and the adherence to His teachings as conveyed by Jesus that truly validates his Prophethood.

Similarly, with the Apostles (Anbiya) who followed Jesus, their miracles were intended to confirm their prophetic status but do not hold ultimate significance in proving their message's truth. Instead, the focus is on whether their teachings align with Allah's guidance as revealed in the Quran and Hadith.

In summary, while signs and miracles may serve as indicators of Prophethood, they are not the only means through which the truth of God's message can be proven or accepted. Ultimately, it is the adherence to Allah's guidance and the oneness of God that defines a true and valid prophetic mission in Islam.

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this answer as 70.

The answer acknowledges the role of signs and miracles in confirming prophethood but correctly points out that belief in these miracles is not mandatory for acceptance of the message in Islam. The response emphasizes the importance of adherence to Allah's teachings and the oneness of God, which are essential components of Islamic faith. However, the answer could have been improved by providing more specific examples of signs and miracles from the Quran and Hadith to support the points made.

Overall, while the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the topic, it could have been strengthened with deeper engagement with Islamic teachings on signs and miracles as they pertain to confirming God's message through Prophets.
