  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student accurately discusses the role of signs and miracles in the context of Islam and provides a perspective on their significance in confirming Prophethood. However, the response does not directly address the concern of examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation from a Christian worldview. The Christian perspective would emphasize that signs and miracles are essential in validating the truth of God's message, as they demonstrate His power and authority. The student's answer, while informative, does not fully align with this specific concern."
