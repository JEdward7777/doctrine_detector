They articulate the distinction between miracles as indicators of prophethood rather than absolute proof of the message's truth. \n\nThe student's response aligns with the given concern by exploring the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation in Islam. They also provide relevant examples from the Islamic perspective, including the instances of Jesus and the Apostles.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the significance of signs and miracles within Islamic belief, particularly in the context of establishing the truth of God's message. Additionally, addressing the connection between these miracles and the overall Christian worldview would enhance the response's comprehensiveness."
