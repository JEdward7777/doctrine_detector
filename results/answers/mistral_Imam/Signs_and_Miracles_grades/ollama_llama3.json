  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a clear and concise explanation of the Islamic perspective on signs and miracles in relation to Jesus and the apostles. It effectively addresses the concern by examining the relationship between faith, signs, and God's revelation. The writer highlights that while signs and miracles may serve as indicators of Prophethood, they are not the ultimate proof of a message's truth.\n\nThe response also demonstrates an understanding of the Christian context, referencing Jesus' miracles and the apostles' prophetic status. Additionally, it provides relevant examples from Islamic scripture (Quran and Hadith) to support its claims.\n\nHowever, the response does not explicitly address the idea that signs and miracles serve as validations of God's power and authority, which is the main point of the target answer. While it touches on this idea by mentioning that signs and miracles demonstrate Prophethood, it could have been more explicit in highlighting their role in validating God's message.\n\nOverall, the response provides a well-reasoned and informative discussion of the topic, but could have been even stronger if it had directly addressed the target answer."
