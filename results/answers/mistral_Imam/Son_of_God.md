## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe that all people, including Jesus (peace be upon him), are the children of Adam and Eve, not literally but metaphorically, as we are all part of the human family. The title "Son of God" is a unique Christian belief, rooted in their scripture, which Muslims respect but do not share.

In Islam, God (Allah) has no offspring or partners, and this concept is central to our faith. In contrast, the term "sons of God" as used in the Bible for believers refers metaphorically to those who follow and serve God faithfully.

It's important to remember that peaceful dialogue and understanding between different faith communities can help promote unity and mutual respect. The Islamic perspective on Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of great reverence, as he is considered a prophet and messenger of Allah, sent to guide humanity.
