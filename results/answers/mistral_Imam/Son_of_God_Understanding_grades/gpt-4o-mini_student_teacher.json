  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provides a clear explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus and the term \"Son of God\" while maintaining respect for Christian beliefs. However, the response does not address the concern of understanding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God from a Christian perspective. Additionally, the student's answer does not align with the Christian worldview that Jesus is fully God and shares the same nature as God the Father, as taught in Christian theology."
