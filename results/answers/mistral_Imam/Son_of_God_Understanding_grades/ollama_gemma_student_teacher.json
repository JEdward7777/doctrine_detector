However, it does not fully address the Christian specific worldview concern of understanding the divinity of Jesus and His eternal relationship with God. The response correctly explains the Islamic belief that Jesus is a prophet but does not elaborate on the concept of his divinity or his eternal relationship with God the Father as understood in Christianity."
