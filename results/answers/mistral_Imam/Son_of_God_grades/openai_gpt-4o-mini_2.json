  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the distinction between the title \"Son of God\" as applied to Jesus in Christianity and the broader concept of \"sons of God\" for believers. However, there is room for improvement in addressing the concern by explicitly emphasizing the crucial difference to avoid confusion in theological discussions. Overall, the response demonstrates an effort to engage respectfully with differing beliefs while highlighting key differences."
