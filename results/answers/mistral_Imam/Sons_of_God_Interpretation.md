## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, the term "sons of God" used in the Bible does not refer to biological offspring or literal sons, but rather metaphorical expressions. Muslims believe that the Quran provides the correct interpretation and understanding of biblical texts where such terms are used.

In Genesis 6:2, when it says, "The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them," Muslims understand this as referring to angels who intermarried with human women, producing offspring known as the Nephilim (giant beings). This interpretation is based on the Quranic verse 21:73, which describes angels as "messengers with wings—two or three or four. He [Allah] adds to them in number and He withdraws from them. Verily Allah is the One Who has power over all things."

However, it is essential to note that Islamic interpretations of biblical texts do not always align with those found within different Christian denominations. Some Christians believe the "sons of God" refer to righteous people (children of Seth) or, more controversially, to Jesus Christ himself. Nevertheless, these interpretations are not shared by Muslims and are considered non-canonical from an Islamic perspective.

In summary, in Genesis 6:2, Muslims interpret the "sons of God" as referring to angels who intermarried with human women, producing offspring known as the Nephilim. This interpretation is based on the understanding that angels are messengers of Allah and do not have the ability to procreate like humans.
