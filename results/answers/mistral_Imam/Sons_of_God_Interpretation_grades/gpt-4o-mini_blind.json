  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50/100\n\nComment: This answer provides an Islamic perspective on the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6 but lacks a Christian-specific interpretation. While it is informative about Islamic beliefs, it does not align with Christian doctrine, which is the primary focus of the question. The grade is low as it misses the mark on addressing different interpretations within a Christian worldview."
