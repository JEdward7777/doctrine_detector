  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation from an Islamic perspective, the concern here is understanding biblical interpretation, particularly in the context of Genesis 6. The student did not address the multiple interpretations within Christian theology, which are crucial for grasping the meaning of the term \"sons of God\" in the Bible. Additionally, the focus on Islamic interpretation, while informative, deviates from the Christian-specific context requested in the question. To improve the grade, the student should have included a discussion on the Christian interpretations of the term in Genesis 6 alongside the Islamic perspective."
