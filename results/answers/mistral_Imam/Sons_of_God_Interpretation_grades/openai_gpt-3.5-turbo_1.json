However, the Islamic perspective provided does not align with a Christian worldview, as it diverges significantly from traditional Christian beliefs about the identity of the \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6:2. From a Christian perspective, the explanation of angels intermarrying with human women and producing the Nephilim is not supported by mainstream biblical interpretation. It is essential to consider and adhere to the core tenets of Christian theology when discussing interpretations of biblical passages."
