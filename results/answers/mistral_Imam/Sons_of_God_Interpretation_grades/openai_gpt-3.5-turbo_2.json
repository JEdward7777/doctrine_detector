  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the Islamic interpretation regarding the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6:2 based on the belief that angels intermarried with human women. The student effectively demonstrates an understanding of how different religious traditions interpret biblical texts. However, the response does not effectively address the specified concern about how understanding biblical interpretation aids in grasping the meaning of scripture passages. The student could have elaborated more on how differing interpretations impact one's understanding of biblical teachings."
