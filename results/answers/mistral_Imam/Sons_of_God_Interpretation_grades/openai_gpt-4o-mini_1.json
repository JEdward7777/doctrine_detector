  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on the interpretation of the term \"sons of God\" in Genesis 6:2, which is informative and well-structured. However, from a Christian worldview, the grade is lower because it does not address the concern about understanding biblical interpretation to grasp the meaning of scripture passages. The response focuses solely on the Islamic perspective and does not engage with the Christian interpretation provided in the given answer. To improve the grade, there should have been a comparison or discussion of how different interpretations impact the understanding of the scripture passage."
