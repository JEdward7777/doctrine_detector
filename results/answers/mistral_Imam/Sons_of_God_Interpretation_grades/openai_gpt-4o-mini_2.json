While it does offer an alternative interpretation from an Islamic viewpoint, it does not engage with the importance of studying and understanding different interpretations across various religious traditions to fully comprehend the biblical text. The response could be improved by emphasizing the significance of diverse interpretations in shedding light on the deeper meanings of scripture passages and fostering a more holistic understanding of religious texts."
