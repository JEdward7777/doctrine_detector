  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the concept of saints in Christianity and the different processes for recognizing saints in various denominations. However, the answer does not clearly emphasize the central role of faith in Jesus Christ as the source of holiness for believers becoming saints, which is a key concern in the Christian doctrine. The reference answer succinctly highlights this central aspect, and the student's response could be improved by explicitly connecting the concept of saints to the saving work of Jesus Christ through faith."
