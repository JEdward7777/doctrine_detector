  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer adequately addresses the question and demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of sainthood in Christianity. It provides a clear explanation of the different ways in which the term \"saint\" is used and the processes involved in recognizing a saint in both the Catholic and Orthodox traditions. Additionally, the student acknowledges the differences between Christian saints and the Islamic concept of \"awliya.\" \n\nHowever, the answer could be improved by explicitly addressing the concern related to the central role of faith in the Christian doctrine of sainthood. The student's answer currently focuses on the external processes and definitions of sainthood, but it does not fully connect this to the idea of faith as the source of holiness."
