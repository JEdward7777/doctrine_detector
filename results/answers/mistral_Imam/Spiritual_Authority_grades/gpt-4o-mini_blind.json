  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a decent explanation of the distinction between spiritual authorities and earthly authorities according to Biblical teaching. The reference to Romans 13:1-2 is appropriate in highlighting the divine establishment of earthly authorities. However, the answer could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the importance of submitting to both types of authorities as ordained by God. Additionally, bringing in references to Islamic teaching, while informative, may distract from the focus on Christian-specific perspectives. Overall, a solid effort but room for improvement in clarity and doctrinal emphasis."
