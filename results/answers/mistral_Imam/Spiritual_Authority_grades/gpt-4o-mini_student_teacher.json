  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-structured response that addresses the distinction between spiritual and earthly authorities in Christianity. They explain the roles of each type of authority and reference key Biblical teachings. However, the student could strengthen their answer by focusing more on the specific Biblical teachings that highlight the differences between spiritual and earthly authorities, rather than delving into the historical context within Christianity and drawing parallels with Islamic teachings. Additionally, the student should include more direct scriptural references to support their points, aligning more closely with a Christian-specific worldview."
