  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student provides a thorough and insightful analysis of the role of demons in the deception of idolatry according to Islamic teachings. They accurately highlight Shaytan's influence in sowing doubt about Allah's Oneness, encouraging reliance on other entities, and promoting false beliefs. The inclusion of Quranic verses and Hadith adds credibility and depth to the response. While the response focuses on Islamic beliefs, it effectively addresses the concern of spiritual deceit relevant to Christians as well."
