It effectively highlights the importance of seeking guidance from Allah and the Prophet Muhammad to combat this deception. The concern of remaining vigilant against spiritual deceit aligns well with the Christian worldview, emphasizing the need for Christians to be steadfast in their faith and resist influences that may lead them away from the truth of God's sovereignty."
