  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student attempted to provide an explanation based on Islamic perspectives, the question specifically asked for an analysis of the concept of \"spiritual gifts\" as described in the Bible. The student should have focused on Christian beliefs and interpretations regarding spiritual gifts. Additionally, in a Christian worldview, the belief is that spiritual gifts are given by the Holy Spirit, rather than as general blessings from God as emphasized in Islam. The response lacked doctrinal correctness in addressing the implications of spiritual gifts within Christianity."
