  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's response, while informative about the Islamic perspective on spiritual gifts, did not directly address the Christian understanding as described in the Bible. The concern specified the importance of utilizing spiritual gifts for community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit, which the student did not effectively engage with in their response. Additionally, the student did not incorporate a Christian-specific worldview in their analysis."
