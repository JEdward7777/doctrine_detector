  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Christian perspective on spiritual gifts and effectively compares it to the Islamic concept of Allah's favors and blessings. The response is well-researched and provides relevant textual references from both the Quran and the Bible. However, the absence of direct engagement with the specified concern regarding community growth and personal obedience to the Holy Spirit slightly lowers the grade."
