  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response addresses the concept of spiritual gifts from a Muslim perspective, which shows some understanding of the issue at hand. However, it lacks direct connection to the original answer and concern provided. While the response does mention the idea of special abilities or blessings coming from Allah, it doesn't explicitly relate this to building up the church or serving others in love, as stated in the original answer. Additionally, the response could have explored how the Muslim perspective on spiritual gifts might intersect with the Christian understanding, which is the concern being addressed. Overall, while the response demonstrates some effort to engage with the topic, it falls short of fully addressing the original answer and concern."
