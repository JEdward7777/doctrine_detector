While it acknowledges similarities between the concept of \"spiritual gifts\" in Christianity and \"blessings\" in Islam, it fails to address the fundamental Christian belief that spiritual gifts are imparted by the Holy Spirit for the specific purpose of building up the church and serving others in love. The response also does not address the importance of personal obedience to the Holy Spirit in utilizing these gifts for community growth."
