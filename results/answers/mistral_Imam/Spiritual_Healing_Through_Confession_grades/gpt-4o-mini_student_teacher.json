However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the concern of the importance of community in spiritual growth, as emphasized in the reference answer. Additionally, while the student did a good job of explaining the significance of seeking forgiveness in Islam, there was a lack of specific connection to how confessing sins to one another contributes to spiritual healing within a community context."
