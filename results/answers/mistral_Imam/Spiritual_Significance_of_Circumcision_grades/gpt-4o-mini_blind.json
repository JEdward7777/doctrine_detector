  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of \"circumcision of the heart\" in a Christian context, referencing key biblical passages and explaining the spiritual significance of this metaphorical expression. The answer could be improved by incorporating more references to the New Testament, where the concept is further expounded upon by Jesus and other apostles. Additionally, emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in this process of inner transformation would enhance the theological depth of the response."
