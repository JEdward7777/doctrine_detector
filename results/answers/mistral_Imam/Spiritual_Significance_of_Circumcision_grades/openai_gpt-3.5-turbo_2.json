The connection to faith in Jesus Christ for the removal of sin and purification of the heart is clearly articulated. It effectively addresses the concern by distinguishing the spiritual significance from physical practices in modern Christianity. Overall, the response demonstrates a well-rounded understanding from a Christian worldview."
