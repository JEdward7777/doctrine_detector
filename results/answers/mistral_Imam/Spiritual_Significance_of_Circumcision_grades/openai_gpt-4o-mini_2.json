It effectively expands on the given answer, emphasizing the metaphorical nature of this concept and its significance in the context of faith and salvation. The concern raised is addressed well by distinguishing the spiritual symbolism from the physical practice of circumcision in modern Christianity. Overall, a well-articulated and insightful response from a Christian worldview."
