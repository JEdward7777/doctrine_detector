  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the significance of Stephen's stoning in the early Christian church, touching on key points such as persecution, faithfulness, and the spread of the Gospel message. The answer effectively reflects on the cost of discipleship and the importance of faithfulness in the face of persecution, aligning well with the specified concern. The only area of improvement would be to focus more on how Stephen's martyrdom specifically exemplifies the cost of discipleship and the need for unwavering faithfulness in the face of persecution."
