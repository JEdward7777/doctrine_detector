## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic tradition, the Quran is our primary source of guidance, and we do not use the Bible to derive Islamic law (Shariah). However, since you asked about the Bible, it is important to note that the practice of stoning as a punishment for adultery is mentioned in the Old Testament (Leviticus 20:10), but its interpretation and application have been subject to significant debate among Jews and Christians throughout history.

In the New Testament, Jesus does not explicitly discuss the issue of stoning for adultery, but he does criticize the religious leaders' hypocrisy (Matthew 7:5) and emphasizes mercy, forgiveness, and love as core principles (Matthew 18:21-22; Matthew 22:39).

From an Islamic perspective, the Quran explicitly condemns adultery (Surah An-Nisa, verse 15) but does not prescribe stoning as a punishment for this offense. Instead, it emphasizes reconciliation and forgiveness (Surah An-Nuur, verses 3-4). In Islamic law, the testimony required to convict someone of adultery is very strict, and even then, the punishment is flogging, not stoning.

Regarding God's justice and mercy, both are essential attributes of God in all Abrahamic traditions. However, interpretations of how these attributes should be applied in specific circumstances can vary widely. In the Islamic tradition, the emphasis on mercy and compassion is significant, as reflected in the Hadith Qudsi, where Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) quotes God saying: "I am as My servant thinks I am." This highlights the importance of striving to understand and embody God's attributes in our actions and interactions.
