However, the focus on the Bible and the lack of exploration into Islamic perspectives on the same topic are significant limitations. To further address the concern about the balance between God's justice and mercy, it would be beneficial to delve deeper into both biblical and Quranic teachings, as well as explore how these attributes are applied in different contexts. Nevertheless, this response provides a solid foundation for understanding the biblical perspective on stoning for adultery and its connection to the broader theme of God's justice and mercy."
