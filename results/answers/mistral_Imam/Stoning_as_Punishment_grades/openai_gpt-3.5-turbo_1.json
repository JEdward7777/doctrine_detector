It addresses the concern by highlighting the tension between God's justice and mercy in His commandments. However, the focus is solely on the Biblical narratives and lacks a deeper exploration of how the balance of justice and mercy is perceived and applied within the Christian worldview outside of the specific instances mentioned. A more thorough analysis incorporating theological perspectives on God's nature and the application of His commandments could enhance the response."
