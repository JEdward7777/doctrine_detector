It acknowledges the importance of understanding God's justice and mercy in interpreting and applying divine commandments. The integration of relevant biblical and Quranic references enhances the analysis and demonstrates a thoughtful engagement with the concern raised. Great job at addressing the balance between God's justice and mercy in His commandments from a comparative religious standpoint."
