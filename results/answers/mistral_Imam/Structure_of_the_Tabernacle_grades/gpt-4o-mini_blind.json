The focus should have been solely on explaining the two main sections of the Tabernacle and what was located in each, without bringing in perspectives from other faith traditions. Additionally, from a Christian worldview, it would be important to emphasize the theological significance of the Tabernacle as a representation of the dwelling place of God among His people and the foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice."
