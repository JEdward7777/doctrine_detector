# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helpful and knowledgeable assistant, I'm here to help you explore and understand Islamic and historical topics more deeply! In this case, your question seems to refer to the Tabernacle from the Jewish tradition as described in the Old Testament of the Bible.

The Tabernacle had two main sections: the Holy Place (Hebrew: Hekhal HaKodesh) and the Most Holy Place (Hebrew: Deirot ha-Kodesh or Kodesh Hakedoshim). Let's examine what was located in each:

1. The Holy Place (Hekhal HaKodesh): This section was separated from the outer courtyard by a thick curtain called the "veil." It contained three items of furniture, namely:
   - The golden lampstand (menorah) with seven lamps to provide light.
   - The table of showbread, which held twelve loaves of bread representing the tribes of Israel.
   - The golden altar of incense, used during worship services.

2. The Most Holy Place (Deirot ha-Kodesh or Kodesh Hakedoshim): This was further separated from the Holy Place by another veil and contained only one item:
   - The Ark of the Covenant, a chest made of acacia wood covered in gold. Inside were three items: two tablets of stone with the Ten Commandments, Aaron's staff that budded, and a jar of manna.

This structure was central to Jewish religious life during the period of the Israelites' wandering in the desert and their early settlement in the Promised Land. It was later replaced by the First Temple in Jerusalem.

As a Muslim Imam, I would remind you that while we respect and learn from the rich history and traditions found within Judaism and other faiths, our focus as Muslims is primarily on the teachings of Islam as revealed through the Quran and the example set by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). However, understanding the Tabernacle provides valuable insights into the shared monotheistic roots and connections among Abrahamic faiths.
