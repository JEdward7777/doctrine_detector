  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed and insightful answer from an Islamic perspective, highlighting key symbolic meanings of manna in Islam related to divine mercy, sustenance for the needy, trust in Allah, and gratitude. While the answer was well-written and showcased a deep understanding of the topic within an Islamic framework, the concern specified a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student should have focused more on the Christian interpretation of manna and God's provision for believers from that perspective."
