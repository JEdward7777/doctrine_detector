  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how the metaphor of the cornerstone relates to Jesus and his followers in the Islamic context, highlighting important aspects of foundational role, crucial importance, unity, cohesion, and guidance. However, the student's answer did not fully align with the Christian-specific worldview provided in the reference answer. In Christian belief, Jesus is not merely a prophet, but the Son of God and the central figure of salvation history. The grade reflects the detailed analysis provided by the student, but deducts points for not fully incorporating the Christian perspective on the divinity and unique role of Jesus as the cornerstone of faith."
