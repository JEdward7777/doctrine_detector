While relevant to the overall discussion of Jesus as the cornerstone, it would be more appropriate to address the Christian perspective for full credit.\n* The conclusion could be strengthened by explicitly connecting the metaphor of the cornerstone to the idea of Jesus as the source of strength and reference point for believers' lives and faith.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe student has presented a well-written and insightful response that demonstrates a deep understanding of the metaphor of the cornerstone in the relationship between Jesus and his followers. However, addressing the Christian perspective and strengthening the conclusion would elevate the quality of the answer to fully align with the prompt."
