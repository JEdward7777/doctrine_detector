  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the cornerstone metaphor and its application to the relationship between Jesus and his followers. It highlights the foundational role, crucial importance, unity, and guidance that Jesus provides, which aligns well with the specified concern of helping believers align their lives with Christ's teachings and example.\n\nThe response could be improved by more explicitly connecting the metaphorical applications back to the original concern. For instance, it could be shown how the cornerstone metaphor can help individuals understand their own role in building upon Jesus' foundation or finding guidance from his teachings.\n\nOverall, the response provides a clear and concise explanation of the cornerstone metaphor and its significance for believers, making it a strong candidate for an 85-grade."
