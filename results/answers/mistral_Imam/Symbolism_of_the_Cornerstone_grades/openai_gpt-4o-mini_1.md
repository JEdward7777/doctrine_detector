 In Islamic understanding, Jesus (peace be upon him) is considered one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity. The metaphor of the cornerstone, when applied to the relationship between Jesus and his followers, can illustrate their bond in several ways:

1. Foundational Role: Just as a cornerstone is placed first and serves as the foundation upon which a building is erected, Jesus' mission was essential for establishing the teachings and values that form the basis of Christianity. His followers have built upon these foundations, spreading his message and upholding its principles.

2. Crucial Importance: The cornerstone holds significant weight in a structure, supporting the entire edifice. Similarly, Jesus' role as a prophet was indispensable for the guidance of humanity, and his followers carry forward this crucial mission in their lives.

3. Unity and Cohesion: In architecture, a well-laid cornerstone ensures that all parts of the building align correctly. Likewise, by following the teachings of Jesus, his followers strive to foster unity among people, embodying the spirit of brotherhood and compassion that he embodied.

4. Guidance for Future Generations: A cornerstone is a point of reference for future construction efforts. Similarly, the life and teachings of Jesus serve as an enduring source of guidance for his followers and generations to come.
