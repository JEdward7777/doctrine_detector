The answer focuses more on Islamic beliefs and practices, rather than delving deeply into the Christian understanding of sacrificial atonement, particularly through the lens of Jesus Christ as the ultimate sacrificial Lamb. A more in-depth exploration of the theological implications of the sacrificial system in the Bible and its fulfillment in Christ would significantly enhance the response."
