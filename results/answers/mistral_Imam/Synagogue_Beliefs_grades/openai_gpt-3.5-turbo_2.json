The explanation captures the essence of the concern regarding the communal aspect and significance of gathering in worship, aligning well with a Christian worldview that values community and fellowship in worship. However, incorporating more references to Islamic teachings or scriptures to support the points made would further strengthen the response from a theological perspective."
