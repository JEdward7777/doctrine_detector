The connection to the communal nature of worship and the importance of unity, spiritual growth, and pursuit of knowledge in Islam is well-articulated. However, a more explicit reference to the figurative aspect of the term 'synagogue' in relation to the group of people who gather for worship would have further enhanced the response."
