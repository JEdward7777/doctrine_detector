However, the answer does not directly address the concern of understanding the role of the temple in the context of Old Testament worship. While it mentions the purpose of the temple in Islamic tradition, it falls short of providing a comparison or explanation of its significance within the Old Testament context. Strengthening the connection between the Old Testament worship practices and the purpose of the temple would have enhanced the response."
