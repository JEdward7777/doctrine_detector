From a Christian worldview, the significance of Zion is deeply rooted in Old Testament prophecies and the establishment of God's dwelling place among His people. The answer would benefit from addressing the Christian perspective with more theological and biblical insights to provide a well-rounded view on the association of Zion with the temple in Jerusalem."
