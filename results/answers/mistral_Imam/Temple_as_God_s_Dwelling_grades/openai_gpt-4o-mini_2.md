 In the Old Testament, the temple was considered a physical structure where God's presence dwelled among His people. The first temple was built by King Solomon (around 965-930 BCE) according to the plans given by God (1 Kings 6:14), and it stood in Jerusalem. This temple housed the Ark of the Covenant, a symbolic chest that contained the Ten Commandments tablets (Exodus 25:22).

The Second Temple was built after the Babylonian captivity and was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. The concept of God's dwelling among His people was not limited to the temple, as it was also expressed through the Tabernacle (the mobile sanctuary used during the wilderness wanderings) and the presence of the shekinah glory - God's immanent presence.

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is considered the new Temple (John 2:19-21), as His death and resurrection make it possible for believers to have a spiritual relationship with God without relying on a physical temple. This is highlighted in the Book of Hebrews, where it states that "we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all" (Hebrews 10:10).

In Islam, the concept of God's dwelling among His creation is expressed differently. In the Quran, Muslims believe that Allah (SWT) is not confined to any space or place (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:115), and there is no physical equivalent to a temple in Islam. Instead, Muslims seek nearness to God through righteous actions and prayer, as well as through seeking knowledge and striving for justice.
