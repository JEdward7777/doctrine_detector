From a Christian worldview, Jesus, fully God and fully man, resisted Satan's temptations in the wilderness through His reliance on the Word of God and His perfect obedience to the Father. The Islamic perspective presented goes against core Christian teachings on the nature and actions of Jesus during the temptations."
