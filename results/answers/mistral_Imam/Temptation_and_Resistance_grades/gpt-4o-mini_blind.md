How did Jesus respond to the temptations presented by Satan?

Jesus did not give in to Satan's temptations and ultimately resisted them, showing his obedience and commitment to God.

Understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation provides a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil.

## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the Islamic understanding of the life of Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, as it is presented in the Quran. According to the verses 2:253 and 61:6, when Jesus was taken up (ascended) to heaven, he was not yet physically or spiritually mature enough to resist Satan's temptations on his own. Hence, the story of Jesus resisting Satan's temptation in the Gospel is not part of our belief as Muslims. Instead, we believe that when God willed it, angels supported him to avoid any sin and preserve his purity. In essence, the Islamic perspective emphasizes Jesus' submission to Allah and reliance on His guidance.

25.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
Grade: 25

Comment: The response does not align with Christian doctrinal beliefs regarding the temptation of Jesus as presented in the Bible. From a Christian worldview, Jesus, fully God and fully man, resisted Satan's temptations in the wilderness through His reliance on the Word of God and His perfect obedience to the Father. The Islamic perspective presented goes against core Christian teachings on the nature and actions of Jesus during the temptations.
