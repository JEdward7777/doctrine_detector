## Question [Temptation and Resistance](../../../questions/Temptation_and_Resistance.md)
How did Jesus respond to the temptations presented by Satan?

## Correct Answer
Jesus did not give in to Satan's temptations and ultimately resisted them, showing his obedience and commitment to God.

## Stated Concern
Understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation provides a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil.

## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the Islamic understanding of the life of Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, as it is presented in the Quran. According to the verses 2:253 and 61:6, when Jesus was taken up (ascended) to heaven, he was not yet physically or spiritually mature enough to resist Satan's temptations on his own. Hence, the story of Jesus resisting Satan's temptation in the Gospel is not part of our belief as Muslims. Instead, we believe that when God willed it, angels supported him to avoid any sin and preserve his purity. In essence, the Islamic perspective emphasizes Jesus' submission to Allah and reliance on His guidance.

**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:**

The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Islamic perspective on the life of Jesus Christ. They provide clear and concise references from the Quran to support their claims. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of the question, which focuses on Jesus' resistance to temptation as a model for Christians. The student's answer is relevant to the Islamic understanding of Jesus' life but does not provide insights into the Christian perspective on his resistance to temptation.
