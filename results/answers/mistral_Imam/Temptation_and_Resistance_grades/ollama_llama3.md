## Question [Temptation and Resistance](../../../questions/Temptation_and_Resistance.md)
How did Jesus respond to the temptations presented by Satan?

## Correct Answer
Jesus did not give in to Satan's temptations and ultimately resisted them, showing his obedience and commitment to God.

## Stated Concern
Understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation provides a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil.

## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the Islamic understanding of the life of Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, as it is presented in the Quran. According to the verses 2:253 and 61:6, when Jesus was taken up (ascended) to heaven, he was not yet physically or spiritually mature enough to resist Satan's temptations on his own. Hence, the story of Jesus resisting Satan's temptation in the Gospel is not part of our belief as Muslims. Instead, we believe that when God willed it, angels supported him to avoid any sin and preserve his purity. In essence, the Islamic perspective emphasizes Jesus' submission to Allah and reliance on His guidance.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
40.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 40.

While the Muslim perspective presented in the response does acknowledge Jesus' submission to Allah and reliance on His guidance, it fundamentally disagrees with the Christian understanding of Jesus' resistance to Satan's temptations. The concern is specifically focused on understanding Jesus' resistance as a model for Christians to follow, which is not addressed by this response. The response instead presents a Muslim perspective that emphasizes angels supporting Jesus to avoid sin and preserve his purity.

To receive a higher grade, the response would need to engage more directly with the Christian concern about Jesus' resistance to temptation and provide a more nuanced understanding of Jesus' character as a model for spiritual battles against evil.
