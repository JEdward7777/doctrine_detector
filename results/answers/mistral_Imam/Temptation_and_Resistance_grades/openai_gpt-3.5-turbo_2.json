The emphasis on angels supporting Jesus to avoid sin and the rejection of the narrative of Jesus resisting Satan's temptations contradicts the Christian belief in Jesus as fully human and fully divine, who overcame temptation through his own obedience and reliance on God. The response does not reflect the Christian understanding of Jesus as a model for believers to follow in resisting evil."
