## Question [Temptation and Resistance](../../../questions/Temptation_and_Resistance.md)
How did Jesus respond to the temptations presented by Satan?

## Correct Answer
Jesus did not give in to Satan's temptations and ultimately resisted them, showing his obedience and commitment to God.

## Stated Concern
Understanding Jesus' resistance to temptation provides a model for Christians to follow in their own spiritual battles against evil.

## [Answer](../Temptation_and_Resistance.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the Islamic understanding of the life of Prophet Isa (Jesus), peace be upon him, as it is presented in the Quran. According to the verses 2:253 and 61:6, when Jesus was taken up (ascended) to heaven, he was not yet physically or spiritually mature enough to resist Satan's temptations on his own. Hence, the story of Jesus resisting Satan's temptation in the Gospel is not part of our belief as Muslims. Instead, we believe that when God willed it, angels supported him to avoid any sin and preserve his purity. In essence, the Islamic perspective emphasizes Jesus' submission to Allah and reliance on His guidance.

Grade: 30

Comment: While the response provided a clear explanation of the Islamic belief regarding Prophet Isa (Jesus), it deviated from the Christian specific worldview by not acknowledging the significance of Jesus' resistance to temptation as a model for Christians. From a Christian perspective, Jesus' victory over temptation is a central aspect of his role as the perfect example for believers. Thus, the response only partially addressed the concern raised.
