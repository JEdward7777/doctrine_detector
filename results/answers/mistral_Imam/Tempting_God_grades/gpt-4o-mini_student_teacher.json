  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer as 70. \n\nThe student provided a comprehensive explanation of the concept of 'tempting God' from an Islamic perspective and made an effort to relate it to the Biblical concept mentioned in the reference answer. They also referenced a relevant Biblical passage to support their point. However, the answer could have been improved by directly addressing the Biblical concept without primarily focusing on Islamic teachings. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the implications and consequences of 'tempting God' according to Biblical teaching.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrated understanding of the topic but could improve by providing a more focused analysis within a Christian-specific worldview."
