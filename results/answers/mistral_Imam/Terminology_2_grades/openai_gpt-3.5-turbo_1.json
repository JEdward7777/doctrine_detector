  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the terms used within Christianity to refer to the Lord's Supper, including 'communion' and 'Last Supper'. It accurately identifies some common terms associated with the sacrament, showing a solid grasp of the topic. The response could have been stronger by providing a more in-depth explanation of each term and their significance within Christian belief and practice. But overall, it shows a clear understanding of the concern."
