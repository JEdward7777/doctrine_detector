## [Answer](../Terminology_2.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Christian communities, there are several terms used to refer to the sacrament that is central to the Eucharist or Holy Communion, which is roughly equivalent to the Islamic practice of breaking fast together during Suhur and Iftar during Ramadan. Here are some of them:

1. Lord's Supper - This term is often used to refer to the entire ritual of remembrance of Christ's last supper with his disciples, including prayers, hymns, and the actual sacrament itself.

2. Eucharist (also called the Holy Eucharist or the Blessed Sacrament) - This is the central rite of the traditional Christian liturgy found within East Syrian, Western, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Roman Catholic churches. In some traditions, such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, it's also called Divine Liturgy.

3. Holy Communion - A service in which bread and wine are consecrated and consumed, representing the body and blood of Christ.

4. The Sacrament of the Altar - In Lutheran churches, this term is often used for Holy Communion.

5. Mass (or the Holy Mass) - In the Roman Catholic Church, the term "Mass" refers to the Eucharistic service where bread and wine are consecrated and consumed. The word 'mass' comes from the Latin word 'missa', which means 'dismissal'.

6. Agape Feast (or Love Feast) - In some traditions, such as the Early Church or the Jehovah's Witnesses, this term is used to refer to a communal meal shared by believers, but not necessarily involving the sacrament of Holy Communion.
