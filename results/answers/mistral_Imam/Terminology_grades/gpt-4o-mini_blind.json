  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The answer provides a comprehensive list of alternative terms within Islamic terminology that may correspond to the roles of a deacon in a Christian context. The student accurately identifies various positions within an Islamic community that involve leadership, administration, and spiritual responsibilities. The answer demonstrates understanding and knowledge of the topic. However, the grading is not higher as the response does not explicitly address the Christian perspective or terminology, which is the focus of the question. Additionally, more explanation could have been provided on how these roles relate to or differ from the role of a deacon in Christianity."
