## [Answer](../Terminology.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic terminology, there isn't an exact equivalent to the Christian term "deacon." However, within the administrative structure of a mosque or Islamic community, the roles may be fulfilled by individuals holding titles such as:

1. Khateeb (Arabic): The person who delivers the khutbah (sermon) during Friday prayers and on other occasions. This individual is often also responsible for leading the congregational prayers.

2. Imam (Arabic): The leader of the congregational prayer, as well as the religious and administrative head of a mosque or Islamic community.

3. Mu'azzin (Arabic): The person who gives the call to prayer (adhan) and leads other prayers at the mosque.

4. Qari (Arabic): A person who specializes in reciting the Quran with proper pronunciation and intonation, often leading the recitation during congregational prayers.

5. Sadr or Ameer (Arabic/Urdu): The head of a local Muslim organization or community, responsible for its administration and religious guidance.

These roles may be held by different individuals within an Islamic community, depending on their skills and responsibilities. It is important to note that while these roles are administrative and organizational in nature, they are also spiritual positions requiring knowledge of Islam and piety from the individuals filling them.
