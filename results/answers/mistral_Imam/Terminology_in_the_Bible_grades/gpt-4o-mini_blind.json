However, it lacks doctrinal correctness by not explicitly stating that the terms \"Israelites,\" \"Hebrews,\" and \"Children of Israel\" specifically refer to the descendants of Jacob, who was renamed Israel by God. The mention of seeking knowledge from diverse sources, while important in some contexts, is not necessary in this specific question seeking biblical terminology. The response could be improved by emphasizing the unique relationship between God and the descendants of Jacob as highlighted in the Bible."
