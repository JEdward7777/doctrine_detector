## [Answer](../Terminology_in_the_Bible.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or affiliations. However, in the biblical context, the terms "Israelites," "Hebrews," and "Children of Israel" are often used to refer to God's chosen people, specifically the descendants of Jacob (also known as Israel). These terms reflect the historical narrative of a specific group of people who were chosen by God to receive His covenant and through whom the Messiah was promised to come. It's important to remember that interpretations may vary among different religious groups, and it's always beneficial to seek knowledge and understanding from diverse sources.
