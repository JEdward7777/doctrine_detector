  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and well-explained response regarding why it is considered wrong to put God to the test in Islam, drawing upon Quranic verses and hadiths to support their points. The explanation was clear and demonstrated an understanding of the theological principles behind this belief. Additionally, the student effectively conveyed the consequences of testing God according to Islamic teachings. However, the answer could be improved by providing more specific examples or references to support certain points and by further emphasizing the doctrinal reasons behind this belief."
