  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation rooted in Islamic teachings regarding why it is discouraged to put Allah to the test. They demonstrated a good understanding of the concept and supported their points with references from the Quran and the Sunnah. However, the student's answer did not directly address the concern about maintaining a proper relationship with God, which is crucial in the context of the question. Encouraging the student to relate their answer more explicitly to the importance of maintaining a respectful and faithful relationship with God would strengthen their response."
