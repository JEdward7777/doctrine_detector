  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of why putting God to the test is discouraged in Islam, citing Quranic verses and Sunnah teachings as evidence. It also highlights the potential consequences of such an action. While the response does not specifically address the concern about maintaining a proper relationship with God, it indirectly touches on this theme by emphasizing the importance of having faith in Allah's wisdom and relying on Him for one's needs. The only area for improvement is that the response could have more explicitly connected the principle of not putting God to the test with the concern of maintaining a proper relationship with God."
