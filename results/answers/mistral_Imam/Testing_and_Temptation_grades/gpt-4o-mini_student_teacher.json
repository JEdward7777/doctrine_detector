  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's response as 60.\n\nWhile the student's answer provides a detailed comparison between the concepts of testing and temptation in Islamic and Christian traditions, the concern specifically asks for a Christian worldview perspective. The response makes correlations between the Islamic concepts and provides an insightful analysis. However, it falls short in addressing the specific concern of differentiating testing from temptation within a biblical context. The student could have provided a more in-depth explanation of how the two concepts are distinct in Christianity, focusing on the biblical references and teachings that support this differentiation. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but lacks the required emphasis on a Christian worldview perspective."
