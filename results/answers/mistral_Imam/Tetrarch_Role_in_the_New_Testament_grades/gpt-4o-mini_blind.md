## [Answer](../Tetrarch_Role_in_the_New_Testament.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the New Testament, Herod Antipas, also known as Herod the Tetrarch, plays a significant role in the accounts of Jesus Christ's life. He is most famously associated with two key events:

1. John the Baptist and Salome's Dance: According to the Gospels of Mark (6:14-29) and Matthew (14:1-12), Herod Antipas imprisoned John the Baptist for rebuking him for his marriage to Herodias, his brother's wife. During a feast, Herodias' daughter, Salome, danced before the guests and as a reward, Herod promised to grant her any request. At her mother's prompting, she asked for John the Baptist's head on a platter, which was fulfilled.

2. The Trial of Jesus: In the Gospels of Matthew (27:1-10), Luke (3:1), and Mark (6:14), Herod Antipas is part of the group that accuses Jesus during His trial. He questions Jesus, but Jesus does not respond to any of his questions. Afterward, he sends Jesus to Pilate for punishment.

Herod Antipas' actions towards John the Baptist and his role in Jesus Christ's trials serve as important narrative elements in the New Testament, demonstrating the political and religious tensions that existed during this period in Judea.
