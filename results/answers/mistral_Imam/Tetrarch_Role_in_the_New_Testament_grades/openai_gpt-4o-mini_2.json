It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the significance of understanding the historical and biblical context of Herod Antipas for interpreting the narratives of the New Testament. The use of specific references to the Gospels adds credibility to the explanation. Overall, a strong response with a clear Christian worldview perspective."
