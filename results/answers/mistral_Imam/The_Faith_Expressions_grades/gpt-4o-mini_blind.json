However, the answer does not address the question within the context of belief in Jesus from a Christian perspective. It lacks an explanation of the Christian understanding of \"keeping the faith\" in relation to Jesus as the Son of God, Savior, and the importance of faith in Him for salvation. The focus on Islamic beliefs about Jesus, while informative, does not align with the Christian-specific worldview requested in the question."
