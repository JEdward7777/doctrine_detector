## [Answer](../The_Faith_Expressions.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, the phrase "keep the faith" is often understood as maintaining one's faithfulness to the teachings of Islam as outlined in the Quran and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, when it comes to belief in Jesus, Muslims believe that he was a prophet sent by Allah and that he spoke truth from God.

In this context, "keeping the faith" could also mean acknowledging Jesus as a Messenger of Allah, respecting his teachings, and not attributing anything to him beyond what is attributed to him according to Islamic belief, such as divinity or Trinity. Muslims believe in Jesus's miracles, his virgin birth, and that he will descend at the end of times (Masih ad-Dajjal).

Therefore, "keeping the faith" in terms of Jesus could be seen as accepting his prophethood, honoring his teachings, and anticipating his second coming as foretold by Islamic prophecies. It's important to note that Muslim beliefs about Jesus are unique from Christian beliefs and are based on the teachings of Islam.
