The inclusion of relevant Bible reference (Matthew 28:19-20) and explanation of the significance of this command in spreading the teachings of Jesus aligns well with the concern of understanding the mission of discipleship. The only slight deduction is for briefly mentioning the Islamic perspective initially, which while providing context, could have been more succinct to focus primarily on the Christian worldview. Overall, a strong response demonstrating understanding and application of Christian teachings."
