  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Great Commission and its significance. It effectively cites the relevant biblical passage and clearly explains the command to make disciples, baptize, and teach. However, the answer is biased towards an Islamic perspective, which is not relevant to the Christian-specific worldview specified in the concern."
