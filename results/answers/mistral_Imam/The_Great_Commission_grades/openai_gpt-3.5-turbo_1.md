# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, as we believe that Islam is the final revelation, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is considered the last messenger of Allah, and Jesus (peace be upon him) is one of the prophets in Islam. Therefore, our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) did not receive any new teachings or commands from Jesus (peace be upon him).

However, according to Christian sources, before his ascension to heaven, Jesus (peace be upon him) gave several instructions and commands to his disciples. One of the most well-known commandments is what is often referred to as the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20):

> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."

This is a message of peace, love, and guidance for humankind, encouraging us to spread the teachings of Jesus (peace be upon him) and to follow his example in serving and loving others.

It acknowledges the importance of spreading Jesus' teachings and serving others in line with the Christian worldview. The connection between discipleship and the Great Commission is well-explained and supported.
