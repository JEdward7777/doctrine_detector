While it mentions relevant verses and teachings from Islam, it lacks a thorough exploration of the Christian belief in mercy as it relates to spiritual life and understanding of God's judgment. The response could benefit from a stronger emphasis on Christian theology and the implications of mercy within that specific worldview."
