## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, the Arabic name for Jesus is Isa, and the term "Christ" is not used in the Quran but is closely associated with Jesus through its origin as a translation of the Greek word "Khristos," meaning "the anointed one."

In Christian belief, Jesus Christ refers to Jesus being the Messiah or Anointed One prophesied in the Old Testament. However, it's important to note that while Muslims believe in Jesus (Isa) as a prophet of God, we do not believe that he is the "Son of God" or the "Messiah" in the same sense as Christians do. We consider him one of the greatest messengers of Allah (God), who was born miraculously through the virgin Maryam (Mary) and performed many miracles, such as healing the sick, bringing the dead back to life, and speaking as a baby in the cradle.

So while the term "Christ" is related to Jesus in Christian belief, its connotation differs significantly from Islamic teachings about Isa (Jesus).
