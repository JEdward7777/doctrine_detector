  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90/100\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of prayer in Islam and effectively contrasts it with the concept of talking to a false god. The student demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic beliefs and practices. From a Christian perspective, the response could further emphasize the fundamental doctrinal differences between the concept of God in Islam and in Christianity, such as the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus Christ. Overall, it is a well-written answer with a strong focus on doctrinal correctness."
