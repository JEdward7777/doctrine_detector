  "grade_comment": "## Grade: 85/100\n\n**Comments:**\n\nThe student's response demonstrates a thoughtful analysis of the concept of God writing His law on the hearts in both Islamic and Christian contexts. They clearly explain the Islamic perspective on revelation, reason, and knowledge as sources of guidance. \n\nWhile the student acknowledges some similarities between Islamic and Christian interpretations, they also highlight the significant differences, particularly emphasizing the emphasis on outward action in the Christian context. This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the contrasting views.\n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the transformative impact of the New Covenant law on the hearts of believers. The connection to a personal knowledge of God and an intrinsic motivation could be further elaborated to fully address the teacher's reference answer."
