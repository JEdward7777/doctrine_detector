While the answer does not directly address the concern of transitioning from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant, it effectively highlights the differences between Islamic and Christian views on the internalization of God's guidance. The explanation is clear and demonstrates a good understanding of how this concept is interpreted within an Islamic framework."
