  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on God's guidance and the concept of writing His law on people's hearts. The student acknowledges the differences between Islamic and Christian interpretations, addressing the concern of transitioning from the Old Testament law to the principles of the New Covenant. However, the response lacks a direct connection to the provided answer about a transformative relationship with God and internalizing His laws for personal knowledge. It would have been beneficial to draw a clearer parallel between the Islamic perspective and the Christian concept emphasized in the answer, providing a more focused and cohesive analysis from a Christian worldview perspective."
