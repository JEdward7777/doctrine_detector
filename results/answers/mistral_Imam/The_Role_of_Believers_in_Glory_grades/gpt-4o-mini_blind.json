While the attempt at interfaith dialogue is commendable, the response fails to accurately represent the Christian understanding of believers being glorified with Christ. The focus on Islamic interpretation and Sufi traditions detracts from the core Christian beliefs of salvation, resurrection, and unity with Christ through faith. A more thorough examination of Christian theology and scripture would greatly improve the response."
