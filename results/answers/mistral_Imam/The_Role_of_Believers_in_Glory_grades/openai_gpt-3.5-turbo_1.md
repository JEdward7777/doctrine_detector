## [Answer](../The_Role_of_Believers_in_Glory.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the spirit of interfaith dialogue, I would like to provide an understanding based on the interpretation of Islamic scholars and theologians regarding the New Testament passage you mentioned. Please note that this is not a direct quote or teaching from the Quran, but rather an explanation of how some Muslims understand the concept within the Christian context.

The New Testament, in particular the book of Philippians (3:20-21), states, "But our citizenship is in heaven, and we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself."

From an Islamic perspective, Muslims believe that this verse highlights the concept of spiritual transformation rather than physical bodily transformation. In the Sufi tradition, which is the mystical aspect of Islam, the term "glorified with Christ" could be understood as achieving a state of spiritual closeness and unity with God, akin to what Christians believe Christ achieved through his life, death, and resurrection.

It's essential to recognize that Christianity and Islam share fundamental beliefs in the oneness of God (Tawhid) and the importance of good works, faith, and submission to God's will. However, interpretations of specific passages may differ between various Christian denominations and Muslim sects. This interpretation should be considered as one possible understanding within a broader context of interfaith dialogue.

Comment: The response accurately addresses the concern by emphasizing the significance of believers being transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection and sharing in His eternal glory. However, the suggested response also acknowledges the importance of interpreting the passage within an interfaith dialogue context, which may provide a broader perspective on the concept of spiritual transformation. This acknowledgment adds depth to the understanding of the passage and its implications on faith and perseverance.
