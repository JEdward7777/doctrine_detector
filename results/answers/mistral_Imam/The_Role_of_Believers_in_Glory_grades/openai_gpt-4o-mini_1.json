While the effort to engage in interfaith dialogue is commendable, the explanation provided does not directly address the Christian-specific concern regarding the hope and future promise of glory for believers. It falls short in emphasizing the significance of believers being transformed to be like Jesus in their resurrection and sharing in His eternal glory as a source of hope and perseverance in the Christian faith. There is room for improvement in connecting the Islamic interpretation to the Christian concern highlighted."
