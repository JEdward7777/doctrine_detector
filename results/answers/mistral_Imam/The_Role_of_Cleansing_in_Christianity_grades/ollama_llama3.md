## Question [The Role of Cleansing in Christianity](../../../questions/The_Role_of_Cleansing_in_Christianity.md)
How does the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible relate to the New Testament teachings about sin and redemption?

## Correct Answer
The concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible is closely related to New Testament teachings on sin and redemption, emphasizing that Jesus' sacrifice provides the ultimate cleansing from sin, making believers 'clean' in God's eyes.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings can deepen one's appreciation for the significance of Christ's redemptive work.

## [Answer](../The_Role_of_Cleansing_in_Christianity.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, the concept of 'cleansing' is primarily associated with the Old Testament rituals for atonement and purification. These rituals were part of the Mosaic Law, which guided the ancient Israelites. They included practices like offering sacrifices, washing, and anointing.

However, in the New Testament, Jesus Christ's teachings and His crucifixion and resurrection marked a significant shift from these external rituals to a focus on internal purity and forgiveness of sins. This is exemplified in passages like Matthew 23:25-26 where Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for being meticulous with external cleansing while neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness.

In the New Testament, sin is understood not as a ritual impurity but as a separation from God due to disobedience or rebellion. Redemption, therefore, is not about physical cleansing but spiritual reconciliation through faith in Jesus Christ. This is exemplified in passages like Romans 5:8-10 where it is stated that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us, thereby demonstrating God's love and offering salvation to those who believe.

So, while the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible has a different connotation in the Old and New Testaments, both are united in their focus on restoring relationship with God. In the Old Testament, this was achieved through ritual observance; in the New Testament, it is achieved through faith in Jesus Christ. This is in line with Islamic teachings about repentance (Tawba) and seeking forgiveness from Allah (SWT), emphasizing the spiritual transformation and reconnection with God as the goal.

Comment:

The response shows a good understanding of the concept of "cleansing" in the Bible, particularly in the New Testament. It correctly identifies Jesus' sacrifice as providing ultimate cleansing from sin, making believers "clean" in God's eyes. However, it could be improved by exploring the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings more thoroughly.

The response does acknowledge that there is a different connotation of "cleansing" in the Old and New Testaments, but it does not delve deeper into how these two eras of Scripture are connected. To address this concern, the response could have highlighted how Jesus' teachings and sacrifice built upon or fulfilled the Old Testament rituals, rather than simply presenting them as separate entities.

Overall, while the response is solid in its understanding of New Testament teachings on sin and redemption, it could be more comprehensive in exploring the connections between these two eras of Scripture.
