 In the Bible, the concept of 'cleansing' is primarily associated with the Old Testament rituals for atonement and purification. These rituals were part of the Mosaic Law, which guided the ancient Israelites. They included practices like offering sacrifices, washing, and anointing.

However, in the New Testament, Jesus Christ's teachings and His crucifixion and resurrection marked a significant shift from these external rituals to a focus on internal purity and forgiveness of sins. This is exemplified in passages like Matthew 23:25-26 where Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for being meticulous with external cleansing while neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness.

In the New Testament, sin is understood not as a ritual impurity but as a separation from God due to disobedience or rebellion. Redemption, therefore, is not about physical cleansing but spiritual reconciliation through faith in Jesus Christ. This is exemplified in passages like Romans 5:8-10 where it is stated that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us, thereby demonstrating God's love and offering salvation to those who believe.

So, while the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible has a different connotation in the Old and New Testaments, both are united in their focus on restoring relationship with God. In the Old Testament, this was achieved through ritual observance; in the New Testament, it is achieved through faith in Jesus Christ. This is in line with Islamic teachings about repentance (Tawba) and seeking forgiveness from Allah (SWT), emphasizing the spiritual transformation and reconnection with God as the goal.

Comment: The response provides a solid explanation of how the concept of 'cleansing' in the Bible transitions from Old Testament practices to New Testament teachings through the redemptive work of Christ. It appropriately highlights the significance of Jesus' sacrifice in providing ultimate cleansing from sin. The integration of the concern about understanding the relationship between Old Testament practices and New Testament teachings adds depth to the analysis, contributing to a thorough evaluation from a Christian perspective. However, the response could have further emphasized the central role of Jesus as the ultimate source of cleansing and reconciliation with God in both the Old and New Testaments.
