The response appropriately addresses the concern raised and demonstrates a Christian worldview by emphasizing the divine purpose and plans behind God's selection of leaders. However, it could have further highlighted the unique role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate example of a chosen leader in Christianity, and how His leadership impacts the Christian community."
