  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provides a detailed explanation of why the Twelve Apostles were significant among Jesus' disciples from a historical and biblical perspective. However, the response does not address the significance of the Twelve Apostles from a Christian worldview emphasizing their role in spreading the gospel message and establishing the early Christian church. Additionally, the answer's concluding statement regarding Islamic beliefs about Jesus does not directly relate to the question asked. A higher grade could be achieved by incorporating more emphasis on their role in Christian doctrine and the fulfillment of Jesus' ministry."
