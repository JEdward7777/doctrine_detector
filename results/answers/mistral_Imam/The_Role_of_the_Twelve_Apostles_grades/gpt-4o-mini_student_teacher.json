  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation on the significance of the Twelve Apostles from a historical and biblical perspective, covering various aspects such as number symbolism, leadership roles, witnessing the resurrection, and discipleship. However, the answer does not fully address the concern of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. The student's perspective as a Muslim is respected, but the response lacks an analysis or acknowledgment of the Christian specific worldview regarding the apostles' role in the foundation of the early Christian church and the spread of Jesus' teachings."
