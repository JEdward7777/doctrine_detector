 As a Muslim, I don't believe in Jesus (Isa) as a divine being or the Son of God, but rather as one of the great prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity. In this context, my explanation will focus on the significance of the Twelve Apostles from a historical and biblical perspective, not from a religious standpoint.

The Twelve Apostles were significant among Jesus' disciples for several reasons:

1. Number symbolism: The number twelve has symbolic importance in Jewish tradition, as it represents completeness or wholeness. This can be seen in the selection of the Twelve Tribes of Israel and the Twelve Apostles.
2. Leadership roles: After Jesus' ascension to heaven, the Twelve Apostles were given leadership roles within the early Christian community. They played crucial roles in spreading the teachings of Jesus to different regions and establishing churches in various cities.
3. Witnesses to the Resurrection: According to the New Testament, only the Twelve Apostles were witnesses to Jesus' crucifixion, death, and resurrection (Matthew 28:16-20). This made them key figures in early Christian tradition and gave them credibility as messengers of the gospel.
4. Discipleship: The Twelve Apostles were chosen by Jesus to be his closest followers during his ministry on Earth. They accompanied him during his teachings, miracles, and traveled with him throughout Palestine. Their discipleship and devotion to Jesus' mission made them significant in the early Christian movement.

It is important to note that as a Muslim, I believe that the concept of the Trinity (God being three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) is not compatible with Islamic beliefs. Muslims acknowledge Jesus as a messenger of Allah and hold him in high esteem, but we do not accept him as the Son of God or part of a divine Trinity.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a thorough explanation on the significance of the Twelve Apostles from a historical and biblical perspective, covering various aspects such as number symbolism, leadership roles, witnessing the resurrection, and discipleship. However, the answer does not fully address the concern of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. The student's perspective as a Muslim is respected, but the response lacks an analysis or acknowledgment of the Christian specific worldview regarding the apostles' role in the foundation of the early Christian church and the spread of Jesus' teachings.
