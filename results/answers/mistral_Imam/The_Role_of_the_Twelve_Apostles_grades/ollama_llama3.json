  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response does an excellent job of recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, going beyond the minimum requirement by providing four specific reasons why the Twelve Apostles were significant: number symbolism, leadership roles, witnesses to the Resurrection, and discipleship. The author also acknowledges the biblical significance of the apostles' role and provides relevant scriptural references.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't give it a perfect score is that the response doesn't directly address the concern about recognizing the importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry. While the response does discuss their significance, it's not explicitly stated as a central theme. Additionally, some readers may wish for more explicit biblical support or further elaboration on certain points.\n\nComment: Overall, this is a strong response that effectively addresses the concern by providing a detailed explanation of the importance of the Twelve Apostles in Christian belief and ministry. While there are opportunities to improve, the author has demonstrated a clear understanding of the significance of the apostles and their role in spreading Jesus' teachings."
