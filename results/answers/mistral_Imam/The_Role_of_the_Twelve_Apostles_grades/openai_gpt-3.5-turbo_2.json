The response does not fully recognize the theological importance of the apostles in Christian belief and ministry, particularly in terms of their witness to the resurrection and their position as foundational figures in the establishment of the Christian church. Additionally, the response mainly focuses on a historical and symbolic perspective rather than emphasizing the spiritual and doctrinal significance of the apostles in Christian theology."
