However, the justification provided lacks depth and does not fully address the concern raised regarding the significance of the apostles from a Christian perspective. Additionally, the response does not engage with or acknowledge the differences in beliefs between Islam and Christianity, which is crucial in discussing the significance of the Twelve Apostles within a Christian worldview."
