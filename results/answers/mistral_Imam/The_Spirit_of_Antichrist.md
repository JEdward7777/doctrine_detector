## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic teachings, Muslims do not directly refer to the Bible for religious guidance as they believe that the final revealed scripture is the Quran. However, I can share with you some insights on this matter from a comparative perspective, considering that both Islam and Christianity share common roots.

In Christian theology, the spirit of antichrist is often associated with the figure of the Antichrist, who is believed to appear before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ as a deceiver leading people astray from the true faith. The spirit of antichrist is seen as a manifestation or precursor to this figure.

The concept can be found in several books of the Bible, such as 1 John 2:18-26 and 4:3:

1 John 2:18 (New International Version): "Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour."

1 John 4:3 (New International Version): "And every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world."

It's important to note that these passages are interpreted differently within various Christian denominations, and as a Muslim scholar, I would encourage you to consult with religious scholars or leaders in your own community for a more accurate and contextually relevant understanding.

In Islam, the concept of a deceiver or false prophet is present in the Quran but is not directly associated with the spirit of antichrist. Instead, Muslims believe that the Dajjal (Arabic: دجّال) is the Islamic equivalent to the Antichrist figure in Christianity. According to hadiths and some ahadith, the Dajjal will appear towards the end of time, deceive many people, and perform miracles to mislead them. Muslims believe that true faith lies in adhering to the teachings of the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and seeking guidance from God alone.
