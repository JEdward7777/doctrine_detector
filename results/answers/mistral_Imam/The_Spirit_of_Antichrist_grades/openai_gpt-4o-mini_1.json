However, the response did not directly address the concern raised about the importance of recognizing the spirit of antichrist for Christians to stay vigilant against deception. It would have been beneficial to emphasize the significance of discernment and vigilance in identifying deception in light of the spirit of antichrist, aligning more closely with the Christian worldview."
