The comparison to the Islamic concept of \"Al-Qahhar\" might be seen as stretching the similarities between the two faiths, which can potentially confuse or mislead readers. It is crucial to maintain doctrinal clarity and avoid equating concepts from different religious traditions in a way that might compromise Christian beliefs. The explanation on the interchangeability of these titles to emphasize God's might and power is accurate and insightful. Overall, a solid understanding of biblical titles for God is demonstrated, but caution should be exercised when drawing parallels to concepts outside of Christianity."
