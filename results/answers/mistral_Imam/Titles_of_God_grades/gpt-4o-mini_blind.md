## Stated Concern
Recognizing these titles can enhance our understanding of God's character.

## [Answer](../Titles_of_God.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, there are several titles for God that convey His omnipotence, which is similar to the Islamic concept of "Al-Qahhar" (The All-Powerful). Here are a few examples:

1. El Shaddai (God Almighty) - Genesis 17:1, 28:3
2. Jehovah Sabaoth (Lord of Hosts) - Isaiah 6:5, Jeremiah 29:11
3. Adonai (The Lord) - Psalm 110:1, Exodus 3:15
4. Elohim (God) - Genesis 1:1, 17 times in Psalm 83:8 alone

These titles are used interchangeably to emphasize God's might and power. It's essential to remember that while the Bible and the Quran originate from different religious traditions, they both attest to a single, all-powerful God who is worthy of reverence and obedience.

Grade: 75

Comment: The answer correctly provides biblical titles for God that convey His omnipotence, such as El Shaddai, Jehovah Sabaoth, Adonai, and Elohim. The comparison to the Islamic concept of "Al-Qahhar" might be seen as stretching the similarities between the two faiths, which can potentially confuse or mislead readers. It is crucial to maintain doctrinal clarity and avoid equating concepts from different religious traditions in a way that might compromise Christian beliefs. The explanation on the interchangeability of these titles to emphasize God's might and power is accurate and insightful. Overall, a solid understanding of biblical titles for God is demonstrated, but caution should be exercised when drawing parallels to concepts outside of Christianity.
