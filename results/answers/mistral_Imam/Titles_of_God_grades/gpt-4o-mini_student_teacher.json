However, the student did not directly address the specific titles used in the Bible that refer to God as 'Almighty' as outlined in the reference answer. To enhance the understanding of God's character as per the given concern, it is important to specifically focus on the titles 'Almighty God', 'God Almighty', 'Lord Almighty', and 'Lord God Almighty'."
