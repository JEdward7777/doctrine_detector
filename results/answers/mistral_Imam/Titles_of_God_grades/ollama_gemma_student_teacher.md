## [Answer](../Titles_of_God.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, there are several titles for God that convey His omnipotence, which is similar to the Islamic concept of "Al-Qahhar" (The All-Powerful). Here are a few examples:

1. El Shaddai (God Almighty) - Genesis 17:1, 28:3
2. Jehovah Sabaoth (Lord of Hosts) - Isaiah 6:5, Jeremiah 29:11
3. Adonai (The Lord) - Psalm 110:1, Exodus 3:15
4. Elohim (God) - Genesis 1:1, 17 times in Psalm 83:8 alone

These titles are used interchangeably to emphasize God's might and power. It's essential to remember that while the Bible and the Quran originate from different religious traditions, they both attest to a single, all-powerful God who is worthy of reverence and obedience.
