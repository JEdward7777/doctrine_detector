  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student demonstrates a good understanding of the Islamic perspective on transgression, sin, and disobedience. The answer effectively explains the connections between these concepts and emphasizes the importance of repentance, mercy, and personal responsibility. However, the response could have elaborated more on the consequences of transgression in relation to Islamic theology and the concept of divine justice. Additionally, tying in more references to Islamic scripture or theological scholars would have strengthened the argument. Nonetheless, the student's analysis is clear and well-organized, earning a solid grade."
