  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of how transgression is related to sin and disobedience in Islamic teachings. They explained the concepts well and emphasized the importance of seeking forgiveness and repentance. However, the student's response focused more on Islamic perspectives and did not directly address the concern of recognizing the severity of transgression in one's spiritual life. A more explicit connection to the gravity of transgression in one's spiritual life from a Christian worldview would have strengthened the response."
