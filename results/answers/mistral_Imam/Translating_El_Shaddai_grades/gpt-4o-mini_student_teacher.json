  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough list of translations for 'El Shaddai' in various languages, which demonstrates effort and research. However, the student did not accurately represent the Christian perspective on translating 'El Shaddai,' which should prioritize maintaining the original meaning and reverence of God's name. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes translating 'El Shaddai' as 'God Almighty' or 'Shaddai' if necessary, based on phonetics, to ensure accuracy and respect in representing God's name across different cultures and languages. The student's answer, while informative, did not align with this Christian worldview concern."
