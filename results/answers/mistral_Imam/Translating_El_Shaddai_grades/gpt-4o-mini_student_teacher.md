## [Answer](../Translating_El_Shaddai.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we do not refer to figures or concepts that originate from the Judeo-Christian tradition such as 'El Shaddai.' However, for the benefit of understanding this term within a Christian context, I can provide you with its translation into various languages based on local Bible translations:

1. Arabic (Qur'an and Modern Standard Arabic) - El Shaddai does not have an exact equivalent in Arabic as it is a specific Hebrew name for God. In the Qur'an, Allah (God) is addressed using different names and attributes, such as Ar-Rahman (The Most Merciful), Al-Khaliq (The Creator), Al-Aleem (The All-knowing), and more.

2. English - Shaddai can be translated into "Almighty God" or simply "God."

3. Spanish - El Shaddai is "El Shaddai" in Spanish as it derives from the Hebrew language. However, some Bible translations might render this name to "Dios Todopoderoso," which means "All-powerful God."

4. French - El Shaddai can be translated into "El Shaddai" or "Dieu Tout-puissant," which means "Almighty God."

5. German - El Shaddai translates to "El Schaddaj," although some Bible translations might use "Gott Alleinherrscher," meaning "God Almighty."

6. Russian - Бог Всемогущий (Bog Vsemoguschij), which means "God Almighty" is an equivalent translation of El Shaddai in the Russian language.

7. Mandarin Chinese - 全能神 (Quán nèng shén) can be used to translate "El Shaddai," meaning "Almighty God."

8. Japanese - El Shaddai translates to すばらしきことうさま (Subarashiki kotousama), which means "Wonderful and Exalted One" or "God Almighty."

9. Portuguese - Deus Todopoderoso, which means "Almighty God."

Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a thorough list of translations for 'El Shaddai' in various languages, which demonstrates effort and research. However, the student did not accurately represent the Christian perspective on translating 'El Shaddai,' which should prioritize maintaining the original meaning and reverence of God's name. The teacher's reference answer emphasizes translating 'El Shaddai' as 'God Almighty' or 'Shaddai' if necessary, based on phonetics, to ensure accuracy and respect in representing God's name across different cultures and languages. The student's answer, while informative, did not align with this Christian worldview concern.
