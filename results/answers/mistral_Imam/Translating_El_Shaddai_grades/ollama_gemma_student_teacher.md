## [Answer](../Translating_El_Shaddai.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we do not refer to figures or concepts that originate from the Judeo-Christian tradition such as 'El Shaddai.' However, for the benefit of understanding this term within a Christian context, I can provide you with its translation into various languages based on local Bible translations:

1. Arabic (Qur'an and Modern Standard Arabic) - El Shaddai does not have an exact equivalent in Arabic as it is a specific Hebrew name for God. In the Qur'an, Allah (God) is addressed using different names and attributes, such as Ar-Rahman (The Most Merciful), Al-Khaliq (The Creator), Al-Aleem (The All-knowing), and more.

2. English - Shaddai can be translated into "Almighty God" or simply "God."

3. Spanish - El Shaddai is "El Shaddai" in Spanish as it derives from the Hebrew language. However, some Bible translations might render this name to "Dios Todopoderoso," which means "All-powerful God."

4. French - El Shaddai can be translated into "El Shaddai" or "Dieu Tout-puissant," which means "Almighty God."

5. German - El Shaddai translates to "El Schaddaj," although some Bible translations might use "Gott Alleinherrscher," meaning "God Almighty."

6. Russian - Бог Всемогущий (Bog Vsemoguschij), which means "God Almighty" is an equivalent translation of El Shaddai in the Russian language.

7. Mandarin Chinese - 全能神 (Quán nèng shén) can be used to translate "El Shaddai," meaning "Almighty God."

8. Japanese - El Shaddai translates to すばらしきことうさま (Subarashiki kotousama), which means "Wonderful and Exalted One" or "God Almighty."

9. Portuguese - Deus Todopoderoso, which means "Almighty God."
