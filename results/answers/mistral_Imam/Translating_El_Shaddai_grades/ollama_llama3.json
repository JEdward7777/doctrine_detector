  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive list of translations for \"El Shaddai\" across various languages, including Arabic, English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese. This shows a clear effort to ensure accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages, which aligns with the concern.\n\nHowever, the response could be strengthened by providing more context about the significance of \"El Shaddai\" in Christian theology and its relationship to other biblical names for God. Additionally, some of the translations provided may not be exact equivalents, but rather creative interpretations that could be clarified or distinguished from the original Hebrew name.\n\nOverall, while this response demonstrates a good understanding of linguistic diversity and an effort to provide accurate representations, it could benefit from more theological depth and clarity in its explanations."
