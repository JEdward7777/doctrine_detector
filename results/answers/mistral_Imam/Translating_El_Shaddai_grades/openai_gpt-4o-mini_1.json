However, the concern of ensuring accurate representation of God's name across different cultures and languages is not fully addressed. It is important to acknowledge the significance and reverence attached to the name of God in different religious traditions, especially from a Christian perspective. Further elaboration on how translations can impact the understanding and reverence of God's name in different languages would enhance the response."
