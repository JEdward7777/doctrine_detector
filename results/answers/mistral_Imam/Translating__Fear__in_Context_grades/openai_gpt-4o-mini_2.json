The connection between fear as deep respect, reverence, or awe of God is well articulated. However, the concern addresses the potential misinterpretation of 'fear' and its implications on one's faith and spiritual life, could have been further emphasized by explicitly discussing how a distorted view of God may impact one's relationship with Him."
