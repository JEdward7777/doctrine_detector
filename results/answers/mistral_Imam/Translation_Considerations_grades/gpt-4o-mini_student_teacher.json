  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well thought out and detailed response addressing the importance of retaining terms like 'Zion' and 'Daughter' in translations of Biblical texts based on literary context, historical accuracy, cultural sensitivity, and respect for the source text. The answer demonstrates a good understanding of the significance of these terms in conveying the original spiritual and cultural meaning. However, the student's answer could have been strengthened by focusing more explicitly on the rich figurative meanings and the connection to Biblical heritage and teachings, as highlighted in the reference answer from the teacher."
