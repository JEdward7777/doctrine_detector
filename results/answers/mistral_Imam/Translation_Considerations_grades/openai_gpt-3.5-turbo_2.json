The response effectively emphasizes the spiritual and cultural significance of these terms in the context of translating Biblical texts into Arabic. It appropriately considers the importance of maintaining the original meanings and cultural nuances to accurately convey the depth of the text's message. The reasoning provided aligns well with a Christian worldview that values the preservation of the original intent and significance of sacred texts. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the concern and effectively applies a Christian-specific perspective."
