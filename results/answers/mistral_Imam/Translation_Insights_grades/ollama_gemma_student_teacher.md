## Question [Translation Insights](../../../questions/Translation_Insights.md)
What are some suggested translations for the phrase 'image of God' when applied to humans and Jesus, and why might these translations be significant?

## Correct Answer
For humans, suggested translations include 'created to be like him' or 'with characteristics like his own'; for Jesus, 'exact likeness of God' or 'same essence as God'. These translations underscore the nature of humanity's relation to God and Christ's divine nature.

## Stated Concern
This question encourages exploration of the implications of translation in understanding biblical teachings.

## [Answer](../Translation_Insights.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, humans are considered as "Vicegerents of Allah" (Khalifah) or "Servants of Allah" (Abd). The concept of human being the "image of God" is not directly translated in the Quran. However, some scholars suggest translating it as a reflection or manifestation of Allah's attributes within creation.

As for Jesus (peace be upon him), Muslims believe he was a messenger of Allah and a human being, not divine. In Islamic tradition, Jesus is considered to have been a miracle born without a father, but not God incarnate or the image of God in a literal sense. Some suggest translating it as a unique manifestation of Allah's mercy and wisdom through him, reflecting Allah's attributes in his life, teachings, and miracles.

These translations are significant because they help uphold the Islamic belief in Tawhid (Oneness of Allah), emphasizing that God is one, unique, and without any partners or equals. Additionally, it highlights the importance of recognizing all creation as a manifestation of Allah's attributes and His divine will. This understanding can foster humility, respect for all of Allah's creations, and an increased awareness of our role as stewards of this world.
