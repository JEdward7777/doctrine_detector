The response effectively explains the Islamic understanding while drawing parallels to the Christian belief in the divine nature of Jesus. However, the response does not directly address the specific translations suggested in the given answer or elaborate on how those translations impact the understanding of biblical teachings. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the theological differences between the two perspectives could enhance the response."
