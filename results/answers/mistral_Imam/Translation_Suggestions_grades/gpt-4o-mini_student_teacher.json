  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided well-thought-out alternative translations rooted in Islamic terminology, which can be enriching for interfaith dialogue and understanding.

To improve the grade, the student should focus on providing translations that specifically align with Christian beliefs and values to meet the given concern."
