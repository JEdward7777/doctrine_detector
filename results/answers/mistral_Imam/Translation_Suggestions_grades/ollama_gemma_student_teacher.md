## [Answer](../Translation_Suggestions.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic terminology, the Arabic word most closely related to the biblical concept of "zeal" is "shuju'ah" (شُجوع), which means "ardor," "zeal," or "passion." However, in a more spiritual context, it can also mean being zealous for Allah (swt) and His teachings.

For those who prefer to use translations based on the Quran and Hadiths, here are some alternative phrases that convey the essence of being zealous while still rooted in Islamic language:

1. "Fervently devoted" - This term reflects the Muslim's strong attachment and dedication to Allah (swt) and His teachings.
2. "Eagerly diligent" or "Diligently eager" - A believer who is keen on learning and following Islamic teachings can be described as having this quality.
3. "Enthusiastically pious" - This phrase emphasizes the passion and excitement a Muslim feels while striving to adhere to Islamic values and practices.
4. "Keenly devout" or "Devoutly keen" - This describes a person who is deeply committed to their faith, always eager to learn more about Islam and live according to its teachings.
5. "Ardently steadfast" - This term highlights the determination and perseverance shown by Muslims in upholding their faith and adhering to Islamic principles.
6. "Fervent in faith" or "Strong in faith" - A person who is zealous for Islam demonstrates a deep and passionate commitment to their religion, which can be expressed as being fervent or strong in faith.
