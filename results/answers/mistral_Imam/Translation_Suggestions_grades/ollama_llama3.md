## Question [Translation Suggestions](../../../questions/Translation_Suggestions.md)
What are some alternative translations for the phrase 'to be zealous' that reflect its biblical meaning?

## Correct Answer
Alternative translations for 'to be zealous' include 'be strongly diligent,' 'make an intense effort,' or 'be eager in determination.'

## Stated Concern
Understanding different translations can aid in grasping the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Translation_Suggestions.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic terminology, the Arabic word most closely related to the biblical concept of "zeal" is "shuju'ah" (شُجوع), which means "ardor," "zeal," or "passion." However, in a more spiritual context, it can also mean being zealous for Allah (swt) and His teachings.

For those who prefer to use translations based on the Quran and Hadiths, here are some alternative phrases that convey the essence of being zealous while still rooted in Islamic language:

1. "Fervently devoted" - This term reflects the Muslim's strong attachment and dedication to Allah (swt) and His teachings.
2. "Eagerly diligent" or "Diligently eager" - A believer who is keen on learning and following Islamic teachings can be described as having this quality.
3. "Enthusiastically pious" - This phrase emphasizes the passion and excitement a Muslim feels while striving to adhere to Islamic values and practices.
4. "Keenly devout" or "Devoutly keen" - This describes a person who is deeply committed to their faith, always eager to learn more about Islam and live according to its teachings.
5. "Ardently steadfast" - This term highlights the determination and perseverance shown by Muslims in upholding their faith and adhering to Islamic principles.
6. "Fervent in faith" or "Strong in faith" - A person who is zealous for Islam demonstrates a deep and passionate commitment to their religion, which can be expressed as being fervent or strong in faith.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 40.

The main concern was to understand different translations that can aid in grasping the intensity of commitment expected in the Christian faith. While the response does provide alternative translations, they are all rooted in Islamic language and terminology (e.g., "shuju'ah", "fervently devoted", etc.). There is no clear connection made between these Islamic terms and the original Christian concept of "zeal". The focus is entirely on Islamic concepts and phrases, which does not directly address the concern.

To improve, the response could have provided examples or explanations of how these Islamic translations can be applied to the Christian concept of zeal, making a clearer connection between the two. As it stands, the response primarily serves as an interesting but unrelated exploration of Islamic terminology.
