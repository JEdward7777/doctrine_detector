2. Divine Loyalty: This term emphasizes the unwavering loyalty and commitment that Muslims are expected to demonstrate towards Allah in return for His countless blessings and mercies. The concept of covenant (al-'ahd) also signifies this divine loyalty, so 'covenant faithfulness' can be translated as 'Divine Loyalty'.

3. Steadfast Trustworthiness: This term highlights the aspect of reliance and dependability that Muslims are encouraged to have on Allah, as well as their commitment to fulfill their promises in return for His endless mercy. The idea of covenant (al-'ahd) includes this element of steadfast trustworthiness, thus making it a suitable alternative translation for 'covenant faithfulness'.

4. Pious Sincerity: This term underscores the religious commitment and sincerity that Muslims are expected to maintain in their relationships with Allah and fellow believers. The concept of covenant (al-'ahd) involves this aspect of piety, which makes 'pious sincerity' another possible alternative translation for 'covenant faithfulness'.
