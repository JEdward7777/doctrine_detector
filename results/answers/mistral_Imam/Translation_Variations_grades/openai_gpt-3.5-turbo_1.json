While these translations convey important aspects of the original term, they do not directly address the concern of exploring different interpretations of biblical terms. The response could be enhanced by further incorporating specific biblical references or principles to deepen the comparison and understanding between Christian and Islamic perspectives on covenant faithfulness."
