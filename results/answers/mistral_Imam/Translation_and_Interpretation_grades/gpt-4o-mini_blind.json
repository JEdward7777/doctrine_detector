The explanation of how different terms are used in reference to God versus ordinary people is clear and accurate. However, in a Christian-specific worldview, it would have been beneficial for the student to include a comparison with the Christian usage of \"Lord\" to further differentiate the nuances between the two religions' perspectives on the term. This added comparison would have enhanced the depth and analysis of the response from a Christian doctrinal standpoint."
