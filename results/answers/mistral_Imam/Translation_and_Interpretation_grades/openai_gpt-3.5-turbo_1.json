It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting the importance of maintaining the distinction in religious and cultural contexts. However, while the explanation is informative and well-written, there could be a more direct application to how proper translation and interpretation of biblical terms impact the understanding of scripture and the nature of God from a Christian worldview standpoint."
