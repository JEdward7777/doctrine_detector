  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provided a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"abomination\" in both biblical and Quranic contexts, considering the importance of accurate translation for understanding texts and actions against God's laws. The comparison between the terms in Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic was well-done and demonstrated a respectful understanding of religious terms in different traditions. The response could have further delved into specific examples of 'abomination' in both texts to provide a deeper analysis. Overall, a solid and informative response."
