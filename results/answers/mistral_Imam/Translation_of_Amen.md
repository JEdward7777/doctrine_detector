## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Arabic, the concept of 'truly' or 'verily' is conveyed through several words depending on the context. Here are a few possibilities for the phrase "truly I tell you" as it appears in the Gospels:

1. "Inna" (إنّا): This word can be used to emphasize the truth and certainty of what follows. It's often translated as "verily," "indeed," or "truly." For example, in Matthew 5:20, Jesus says, "For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." Here, a possible translation would be "Inna la-kum, in case your righteousness does not surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

2. "Qad" (قَد): This word is used to express a completed action or something that is certain to happen. It can also be translated as 'verily,' 'truly,' or 'indeed.' For example, in Matthew 16:18, Jesus says, "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church." Here, a possible translation would be "Qad anta Petrus, wa-'ala hadha as-sakhron mubaninu 'asharat abnaa isra'il as-sakhena."

3. "Enni" (أني): This word is used to express a personal or emphatic 'I.' It can also be translated as 'verily,' 'truly,' or 'indeed.' For example, in Matthew 17:1, it says, "And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves." Here, a possible translation would be "Enni wa-ba'da alf fawq 'asharat yawmini khalaqtubi 'isa 'abdallah ilahi ibn maryam bil-mawsim al-hadithi khalfa peter ya'qub wa-ya'qub isra'il, wa-rajaytuhum 'ala jebelun thariqan a'la dhatihim."

These translations are approximate and may vary depending on the specific context in which they are used. It's essential to remember that these translations are not meant to replace the original Arabic but rather to provide an understanding of the meaning within a Muslim context.
