  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of potential translations of 'truly' in Arabic within a Muslim context, which shows effort and research. However, the answer lacks clarity in connecting the translations to Jesus' usage in the Gospels and does not directly address the question about Jesus' specific usage of \"truly I tell you.\" Additionally, the response focuses more on the Arabic language and less on the Christian perspective or theological implications of Jesus' use of the term. A higher grade could be achieved by addressing the doctrinal significance and theological implications of Jesus' use of \"truly\" in a Christian context."
