  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides an insightful exploration of potential Arabic translations for the phrase \"truly I tell you\" as used in the Gospels, there are a few concerns from a Christian worldview perspective:\n\n1. The student's translations heavily lean towards maintaining accuracy within a Muslim context, which may not fully align with the Christian understanding of Jesus' teachings as recorded in the Gospels.\n\n2. The translations provided by the student, while technically accurate from an Arabic language perspective, may not capture the full depth of meaning and authority conveyed by Jesus when using the phrase \"truly I tell you.\"\n\n3. The student's focus on linguistic accuracy overlooks the importance of capturing the spiritual and theological nuances inherent in Jesus' words, which play a crucial role in accurate biblical translation and interpretation.\n\nOverall, while the student's language expertise is evident, there is a need for a deeper exploration of the theological implications and significance of accurately translating phrases attributed to Jesus in the Gospels within the specific Christian context."
