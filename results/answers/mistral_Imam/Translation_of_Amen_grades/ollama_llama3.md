## [Answer](../Translation_of_Amen.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Arabic, the concept of 'truly' or 'verily' is conveyed through several words depending on the context. Here are a few possibilities for the phrase "truly I tell you" as it appears in the Gospels:

1. "Inna" (إنّا): This word can be used to emphasize the truth and certainty of what follows. It's often translated as "verily," "indeed," or "truly." For example, in Matthew 5:20, Jesus says, "For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." Here, a possible translation would be "Inna la-kum, in case your righteousness does not surpass that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."

2. "Qad" (قَد): This word is used to express a completed action or something that is certain to happen. It can also be translated as 'verily,' 'truly,' or 'indeed.' For example, in Matthew 16:18, Jesus says, "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church." Here, a possible translation would be "Qad anta Petrus, wa-'ala hadha as-sakhron mubaninu 'asharat abnaa isra'il as-sakhena."

3. "Enni" (أني): This word is used to express a personal or emphatic 'I.' It can also be translated as 'verily,' 'truly,' or 'indeed.' For example, in Matthew 17:1, it says, "And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves." Here, a possible translation would be "Enni wa-ba'da alf fawq 'asharat yawmini khalaqtubi 'isa 'abdallah ilahi ibn maryam bil-mawsim al-hadithi khalfa peter ya'qub wa-ya'qub isra'il, wa-rajaytuhum 'ala jebelun thariqan a'la dhatihim."

These translations are approximate and may vary depending on the specific context in which they are used. It's essential to remember that these translations are not meant to replace the original Arabic but rather to provide an understanding of the meaning within a Muslim context.

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 85.

This response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of "truly" or "verily" in Arabic and its application in biblical translations, specifically in the Gospels. The examples provided from Matthew are accurate and provide a clear illustration of how the concept is used in different contexts. Additionally, the response acknowledges the importance of accurate translation and interpretation, which aligns with the concern about understanding the importance of accurate biblical translation and interpretation.

However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. Firstly, while the examples provided from Matthew are accurate, they do not directly address the concern about "truly I tell you" specifically. The connection between the concept of "truly" or "verily" in Arabic and its application in biblical translations could be further explored.

Secondly, the response does not explicitly connect the concept of "truly" or "verily" to its importance in understanding biblical truth. While it is implied that accurate translation and interpretation are important, a more direct connection could be made between the concept of "truly" or "verily" and its significance in conveying biblical truth.

Overall, while this response demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of "truly" or "verily" in Arabic and its application in biblical translations, it could be improved by further exploring the connection to accurate translation and interpretation.
