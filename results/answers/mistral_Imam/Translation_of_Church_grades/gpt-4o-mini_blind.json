However, the focus should be on providing translations that reflect the meaning of 'church' accurately within a Christian context. The provided translations do not directly convey the concept of a Christian place of worship. Additionally, the information could be presented more clearly and concisely. A stronger emphasis on the doctrinal significance of the term 'church' and its spiritual significance within Christianity would have improved the response."
