  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided translations of the term 'church' in various languages, which shows effort in exploring linguistic diversity. However, the response did not address the concern of accurately representing the inclusive nature of the church in translations. The reference answer emphasizes the importance of translating the term in a way that encompasses all believers, not just a specific group. The student's answer did not align with this concern and therefore falls short in addressing the specific aspect highlighted."
