However, the student missed addressing the concern about maintaining the accurate meaning of \"Lord Yahweh\" specifically, as suggested in the reference answer. The student should have focused more on the significance of the terms \"Lord God\" or \"God who is the Lord\" for maintaining the theological implications and reverence associated with the term \"Yahweh.\""
