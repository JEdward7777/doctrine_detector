  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student gave a well-researched explanation of the concepts of Hades and Sheol within Christian and Jewish theology and provided suitable translations that respect their biblical meanings. However, the response could be improved by directly addressing the concern of ensuring accurate biblical representation in translations for greater understanding among believers. The student should have included more emphasis on the importance of maintaining the original biblical context in translations to aid believers in comprehending the significance of these terms."
