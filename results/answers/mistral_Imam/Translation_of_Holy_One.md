However, it can be translated or approximated as follows:

1. English: The Lord, God, or The Almighty
2. Spanish: Dios (God) or El Senor (The Lord)
3. French: Dieu (God) or Seigneur (The Lord)
4. German: Gott (God) oder Herr (The Lord)
5. Italian: Dio (God) or Signore (The Lord)
6. Portuguese: Deus (God) or Senhor (The Lord)
7. Chinese: 上帝 (Shàngdì, The Almighty) or 神 (Shén, The Divine)
8. Japanese: 神様 (Kami-sama, The God) or 上 position (Ue no kami, The Highest Deity)
9. Russian: Бог (Bog, God) or Господь (Gospod', The Lord)
10. Turkish: Allah (The same as in Arabic, since it is borrowed from the Arabic language and not translated)
11. Urdu: Allah (The same as in Arabic, since it is borrowed from the Arabic language and not translated)
