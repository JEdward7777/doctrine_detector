  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for the term \"Holy One\" in various languages, which shows effort and research. However, the student focused more on the term \"Allah\" in Islamic terminology rather than directly addressing the term \"Holy One\" in a Christian context. The reference answer emphasizes retaining the meaning of holiness, which the student did not fully address. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on the theological implications and the concept of holiness when translating the term \"Holy One\" in different languages from a Christian worldview."
