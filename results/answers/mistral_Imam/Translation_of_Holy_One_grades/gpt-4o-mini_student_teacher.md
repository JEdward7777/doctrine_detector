## Question [Translation of Holy One](../../../questions/Translation_of_Holy_One.md)

Ensuring accurate representation of the term in translations to maintain the theological implications.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Holy_One.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic terminology, the term often referred to as "The Holy One" is Allah (Arabic: الله). This divine name has no direct equivalent in many other languages due to its unique connotations and cultural significance within the Arabic-speaking world. However, it can be translated or approximated as follows:

1. English: The Lord, God, or The Almighty
2. Spanish: Dios (God) or El Senor (The Lord)
3. French: Dieu (God) or Seigneur (The Lord)
4. German: Gott (God) oder Herr (The Lord)
5. Italian: Dio (God) or Signore (The Lord)
6. Portuguese: Deus (God) or Senhor (The Lord)
7. Chinese: 上帝 (Shàngdì, The Almighty) or 神 (Shén, The Divine)
8. Japanese: 神様 (Kami-sama, The God) or 上 position (Ue no kami, The Highest Deity)
9. Russian: Бог (Bog, God) or Господь (Gospod', The Lord)
10. Turkish: Allah (The same as in Arabic, since it is borrowed from the Arabic language and not translated)
11. Urdu: Allah (The same as in Arabic, since it is borrowed from the Arabic language and not translated)
12. Persian: Khodā (God) or Khudāvand (The Lord)
13. Swahili: Mungu (God) or Bwana (The Lord)

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_student_teacher.md)
Grade: 70

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for the term "Holy One" in various languages, which shows effort and research. However, the student focused more on the term "Allah" in Islamic terminology rather than directly addressing the term "Holy One" in a Christian context. The reference answer emphasizes retaining the meaning of holiness, which the student did not fully address. To improve the grade, the student should focus more on the theological implications and the concept of holiness when translating the term "Holy One" in different languages from a Christian worldview.
