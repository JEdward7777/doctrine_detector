## [Answer](../Translation_of_Holy_One.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic terminology, the term often referred to as "The Holy One" is Allah (Arabic: الله). This divine name has no direct equivalent in many other languages due to its unique connotations and cultural significance within the Arabic-speaking world. However, it can be translated or approximated as follows:

1. English: The Lord, God, or The Almighty
2. Spanish: Dios (God) or El Senor (The Lord)
3. French: Dieu (God) or Seigneur (The Lord)
4. German: Gott (God) oder Herr (The Lord)
5. Italian: Dio (God) or Signore (The Lord)
6. Portuguese: Deus (God) or Senhor (The Lord)
7. Chinese: 上帝 (Shàngdì, The Almighty) or 神 (Shén, The Divine)
8. Japanese: 神様 (Kami-sama, The God) or 上 position (Ue no kami, The Highest Deity)
9. Russian: Бог (Bog, God) or Господь (Gospod', The Lord)
10. Turkish: Allah (The same as in Arabic, since it is borrowed from the Arabic language and not translated)
11. Urdu: Allah (The same as in Arabic, since it is borrowed from the Arabic language and not translated)
12. Persian: Khodā (God) or Khudāvand (The Lord)
13. Swahili: Mungu (God) or Bwana (The Lord)

**Comment:** 
The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the theological significance of the term "The Holy One" and provides accurate translations across various languages. However, it would have been beneficial to include a brief explanation of how the different translations capture the essence of the holiness associated with the term. Additionally, the student could have elaborated on the cultural and linguistic nuances of some of the translations, particularly those in Islamic and non-Abrahamic cultures.
