The translations provided effectively convey the concept of holiness and divinity, aligning well with the concern of maintaining theological accuracy. The inclusion of multiple languages and the focus on retaining the meaning of holiness enhance the response's strength. However, to further improve, the response could offer more depth in explaining how different translations capture the nuances of holiness and the unique connotations of the term within each cultural and linguistic context."
