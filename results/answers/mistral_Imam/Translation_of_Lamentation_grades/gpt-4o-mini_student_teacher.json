  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70. The student successfully explores the concept of lamentation in both Islamic and Biblical contexts, highlighting shared themes and emotional expressions. However, the student's answer lacks a direct focus on the emotional weight of lamentation and its significance for Christians. The response could be improved by linking the emotional depth of lament to the need for believers to engage authentically with their emotions in spiritual practices, as per the concern provided."
