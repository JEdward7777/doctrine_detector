  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer as 60.\n\nWhile the student provides relevant information about Islamic terminology related to predestination, the response does not directly address the concern of ensuring accurate understanding of biblical translations. The student's answer focuses on Islamic perspectives and terminology, rather than suggesting translations specifically related to the term 'predestined' in a Biblical context. If the question was about translations in general, the response would be much stronger. \n\nTherefore, a grade of 60 is given to reflect the partial relevance of the answer to the concern. It is important for the student to align their responses more closely with the specific context and question provided."
