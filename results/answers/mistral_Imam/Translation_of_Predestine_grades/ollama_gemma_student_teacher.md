## [Answer](../Translation_of_Predestine.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic terminology, the concept of predestined is often referred to using terms such as:

1. Qadar (قدر): This is an Arabic word that signifies God's preordainment or divine decree. It encompasses both positive and negative events in our lives, as well as our actions and decisions. However, it does not imply determinism or fatalism but rather emphasizes the sovereignty of Allah (God) over all affairs.

2. Adl (عدل): This term means justice, fairness, and equity. It is used to explain that whatever God has decreed for us is just and righteous, even if we may not understand its wisdom in our human perspective.

3. Qada wa Qadar (قداء وقدرة): This phrase refers specifically to God's power to create, preserve, and ordain all things according to His will. It highlights the idea that everything that happens has been predestined by Allah, but humans still have free will within those predetermined boundaries.

4. Tawakkul (توكل): This word translates to trust or reliance. It encourages Muslims to put their faith in God and accept whatever He decrees for them, knowing that it is ultimately for the greater good and in accordance with His infinite wisdom.
