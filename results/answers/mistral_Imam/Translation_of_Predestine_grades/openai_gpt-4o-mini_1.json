  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The response provides a detailed explanation of Islamic terminology related to predestination, which is informative. However, it does not directly address the concern regarding accurate understanding of biblical translations related to predestination. To improve the grade, the response should have included a comparison or contrast with Christian perspectives on predestination as derived from biblical translations."
