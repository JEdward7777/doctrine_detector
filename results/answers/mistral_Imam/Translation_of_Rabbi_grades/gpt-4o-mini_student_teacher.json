  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of considerations for translating the term \"Rabbi\" into various languages, demonstrating cultural sensitivity and linguistic accuracy. However, the response did not directly address the concern of ensuring accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith. From a Christian worldview, it is crucial to uphold the significance of Jesus as more than just a teacher, and the emphasis on this theological aspect was lacking in the student's answer. Further integration of Jesus' unique role in teaching within Christianity would have strengthened the response."
