  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a deep understanding of the complexities involved in translating the term \"Rabbi\" across cultures and religions. The inclusion of considerations such as cultural sensitivity, linguistic accuracy, religious appropriateness, contextual clarity, and translation consistency is commendable. Additionally, the student acknowledges the need for collaboration with experts in both Judaism and the target language for an accurate and respectful representation. While the response is comprehensive, it could benefit from further elaboration on how the specific concerns of Christian faith and Jesus' role in teaching can be addressed in the translation process."
