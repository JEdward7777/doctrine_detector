  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive and well-thought-out approach to translating the term \"Rabbi\" while respecting the significance of the title in Judaism and considering the cultural and linguistic nuances in various contexts. The considerations outlined demonstrate a strong awareness of the importance of accurately representing religious titles and roles in translations. However, there could be a stronger emphasis on the unique and central role of Jesus as a teacher within the Christian faith, ensuring that the translation does not inadvertently diminish His divinity or importance. Overall, the response effectively addresses the concern while offering valuable insights for translation work."
