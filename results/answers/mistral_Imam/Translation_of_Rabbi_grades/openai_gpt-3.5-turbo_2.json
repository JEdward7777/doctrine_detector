The concern about accurately representing Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith is appropriately addressed by emphasizing the significance of the title and ensuring it aligns with the reverence given to Jesus as more than just a schoolteacher. The response could further enhance its evaluation by explicitly mentioning the need to convey Jesus' divine authority and role as the Messiah within the translation."
