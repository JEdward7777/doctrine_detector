The concern about ensuring an accurate representation of Jesus' role in teaching within the Christian faith is also addressed. However, the response could have strengthened its Christian-specific perspective by specifically referencing Jesus as the ultimate Rabbi or teacher within Christianity and emphasizing the unique theological significance of His teaching role."
