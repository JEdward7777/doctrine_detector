However, the focus should have been on how the term 'ransom' is understood within a Christian theological framework rather than solely within an Islamic context. Additionally, the translations provided in other languages may not fully capture the theological nuances of the concept of ransom as understood within Christian doctrine, which would have been valuable to include for a more comprehensive answer."
