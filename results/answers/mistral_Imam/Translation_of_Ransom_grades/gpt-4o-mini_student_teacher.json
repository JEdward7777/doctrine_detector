However, there is a key concern regarding theological accuracy and understanding across different cultural contexts. The provided translations focus more on financial compensation or expiation rather than the Christian theological concept of ransom, which entails a specific theological meaning related to redemption through the payment of a price. The translations provided do not capture this theological nuance accurately. It would be beneficial for the student to deepen their understanding of the theological implications of the term 'ransom' in different languages from a Christian worldview perspective."
