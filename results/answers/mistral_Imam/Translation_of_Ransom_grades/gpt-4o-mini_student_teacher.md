 In Islamic terminology, the term 'ransom' (Arabic: فيضah, Fidyah) is used to refer to a monetary compensation paid by a person who has the means but is unable to perform a mandatory religious act (like fasting during Ramadan or Hajj pilgrimage), due to illness, old age, travel, menstruation, or other valid reasons. The purpose of Fidyah is to alleviate the sinner's guilt and help those in need.

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations for the term 'ransom' in various languages, showcasing a good effort in considering linguistic diversity. However, there is a key concern regarding theological accuracy and understanding across different cultural contexts. The provided translations focus more on financial compensation or expiation rather than the Christian theological concept of ransom, which entails a specific theological meaning related to redemption through the payment of a price. The translations provided do not capture this theological nuance accurately. It would be beneficial for the student to deepen their understanding of the theological implications of the term 'ransom' in different languages from a Christian worldview perspective.
