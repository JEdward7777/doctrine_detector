The concern is to ensure that theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. However, the response's definition of \"ransom\" as \"pay to release,\" \"buy back,\" or \"penalty paid\" does not fully capture the Islamic understanding of Fidyah as a monetary compensation for missing mandatory religious acts due to valid reasons. The response also does not demonstrate an awareness of the theological significance and purpose of Fidyah in alleviating guilt and helping those in need."
