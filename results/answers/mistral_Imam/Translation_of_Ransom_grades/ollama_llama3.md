## [Answer](../Translation_of_Ransom.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic terminology, the term 'ransom' (Arabic: فيضah, Fidyah) is used to refer to a monetary compensation paid by a person who has the means but is unable to perform a mandatory religious act (like fasting during Ramadan or Hajj pilgrimage), due to illness, old age, travel, menstruation, or other valid reasons. The purpose of Fidyah is to alleviate the sinner's guilt and help those in need.

Here are translations of Fidyah (ransom) in various languages:

1. English: Compensation, expiation, atonement, redemption money, or contribution.
2. Spanish: Compensación, expiación, compensación de pecado, dinero de redención, o contribución.
3. French: Rachat, expiration, expiation, rançon, ou contribution.
4. German: Erlösungsgeld, Entschädigung, Aussonderungsgeld, Lösegeld, oder Beitrag.
5. Italian: Redenzione, espiazione, compensazione, denaro di redenzione, o contributo.
6. Russian: Искупительный взнос, компенсация, штраф, выкуп или пожертвование.
7. Chinese: 赎金, 补偿金, 豁免金, 救赎金, 或者献出。
8. Arabic (other than Modern Standard Arabic): Fidyah, Fidya, Fada'at, or Fidha.
9. Turkish: Kazanç, Koruma, Sözleşme Para, Kardeslik Vergisi, Yağın Para.
10. Persian: فیضه, تعويض, اقساط, دمارگاه، یا محصول.

Comment: While the response provides a thorough list of translations for the term "Fidyah" in various languages, it falls short in accurately conveying the theological concept of ransom. The concern is to ensure that theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. However, the response's definition of "ransom" as "pay to release," "buy back," or "penalty paid" does not fully capture the Islamic understanding of Fidyah as a monetary compensation for missing mandatory religious acts due to valid reasons. The response also does not demonstrate an awareness of the theological significance and purpose of Fidyah in alleviating guilt and helping those in need.
