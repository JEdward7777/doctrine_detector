  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provided a thorough explanation of the term 'ransom' in Islamic terminology and offered translations in various languages, aligning well with the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. However, a Christian-specific worldview was not applied in the grading process, which could have deepened the analysis and evaluation of the response."
