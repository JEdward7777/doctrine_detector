The additional information on the meanings of 'ransom' as 'pay to release,' 'buy back,' or 'penalty paid' adds depth to the understanding of the concept. However, the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts could have been addressed more directly by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the original theological significance of the term 'ransom' in different languages. Overall, a good response but could have been strengthened by further emphasizing the theological implications in various translations."
