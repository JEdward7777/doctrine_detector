 In Islamic terminology, the term 'ransom' (Arabic: فيضah, Fidyah) is used to refer to a monetary compensation paid by a person who has the means but is unable to perform a mandatory religious act (like fasting during Ramadan or Hajj pilgrimage), due to illness, old age, travel, menstruation, or other valid reasons. The purpose of Fidyah is to alleviate the sinner's guilt and help those in need.

The additional information on the meanings of 'ransom' as 'pay to release,' 'buy back,' or 'penalty paid' adds depth to the understanding of the concept. However, the concern of ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts could have been addressed more directly by emphasizing the importance of maintaining the original theological significance of the term 'ransom' in different languages.
