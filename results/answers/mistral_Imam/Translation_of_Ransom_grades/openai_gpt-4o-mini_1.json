However, the concern is specifically focused on ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. While the response does provide translations, it lacks a deeper analysis or comparison of how the term may be interpreted or applied differently within different languages and cultures, which could enhance the evaluation in this context."
