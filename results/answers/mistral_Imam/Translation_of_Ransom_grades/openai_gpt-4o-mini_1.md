 In Islamic terminology, the term 'ransom' (Arabic: فيضah, Fidyah) is used to refer to a monetary compensation paid by a person who has the means but is unable to perform a mandatory religious act (like fasting during Ramadan or Hajj pilgrimage), due to illness, old age, travel, menstruation, or other valid reasons. The purpose of Fidyah is to alleviate the sinner's guilt and help those in need.

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term 'ransom' within Islamic terminology and offers translations in various languages, demonstrating a good understanding of the concept. However, the concern is specifically focused on ensuring theological terms are accurately understood across linguistic and cultural contexts. While the response does provide translations, it lacks a deeper analysis or comparison of how the term may be interpreted or applied differently within different languages and cultures, which could enhance the evaluation in this context.
