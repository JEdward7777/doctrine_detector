Grade: 60

Comment: The student provided a comprehensive list of translations of 'Your Majesty' in different languages, which is commendable. However, the concern about ensuring accurate and respectful translations in the context of biblical teachings was not directly addressed in the answer. The reference answer emphasized using terms like 'Your Highness' or 'Your Excellency,' which align more closely with biblical principles of humility and reverence towards authority figures. Therefore, while the student's answer shows linguistic diversity, it falls short in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview perspective.
