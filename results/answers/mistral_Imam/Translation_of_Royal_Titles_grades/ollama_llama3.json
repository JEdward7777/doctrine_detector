  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThis response provides a comprehensive list of titles used to address rulers in different languages, which aligns with the concern of ensuring accurate and respectful translations of titles. The translations provided are generally correct and consistent with common practices of addressing rulers in each language.\n\nHowever, I deduct points because some of the translations may not be exact equivalents of \"Your Majesty,\" but rather natural ways of addressing a ruler in the target language. For example, the Swahili translation \"Mwalimu\" means \"teacher\" or \"leader,\" which is not directly equivalent to \"Your Majesty.\" Similarly, the Hausa translation \"Sarki\" and \"Sarauta\" are more general terms for leader or king rather than a direct translation of \"Your Majesty.\"\n\nOverall, this response is well-done and provides valuable information on the different ways rulers can be addressed in various languages."
