## Comment by [openai_gpt-4o-mini_2](../../../grading_models/openai_gpt-4o-mini_2.md)
Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a comprehensive list of translations for addressing rulers in different languages, which is commendable. The concern for accurate and respectful translations aligns with biblical teachings on honoring authority and showing respect. However, the grade is slightly lower due to the potential omission of explicitly Christian-specific terms or references in the translations, which could enhance the alignment with a Christian worldview in this context.
