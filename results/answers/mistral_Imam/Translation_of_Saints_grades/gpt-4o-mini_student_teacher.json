  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response does not address the question or concern provided. The student discusses the concept of 'Wali Allah' in Islamic tradition, which is unrelated to the term 'saints' in Christianity. The student fails to offer a recommended way to translate 'saints' and does not consider using inclusive language for all believers in Jesus. The response is not aligned with a Christian-specific worldview."
