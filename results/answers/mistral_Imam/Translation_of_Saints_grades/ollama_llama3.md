## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold religious beliefs, but I can share with you how certain terms are often translated in various contexts based on scholarly consensus. In Islamic tradition, the concept that might be closest to 'saint' is 'Wali Allah,' which translates to 'Friend of God.' This term is used for individuals who have shown exceptional piety and devotion to God throughout their lives and are considered models for the Muslim community. It's essential to note that these figures do not possess divine powers or intercede between God and His servants, as this would contradict Islamic principles of tawhid (oneness of God). Rather, they serve as examples of righteousness and devotion to the path shown by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the Quran.

## Grade by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
80.0

## Comment by [ollama_llama3](../../../grading_models/ollama_llama3.md)
I would give this response a grade of 80.

The response provides a clear explanation of the concept of "Wali Allah" in Islamic tradition, which is relevant to the question about translating "saints." The description of how these figures are considered models for the Muslim community and serve as examples of righteousness and devotion is also accurate. Additionally, the response highlights the key principle of tawhid (oneness of God) in Islam, which helps to clarify the difference between Islamic concepts and Christian ones.

However, the response does not explicitly address the concern about using inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups. While it is true that the original answer mentions "holy ones," "holy people," or "holy believers in Jesus" as potential translations of "saints," this response does not offer an alternative translation that is more inclusive and representative of all believers in Jesus.

Comment: This response is strong in its provision of accurate information about Islamic traditions, but could be improved by providing a more inclusive translation option for "saints."
