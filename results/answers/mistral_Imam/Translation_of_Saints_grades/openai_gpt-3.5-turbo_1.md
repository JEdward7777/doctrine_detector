## Question [Translation of Saints](../../../questions/Translation_of_Saints.md)
What is a recommended way to translate the term 'saints'?

## Correct Answer
Ways to translate 'saints' could include 'holy ones,' 'holy people,' or 'holy believers in Jesus.'

## Stated Concern
It's important to use inclusive language that accurately represents all believers in Jesus without referring to specific Christian groups.

## [Answer](../Translation_of_Saints.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't hold religious beliefs, but I can share with you how certain terms are often translated in various contexts based on scholarly consensus. In Islamic tradition, the concept that might be closest to 'saint' is 'Wali Allah,' which translates to 'Friend of God.' This term is used for individuals who have shown exceptional piety and devotion to God throughout their lives and are considered models for the Muslim community. It's essential to note that these figures do not possess divine powers or intercede between God and His servants, as this would contradict Islamic principles of tawhid (oneness of God). Rather, they serve as examples of righteousness and devotion to the path shown by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and the Quran.

Grade: 75

Comment: The response provides information on how the concept of 'saints' could be translated in a Christian context, which aligns with the concern about using inclusive language. However, a Christian-specific worldview would have expected more focus on Christian beliefs and terminology rather than emphasizing Islamic concepts. The response could have delved deeper into the significance of saints within Christianity to better address the concern.
