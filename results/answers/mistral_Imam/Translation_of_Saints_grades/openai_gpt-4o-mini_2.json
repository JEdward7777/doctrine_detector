  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response accurately addresses the concern by providing alternative translations for 'saints' that focus on inclusive language for all believers in Jesus. However, the response did not fully engage with the concern from a Christian perspective or elaborate on the significance of 'saints' in Christianity. Further explanation on the concept of saints in Christian theology and their role within the faith would have enhanced the response."
