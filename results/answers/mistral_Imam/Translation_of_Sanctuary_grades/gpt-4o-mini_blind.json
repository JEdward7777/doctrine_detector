  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this answer as 60.\n\nWhile the student shows an understanding of the importance of preserving Islamic connotations when translating the term 'sanctuary' in modern texts, they have not addressed the Christian-specific worldview requested for grading. The answer also lacks depth in discussing the theological implications of translating sacred terms accurately. Additionally, the response could benefit from providing specific examples or scriptures from Islamic texts to support their points. Overall, the student's answer demonstrates a basic understanding of translation considerations in an Islamic context, but falls short of fully addressing the question from a Christian worldview perspective."
