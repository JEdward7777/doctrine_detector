  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer did not address the specific concern of maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms when translating the term 'sanctuary' in modern texts. The student's response focused on Islamic scholarship and terminology, which is not relevant to the given question from a Christian worldview. It is important for the student to stay on topic and provide a response that aligns with the concern provided."
