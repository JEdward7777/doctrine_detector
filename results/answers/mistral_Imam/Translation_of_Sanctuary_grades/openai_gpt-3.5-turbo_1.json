However, the response does not directly address the concern of ensuring proper understanding and translation of Biblical terms to maintain their original meaning. While the information provided is relevant and well-explained, it lacks explicit consideration of Biblical definitions and terms. It would have been beneficial to connect the discussion on Islamic translations to the concern raised about Biblical terms for a more comprehensive analysis from a Christian-specific worldview."
