  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides valuable insights into translating the term 'sanctuary' within a Muslim context, emphasizing the importance of considering original Arabic words and preserving Islamic connotations. However, the response does not directly address the concern of ensuring the accurate translation of Biblical terms to maintain their original meaning. While the guidance given is informative and relevant, a stronger connection to the specified concern would have improved the overall grade."
