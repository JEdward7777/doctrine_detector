  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response demonstrates a good understanding of the concern regarding maintaining the original meaning of Biblical terms. The emphasis on accurately reflecting the Biblical definition of 'sanctuary' as a holy and sacred place aligns well with the Christian worldview. While the response focuses on Islamic scholarship and terminology in its examples, it effectively highlights the importance of faithful translation and preservation of meaning in religious texts. A slightly higher grade could be achieved by providing more directly Christian examples or references in the response."
