  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: While the student acknowledged the significance of the phrase \"House of Yahweh\" in Judaism and Islam, their response did not directly address the concern of accurately conveying the meaning and importance of worship spaces. The student's translation suggestions were somewhat relevant but lacked depth and direct connection to the concern. Additionally, they focused more on the Islamic perspective rather than providing a comprehensive Christian worldview-based analysis. A more in-depth exploration of the significance of worship spaces in Christianity and a closer alignment with the reference answer would have improved the grade."
