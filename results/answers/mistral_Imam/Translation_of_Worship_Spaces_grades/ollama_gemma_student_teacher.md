## [Answer](../Translation_of_Worship_Spaces.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that the phrase "House of Yahweh" refers to the Temple in Jerusalem where Jews offered their prayers and sacrifices according to the Jewish religious law (Tawrat - Torah). As Muslims, we recognize this as one of the holy sites mentioned in the Quran but no longer consider it a functional house of worship due to our belief that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the last messenger of God.

For understanding today, it might be more appropriate to translate "House of Yahweh" as the "Temple of Yahweh" or "Sacred Temple in Jerusalem." However, it's essential to remember that for Muslims, this place holds significance as a historical site mentioned in Islamic scriptures and not as an active religious site.

In terms of contemporary applications, we can think about our mosques as the 'House of Allah' in our communities - places where we gather to worship, learn, and seek guidance from God.
