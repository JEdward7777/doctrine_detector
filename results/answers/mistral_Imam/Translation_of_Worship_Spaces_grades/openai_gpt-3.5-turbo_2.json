The connection drawn to mosques as the 'House of Allah' in Muslim communities is a good reflection of the contemporary application. The concern for accurate translations conveying the meaning and importance of worship spaces is appropriately addressed. However, there could have been more emphasis on the theological differences between Islamic and Christian beliefs regarding the House of Yahweh/Temple in Jerusalem to provide a deeper understanding from a Christian worldview."
