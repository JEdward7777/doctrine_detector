It acknowledges the importance of accurate translations while maintaining the uniqueness of worship spaces in different faith traditions. The only area for improvement could be a more explicit reference to the unique understanding of Yahweh's presence in the Jewish temple from a Christian worldview, as this would enhance the analysis from a comparative religious perspective."
