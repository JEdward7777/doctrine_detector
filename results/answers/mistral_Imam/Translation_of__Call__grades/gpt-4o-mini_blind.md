 In the Biblical context, specifically referring to the naming of children, the original Hebrew phrase is "You shall call his name" (Genesis 17:5 and other places). Here are some alternative translations for this phrase from different English versions of the Bible:

1. King James Version (KJV): "And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
   Alternative: "You will name his name" or "You will give him a name"

2. New International Version (NIV): "As for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his descendants. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation."
   Alternative: "You will call his name" or "You will give him a specific name"

3. New Living Translation (NLT): "Now about Hagar's son, whom she named Ishmael, I have heard you talking about him. I will honor the pledge I made to Hagar. I will make him a great nation and assure him of a very large family. He will be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a tremendous ancestor."
   Alternative: "You will call his name" or "You will give him a special name"

4. New American Standard Bible (NASB): "As for Ishmael, listen to her; I will surely bless him, and I will make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation."
   Alternative: "You will name his name" or "You will give him a unique name"

Comment: The answer provides an adequate explanation of the original Hebrew phrase and offers relevant alternative translations from various English versions of the Bible. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the Biblical context and conveys the meanings effectively. However, to improve the grade, it could have further elaborated on the significance of naming in the Bible and perhaps included a reference to the importance of names in the Christian faith.
