  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's response as 80.\n\nWhile the student does provide alternative translations from various English versions of the Bible, they miss the opportunity to delve deeper into the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation. The reference answer from the teacher emphasizes the act of assigning a name, which the student fails to address directly in their response. However, the student does show a good understanding of the different ways the phrase \"You shall call his name\" can be translated in English, which deserves recognition.\n\nOverall, the student's answer is thorough in providing alternative translations but lacks deeper analysis of the significance of naming in the biblical context. Therefore, I would deduct some points for not directly addressing the concern of understanding the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation."
