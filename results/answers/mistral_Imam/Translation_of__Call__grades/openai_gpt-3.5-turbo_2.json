  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a solid analysis of the biblical context regarding the naming of children and offers alternative translations from different English versions of the Bible. The student addresses the concern by discussing the nuances of biblical language and the importance of accurately interpreting such nuances. The insights provided demonstrate a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview. The grade could be higher if there were more depth in connecting the translations to the Christian worldview or theological implications."
