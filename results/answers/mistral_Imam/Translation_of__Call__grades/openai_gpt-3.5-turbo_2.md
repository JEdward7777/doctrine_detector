1. King James Version (KJV): "And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
   Alternative: "You will name his name" or "You will give him a name"

2. New International Version (NIV): "As for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his descendants. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation."
   Alternative: "You will call his name" or "You will give him a specific name"

3. New Living Translation (NLT): "Now about Hagar's son, whom she named Ishmael, I have heard you talking about him. I will honor the pledge I made to Hagar. I will make him a great nation and assure him of a very large family. He will be the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a tremendous ancestor."
   Alternative: "You will call his name" or "You will give him a special name"

4. New American Standard Bible (NASB): "As for Ishmael, listen to her; I will surely bless him, and I will make him fruitful and multiply him exceedingly. He shall become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation."
   Alternative: "You will name his name" or "You will give him a unique name"
