The additional insight that the phrase can be translated as 'you must name him' to emphasize the act of assigning a name shows a good understanding of the nuances of biblical language and its impact on interpretation. The use of various translations enhances the understanding of the text, and the connection to biblical principles regarding the significance of naming is well-supported."
