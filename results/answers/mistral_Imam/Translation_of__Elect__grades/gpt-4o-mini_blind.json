  "grade_comment": "Grade: 75\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of how the translation of \"elect\" has differed between older and modern English Bible versions, and the impact it has on understanding Scripture. The student demonstrates an understanding of the theological implications of these translation differences. However, the inclusion of the Muslim perspective, while interesting, is not directly relevant to the question regarding the translation of \"elect\" in English Bible versions. To improve, the student could focus on further exploring the doctrinal implications within Christianity and provide more detailed examples or scriptures to support their points."
