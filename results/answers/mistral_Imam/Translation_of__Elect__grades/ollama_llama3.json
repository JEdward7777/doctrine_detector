  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response addresses the concern of clarifying the meaning of biblical texts in relation to being chosen by God, specifically discussing the evolution of translation from older English versions like the King James Version (KJV) to modern translations like the New International Version (NIV) or the New Living Translation (NLT). It also provides some historical context and acknowledges the significance of these differences on understanding Scripture.\n\nHowever, the response does not fully engage with the concern. While it mentions that older Bible versions use 'elect' in both the Old and New Testaments, and modern versions often use 'chosen ones' in the Old Testament and 'elect' primarily in the New Testament, it could be more explicit about how this affects readers' understanding of their identity as God's people.\n\nAdditionally, the response takes an unexpected turn by introducing a Muslim perspective on predestination, which while relevant to the broader theme of election, seems tangential to the main concern. A more direct connection between the biblical texts and the concept of being chosen by God would strengthen this response.\n\nOverall, the response provides some useful information and insights, but could be more focused and explicit in its discussion of the concern."
