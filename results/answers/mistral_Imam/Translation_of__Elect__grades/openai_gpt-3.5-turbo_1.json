  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the evolution of the term \"elect\" in the Bible and how its interpretation has varied in older and modern English translations. It effectively addresses the concern by discussing the impact of using different terms like \"chosen ones\" and \"elect\" on the reader's understanding of their identity as God's people. The response is well-written, informative, and demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from a Christian worldview."
