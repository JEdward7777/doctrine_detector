  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a comprehensive list of translation suggestions for the term 'beloved' based on the context of love, particularly from an Islamic perspective, which is commendable. The student appropriately emphasized the importance of considering cultural nuances and consulting reliable Islamic resources for accurate understanding and interpretation. However, doctrinally speaking, some terms mentioned may not directly convey the full depth and significance of the term 'beloved' in Christian theology, which could have been addressed to enhance doctrinal correctness. Overall, a solid effort with room for deeper theological exploration."
