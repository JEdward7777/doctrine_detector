  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** \nThe student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of \"beloved\" and provides several accurate and appropriate Arabic translations for the term. \n\nThe inclusion of examples from Islamic sources adds depth and authenticity to the translation suggestions. \n\nHowever, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the nuances of the different terms, particularly in their specific contexts. Additionally, the student's suggestion of \"loved one\" or \"my dear friend\" in the context of the reference answer aligns well with the Christian worldview's emphasis on love and companionship."
