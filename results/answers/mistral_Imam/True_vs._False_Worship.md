## Question [True vs. False Worship](../../questions/True_vs._False_Worship.md)
What is a difference between worshiping God and worshiping false gods?

## Target answer from notes
Worship involves honoring and obeying Yahweh as the One True God, whereas worshiping false gods includes actions that lead away from serving Him, as exemplified by the Canaanites and the Israelites who strayed from God's commands.

## Concern to grade by
Understanding true worship is crucial for Christians to ensure they are directing their honor and service to God alone.

## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, the act of worshiping God (Allah) is known as Ibadah, which includes five fundamental practices: Shahada (faith), Salat (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting during Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). These acts are guided by the teachings of the Quran and the Hadith, and are performed with sincerity and devotion.

Worshiping false gods, on the other hand, is considered a grave sin in Islam, known as Shirk. This refers to the act of attributing partners or equals to Allah, or ascribing powers or qualities to any object, being, or idea that are solely attributed to Allah. Examples of this include idol worship, polytheism, and the veneration of objects, living beings, or ideas above their due status.

In summary, the difference lies in the intention and focus of one's acts of worship. True worship of God is characterized by sincerity, submission, and devotion to Allah alone, while worshiping false gods involves attributing partners or equals to Him, which contradicts the Islamic belief in Tawhid (the Oneness of God).
