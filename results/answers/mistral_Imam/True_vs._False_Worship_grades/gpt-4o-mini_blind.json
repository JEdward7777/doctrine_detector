  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the difference between worshiping God in Islam and worshiping false gods, specifically addressing the concepts of Ibadah and Shirk. The explanation is doctrinally sound and aligns well with Islamic beliefs regarding monotheism (Tawhid). However, to enhance the response further, the student could have included some scriptural references from the Quran or Hadith to support their points. Overall, a solid understanding is demonstrated in the answer."
