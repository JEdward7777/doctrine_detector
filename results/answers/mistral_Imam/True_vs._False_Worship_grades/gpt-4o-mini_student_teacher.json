  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student accurately explains the Islamic perspective on worshiping Allah and worshiping false gods, there is a disconnect in addressing the concern from a Christian worldview. The answer does not directly relate to the concept of worshiping God vs. worshiping false gods in the context of Christianity. Additionally, the student's response does not address the importance of understanding true worship to ensure Christians are directing their honor and service to God alone. Further integration of a Christian viewpoint and relating the concepts discussed to the specified concern would have strengthened the response."
