It effectively contrasts the idea of Shirk in Islam with the Christian understanding of worshiping Yahweh as the One True God. The connection to the concern raised about the importance of Christians directing their honor and service to God alone is well-addressed. The response could have further emphasized the unique Christian belief in the Trinity and the significance of Jesus Christ in Christian worship."
