  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 85.\n\nThe answer provides a comprehensive overview of how to distinguish between a true prophet of God and a false prophet from an Islamic perspective. The student addresses various key points such as the message, consistency, followers, miracles, prophecies, character and conduct, support from previous scriptures, and the reaction of people. The response also emphasizes the importance of approaching such matters with wisdom, patience, and humility, as well as seeking guidance from learned scholars.\n\nHowever, from a Christian perspective, there are doctrinal differences in how prophets are discerned. The response does not incorporate Christian beliefs or criteria for distinguishing true prophets from false prophets, which would be essential in providing a fully accurate and comprehensive answer within this specific worldview.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from an Islamic standpoint, but in the context of grading with a Christian worldview emphasis, the grade is slightly lower due to the lack of incorporating Christian criteria for discerning true prophets."
