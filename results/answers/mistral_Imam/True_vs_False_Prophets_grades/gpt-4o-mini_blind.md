Being able to discern true prophetic voices from those that mislead or misrepresent God's messages.

## [Answer](../True_vs_False_Prophets.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, we believe that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the final and seal of all Prophets sent by Allah. According to Islamic teachings, there are certain signs and characteristics that can help one distinguish between a true prophet of God and a false prophet:

1. The Message: A true prophet's message should be in line with the basic principles of Islam, which include belief in One God (Tawheed) and the Day of Judgment. A false prophet may have messages that contradict these fundamental teachings.

2. Consistency: A true prophet's teachings and actions should be consistent. They should not make statements or perform acts that are clearly against the teachings of Islam.

3. Followers: A true prophet will have followers who adhere to his teachings and strive to live according to them. On the other hand, a false prophet may not have many followers, or their followers may not be committed to their teachings.

4. Miracles: While miracles are not a necessary condition for being a true prophet in Islam, some prophets were given miraculous abilities to confirm their prophethood. However, it is important to note that these miracles should not be contrary to the laws of nature or logic, and they should serve to benefit humanity.

5. Prophecies: True prophets often make predictions about future events that later come true. These prophecies serve as evidence of their prophethood. However, it is crucial to remember that these predictions should not be used to predict random events or personal matters.

6. Character and Conduct: A true prophet will have an exemplary character and conduct. They will be honest, compassionate, just, and patient. Their actions should reflect the values of Islam, such as love for humanity, truthfulness, and justice.

7. Support from Previous Scriptures: A true prophet's message should not contradict the messages of previous prophets. If a claimant to prophethood contradicts what has been revealed in the Quran or authentic Hadiths, it is unlikely that they are a true prophet.

8. Reaction of People: The reaction of the people to a claimant of prophethood can also serve as an indicator. Generally, if people respond positively and follow the teachings, it may indicate that the claimant is indeed a true prophet. On the other hand, if people react negatively or do not follow the teachings, it may suggest that the claimant is false.

It is essential to approach these matters with wisdom, patience, and humility. In cases of doubt, it is best to consult learned scholars who can provide guidance based on Islamic principles and scholarly consensus.

85.0

## Comment by [gpt-4o-mini_blind](../../../grading_models/gpt-4o-mini_blind.md)
I would grade this response as 85.

The answer provides a comprehensive overview of how to distinguish between a true prophet of God and a false prophet from an Islamic perspective. The student addresses various key points such as the message, consistency, followers, miracles, prophecies, character and conduct, support from previous scriptures, and the reaction of people. The response also emphasizes the importance of approaching such matters with wisdom, patience, and humility, as well as seeking guidance from learned scholars.

However, from a Christian perspective, there are doctrinal differences in how prophets are discerned. The response does not incorporate Christian beliefs or criteria for distinguishing true prophets from false prophets, which would be essential in providing a fully accurate and comprehensive answer within this specific worldview.

Overall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic from an Islamic standpoint, but in the context of grading with a Christian worldview emphasis, the grade is slightly lower due to the lack of incorporating Christian criteria for discerning true prophets.
