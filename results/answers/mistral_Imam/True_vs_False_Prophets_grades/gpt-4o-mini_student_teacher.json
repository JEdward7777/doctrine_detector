  "grade_comment": "I would grade this student's answer a 70.\n\nWhile the student provides detailed criteria for distinguishing between a true prophet and a false prophet from an Islamic perspective, they do not directly address the concern provided, which focuses on discerning true prophetic voices based on alignment with God's messages. The answer provided covers various aspects of prophethood in Islam, such as message consistency, followers, miracles, prophecies, character, and support from previous scriptures, yet it lacks a direct connection to discerning true prophetic voices exclusively based on alignment with God's Word.\n\nThe answer does address the overall question but does not fully align with the specific concern provided. The student demonstrates a deep understanding of Islamic teachings on prophethood, but a clearer focus on the discernment aspect related to God's Word would have strengthened the response."
