The response also incorporates elements of character, consistency, followers, miracles, prophecies, and support from previous Scriptures, which provide a comprehensive approach to evaluating prophetic claims. The emphasis on seeking guidance from learned scholars aligns with the idea of seeking wisdom and counsel in making such discernments."
