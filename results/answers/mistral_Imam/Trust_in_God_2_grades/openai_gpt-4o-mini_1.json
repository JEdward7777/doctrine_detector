It also correctly highlights the importance of faith over works for salvation, as supported by Ephesians 2:8-9. The mention of repentance, confession, and baptism as expressions of faith in Jesus aligns well with Christian teachings. The response effectively addresses the concern by establishing a solid foundation of trust in Jesus based on biblical references."
