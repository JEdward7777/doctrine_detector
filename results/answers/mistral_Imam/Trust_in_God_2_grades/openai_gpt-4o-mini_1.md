## Question [Trust in God 2](../../../questions/Trust_in_God_2.md)
What does it mean to trust in Jesus according to Christian teachings?

## Correct Answer
To trust in Jesus means to believe that he is God, to believe that he died on the cross to pay for our sins, and to rely on him to save us.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the foundation of Christian faith in relation to trust.

## [Answer](../Trust_in_God_2.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian faith, trusting in Jesus primarily refers to accepting Him as the Son of God, the Savior, and the way to eternal life. According to the New Testament, this belief is based on faith rather than works or deeds (Ephesians 2:8-9).

This trust or faith in Jesus is demonstrated through repentance (turning away from sin), confession (acknowledgment of faith in Jesus as Savior and Lord), and baptism (a symbolic act of death to sin and resurrection with Christ). Christians believe that Jesus died on the cross for the sins of humanity, providing salvation and forgiveness (Romans 3:21-26; Romans 5:8).

However, it is important to note that the interpretation of Christian teachings can vary among different Christian denominations and individuals. It is always good to seek guidance from knowledgeable and reputable sources within Christianity when discussing these topics.
