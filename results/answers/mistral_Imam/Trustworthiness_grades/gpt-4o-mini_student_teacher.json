  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of how one can demonstrate trustworthiness based on biblical principles, incorporating relevant verses from the Bible. However, the student did not directly address the concern of encouraging followers to live in accordance with Biblical teachings on integrity and reliability. While the student's response is informative and demonstrates a good understanding of trustworthiness in a Christian context, it could have been improved by explicitly connecting the actions of trustworthiness to the encouragement of others to live by these principles as outlined in the concern."
