## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, it's important to note that the concept of the Antichrist (Dajjal) originates from Hadith (sayings of Prophet Muhammad PBUH), not the Book of Revelation. According to many Hadiths, the Dajjal will appear before the Day of Judgment and claim to be God or a prophet. He will deceive people through miracles and false promises. However, Muslims believe that truth can only be found in following Prophet Muhammad PBUH and the Quran, as these are the last divine revelations sent by Allah SWT.

In Christian tradition, as you mentioned, the ultimate antichrist is often identified as a figure who will deceive humanity before the Second Coming of Christ. However, this concept doesn't align exactly with the Islamic belief about the Dajjal. It's essential to respect and understand different religious beliefs while maintaining our own faith.
