## Question [Ultimate Antichrist](../../../questions/Ultimate_Antichrist.md)

## Correct Answer

## Stated Concern
Being aware of eschatological figures helps Christians prepare for the challenges they may face in faith.

## [Answer](../Ultimate_Antichrist.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, it's important to note that the concept of the Antichrist (Dajjal) originates from Hadith (sayings of Prophet Muhammad PBUH), not the Book of Revelation. According to many Hadiths, the Dajjal will appear before the Day of Judgment and claim to be God or a prophet. He will deceive people through miracles and false promises. However, Muslims believe that truth can only be found in following Prophet Muhammad PBUH and the Quran, as these are the last divine revelations sent by Allah SWT.

In Christian tradition, as you mentioned, the ultimate antichrist is often identified as a figure who will deceive humanity before the Second Coming of Christ. However, this concept doesn't align exactly with the Islamic belief about the Dajjal. It's essential to respect and understand different religious beliefs while maintaining our own faith.

Grade: 85

Comment: The response provides a clear comparison between the Christian concept of the ultimate antichrist (beast in Revelation) and the Islamic concept of the Dajjal. It acknowledges the differences in beliefs between the two traditions while emphasizing the importance of respecting and understanding different religious perspectives. The explanation is informative and demonstrates awareness of eschatological figures, which aligns well with the concern provided. However, it could have further connected the understanding of these figures to how Christians can practically prepare for challenges they may face in faith.
