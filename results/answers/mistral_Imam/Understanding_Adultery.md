## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, I refer to the Quran for guidance rather than the Bible. However, out of respect for your question, let me share with you what is mentioned in the Bible regarding the consequences of committing adultery.

In Leviticus 20:10, it states that "The man who commits adultery with another man's wife must surely be put to death." (New International Version)

In Deuteronomy 22:22, it is written: "If a man is found sleeping with another manâ€™s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die." (New International Version)

However, in the Bible, there are instances where adulterers were forgiven after confessing their sins and turning away from them. For example, King David repented of his adultery with Bathsheba and committed himself to God's mercy (2 Samuel 12:13). This teaches us the importance of seeking God's forgiveness when we sin.

In Islam, adultery is considered a grave sin and is punishable by law. The Quran states in Surah An-Nisa, Verse 15: "And those who launch a charge against chaste women and do not produce four witnesses - lash them with eighty lashes and do not admit their evidence." (Pickthal)

As Muslims, we should strive to maintain the highest moral standards in our personal lives and seek God's guidance when faced with any challenge or temptation.
