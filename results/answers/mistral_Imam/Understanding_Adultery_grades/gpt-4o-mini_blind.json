However, the focus should have been solely on the Bible, as the question specifically asked for Biblical references. Additionally, the response could have delved deeper into the theological implications and teachings related to adultery in Christianity. An improvement would be to provide a more in-depth analysis from a Christian worldview without interweaving Islamic beliefs."
