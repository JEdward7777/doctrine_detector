  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided relevant verses from the Bible regarding the consequences of committing adultery, which is commendable. However, the response lacks a clear evaluation of the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality, as was the specified concern. Additionally, the student primarily focused on Islamic perspectives rather than providing a thorough analysis from a Christian worldview. To improve the grade, the student should have delved deeper into the spiritual and relational implications of adultery within a Christian context."
