The student effectively addresses the concern by discussing the spiritual and relational consequences of adultery in both faiths, citing relevant scripture from the Bible and Quran. The inclusion of examples from King David in the Bible and the punishment for adultery in Islam adds depth to the analysis. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the impact of adultery on marriage and spirituality within a Christian-specific worldview."
