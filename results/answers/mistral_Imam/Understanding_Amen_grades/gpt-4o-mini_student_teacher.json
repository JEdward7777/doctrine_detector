  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student's answer primarily focuses on the Islamic perspective on the term \"Amen\" and its usage in prayers, which is not directly relevant to the Christian context. While the student briefly mentions some instances where \"Amen\" is used in Islamic tradition, the lack of a clear connection to the Christian understanding of prayer detracts from the overall relevance of the response. More emphasis on the Christian significance of \"Amen\" at the end of prayers would have been beneficial for a higher grade."
