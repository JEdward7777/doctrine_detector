  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response provides a good explanation of how \"Amen\" is used in Islamic tradition, particularly in supplications or du'as. However, the connection to the significance of prayer in Christian practice is not directly addressed, which would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective. A deeper analysis linking the concept of \"Amen\" to the understanding of prayer in Christianity would have improved the grade."
