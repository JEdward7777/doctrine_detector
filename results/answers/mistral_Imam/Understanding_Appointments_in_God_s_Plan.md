## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In a Christian context, the concept of being "appointed to eternal life" refers to the belief that through faith in Jesus Christ, one can attain everlasting life after death. This belief is rooted in the Bible and specifically in the teachings of Jesus (John 3:16, John 10:28, etc.).

In Christian theology, eternal life is considered a gift given by God to those who believe in His Son, Jesus Christ, and accept Him as their Savior. It's not something that is earned through good works or personal effort, but rather it comes through faith. This concept is based on the idea that Jesus overcame death through his resurrection, offering eternal life to all who follow him.

In Islam, the equivalent concept would be attaining paradise (Jannah) in the hereafter, which is earned through living a righteous and pious life according to the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, it's important to note that interpretations can vary among different sects and scholars within each religion.
