  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 85/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a clear understanding of the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context. It accurately explains that the belief is rooted in the Bible and emphasizes the role of faith in receiving everlasting life. The inclusion of references to specific Bible verses adds credibility to the response. However, the student could have elaborated on the relationship between God's sovereignty and grace in the context of salvation."
