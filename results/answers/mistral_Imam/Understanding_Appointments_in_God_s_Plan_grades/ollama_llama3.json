  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response does a good job of explaining the concept of being \"appointed to eternal life\" in a Christian context, highlighting the idea that it is a gift given by God through faith in Jesus Christ. The reference to John 3:16 and John 10:28 also shows an understanding of the biblical basis for this doctrine.\n\nHowever, the response could be stronger in addressing the concern about divine selection and grace in salvation. While it touches on the idea that eternal life is a gift given by God, it does not explicitly explore the concept of divine selection or grace in relation to salvation. The phrase \"reflecting His sovereign will and grace\" is somewhat vague and could be further developed.\n\nAdditionally, while the response mentions Islam and paradise as an equivalent concept, this section seems somewhat disconnected from the main topic of being \"appointed to eternal life\" and does not add much depth to the discussion.\n\nOverall, I would give this response a grade of 85 because it provides some good explanations of the Christian doctrine but could be stronger in addressing the concern about divine selection and grace in salvation."
