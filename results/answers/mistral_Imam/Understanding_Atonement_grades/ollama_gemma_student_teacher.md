## [Answer](../Understanding_Atonement.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Islamic perspective, Christianity and Islam share many common beliefs, but there are some differences regarding the concept of Jesus (peace be upon him) and his role in salvation. In Islam, Jesus is considered a prophet of God (like Muhammad peace be upon him) and not the son of God.

Regarding the concept of atonement for sin through Christ's death, it is an essential belief in Christianity that stems from its understanding of original sin and the need for redemption. According to Christian belief, Adam and Eve's disobedience in the Garden of Eden led to the fall of mankind, making humanity inherently sinful. Jesus (peace be upon him) is believed to have been sent as a sacrifice to atone for this sin, offering himself as the perfect human who could fulfill the Law and pay the price for humanity's transgressions through his crucifixion and resurrection.

In contrast, Islam does not recognize original sin or the need for atonement through the death of a prophet or any other intermediary. Muslims believe that every individual is accountable for their own actions and will be judged accordingly on the Day of Judgment. Good deeds can earn forgiveness and salvation, while sins must be repented for sincerely to be forgiven by Allah (God).

In conclusion, while the Christian belief in Christ's death as a permanent atonement for sin holds great significance within Christianity, it is not shared by Islam. However, both religions stress the importance of repentance and turning towards God for salvation.
