However, the response primarily focuses on comparing Christianity and Islam rather than delving deeply into the significance of Jesus' sacrifice within Christian belief. More emphasis on the unique salvific role of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology would have strengthened the response from a Christian worldview perspective."
