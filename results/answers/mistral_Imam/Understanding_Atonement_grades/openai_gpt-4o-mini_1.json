It acknowledges the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice in Christian theology, albeit in a secondary manner compared to the Islamic perspective. The response could have further emphasized the unique Christian belief in the necessity of Christ's sacrifice for permanent reconciliation with God to fully address the concern."
