It effectively contrasts the Christian belief in Christ's death as the ultimate sacrifice for atonement with the Islamic view of personal accountability and repentance. However, the response could have delved deeper into the unique Christian theological understanding of the centrality of Jesus' sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God."
