The mention of the transformation of the heart and life, sharing in Christ's righteousness, redemption, and eternal life, and the role of grace through faith is doctrinally sound. However, the comparison with Islam could be seen as risking syncretism, as Christian theology believes in the unique salvific role of Jesus Christ that sets it apart from other religions. It would have been more appropriate to focus solely on explaining the Christian concept of being \"in Christ\" without drawing comparisons to Islam in this context."
