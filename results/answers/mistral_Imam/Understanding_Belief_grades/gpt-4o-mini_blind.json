  "grade_comment": "I would grade this response as 80.\n\nThe student effectively distinguishes between believing in something and believing someone within an Islamic context, highlighting the importance of both aspects of faith in Islam. The explanation is clear, pointing out the differences in meaning and application. However, the response could have been strengthened by referencing specific verses from the Quran that emphasize the importance of both believing in Allah and His Messenger, Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), as well as elaborating more on the relationship between belief in the teachings of Islam and trust in the Prophet's guidance. Additionally, it would have been beneficial for the student to clarify the interconnectedness of these beliefs and how they influence the daily lives of Muslims.\n\nOverall, a solid response demonstrating understanding of the topic, but with room for further depth and elaboration."
