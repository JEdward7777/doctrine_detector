  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on faith, belief, and trust in relation to Allah and Prophet Muhammad. They accurately distinguished between believing in something and believing someone within an Islamic context. However, the response focused solely on Islamic terminology and did not explicitly address the nuances of faith in relation to trust in God and others from a broader Christian worldview perspective. Therefore, deducting some points for not directly addressing the concern provided."
