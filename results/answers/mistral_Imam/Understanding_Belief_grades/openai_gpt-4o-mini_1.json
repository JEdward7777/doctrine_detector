It connects the concept of belief in something with the fundamental tenets of the faith, and belief in someone with trusting and following the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) and putting faith in Allah. The Christian worldview would appreciate the emphasis on trust in God and His guidance, as well as the importance of following the teachings and examples set by religious figures."
