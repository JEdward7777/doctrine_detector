## [Answer](../Understanding_Biblical_Naming.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian Bible, the name "John" (Yahya in Arabic) holds significant religious and historical importance. The name John appears multiple times throughout the Bible, most notably with John the Baptist (known as Yahya al-Nabi in Islam), who is considered a prophet in both religions.

In the context of biblical naming, when it is stated that "His name is called John," it signifies the individual's identity and religious affiliation. In the case of John the Baptist, his name was chosen by God and given to him by his parents to reflect his spiritual role as a forerunner of Jesus (Isa).

From an Islamic perspective, we recognize John the Baptist as one of the important prophets mentioned in the Quran. In Surah Maryam, Allah (SWT) mentions that the mother of John the Baptist was chosen specifically to give birth to a prophet and that his name would be John.

From this understanding, when we see the Bible stating "His name is called John," it highlights the individual's identity as a prophet and the fulfillment of divine revelation in his life.
