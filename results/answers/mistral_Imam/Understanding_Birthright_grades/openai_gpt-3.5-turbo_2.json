  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The response effectively discusses the consequences of Esau's choice to sell his birthright and Jacob's gain of privileges, aligning with the Christian perspective on the significance of choices and their spiritual consequences. However, the response predominantly focuses on the Muslim perspective and themes, rather than emphasizing how this Biblical account specifically relates to Christian beliefs and teachings. To improve the grade, more explicit connections to Christian theology and the Christian view on the story of Esau and Jacob could have been made."
