  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough comparison between the Islamic concept of \"blameless\" and the biblical examples of blameless individuals like Abraham, Joseph, and Job. However, the response did not specifically address the concern mentioned about the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context. The answer also did not directly align with the reference answer provided, which focused on obeying God wholeheartedly rather than just having unwavering faith or maintaining integrity. The student's answer could have been improved by drawing more direct parallels between the biblical concept of blamelessness and the reference answer provided."
