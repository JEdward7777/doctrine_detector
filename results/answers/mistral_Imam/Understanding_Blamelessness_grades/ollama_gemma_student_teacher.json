They provide clear examples from scripture to support their claims and draw parallels to Islamic teachings, demonstrating a thoughtful and nuanced approach to the subject. However, the answer could benefit from a more direct connection to the specific concern raised in the prompt, which emphasizes the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context."
