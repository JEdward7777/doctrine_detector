However, the response could have more explicitly addressed the concern about the distinction between being blameless and being sinless in a Christian context. There is a strong connection made between being blameless and having faith, obedience, integrity, and patience, which aligns with Christian teachings, but a clearer emphasis on the role of grace in forgiveness of sin would have strengthened the Christian worldview perspective."
