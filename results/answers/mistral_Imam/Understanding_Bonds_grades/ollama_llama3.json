  "grade": 85.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 85.\n\nThe response effectively explores the concept of \"bonds\" in Islamic teachings, drawing parallels with Biblical concepts such as covenant and promise. It provides specific Quranic verses to support its claims, demonstrating a clear understanding of Islamic scripture. The response also thoughtfully considers the implications of these concepts for spiritual obligations and relationships with God.\n\nHowever, I deduct a few points because the response does not explicitly relate its findings back to the concern about maintaining a healthy spiritual life through vows and commitments. While it touches on the idea that upholding one's end of the agreement with God is important, it could have more directly addressed how these concepts contribute to a spiritually fulfilling life.\n\nOverall, this response demonstrates strong understanding of Islamic scripture and concepts, but could benefit from more explicit connection-making between its findings and the concern at hand."
