It effectively addresses the concern by emphasizing the importance of upholding vows and commitments in maintaining a healthy spiritual life from an Islamic perspective. The response could have further emphasized the consequences of breaking these commitments and the importance of repentance and forgiveness in restoring the spiritual bond with God."
