  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a detailed explanation of how Muslims might interpret the concept of cleanliness and purity in Islam, they strayed from the specific focus on Biblical definitions as requested in the question. Additionally, the student's response lacks the Christian-specific perspective necessary for this assignment. The answer would have benefitted from a clearer connection to Biblical teachings on cleanliness and moral purity."
