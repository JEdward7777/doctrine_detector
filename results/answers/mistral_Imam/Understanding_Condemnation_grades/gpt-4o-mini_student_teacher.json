  "grade_comment": "Grade: 20\n\nComment: The student's response completely misses the mark on addressing the Christian perspective on condemnation and grace as outlined in the Bible. They incorrectly provide interpretations from an Islamic standpoint, which is not relevant to the question posed. The response lacks a Christian worldview and fails to engage with the specific verses mentioned in the question."
