However, the response did not directly address the question regarding the definition and responsibilities of being a disciple of Jesus according to the provided content. The student's answer focused more on Islamic beliefs about Jesus rather than addressing the Christian perspective on discipleship. Incorporating more specific examples or references to the provided content would have strengthened the response."
