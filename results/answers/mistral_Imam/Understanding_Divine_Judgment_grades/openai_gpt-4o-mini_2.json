  "grade_comment": "Grade: 95\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the concern by clearly articulating the distinction between God's perfect judgment and flawed human judgment, as contrasted in the Bible. It provides a strong biblical perspective on the topic and integrates it with relevant information from both Islam and Christianity to highlight key differences and similarities in the concept of judgment. The response demonstrates a deep understanding of the theological implications of God's judgment and human fallibility, offering a well-rounded perspective."
