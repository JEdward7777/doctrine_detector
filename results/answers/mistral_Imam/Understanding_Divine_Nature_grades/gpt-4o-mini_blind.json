The inclusion of various essential qualities attributed to God is accurate, along with the mention of debates among Muslim scholars regarding the nature of God's attributes. However, the response could have strengthened its doctrinal correctness by emphasizing the transcendence of God's nature beyond any resemblance to human attributes, as emphasized in Islamic theology to safeguard the concept of Tawheed (Oneness of God). A more explicit reference to the Quranic teachings and Hadith literature could have added depth to the explanation."
