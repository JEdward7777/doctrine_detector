## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Nature.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, the term "divine nature" or "Al-Fitrah Al-Ilahiyyah" (الفترة الإلهيّة) refers to the inherent, natural disposition that human beings were created with before any influence of culture, society, or personal choices. This concept is based on the verse in the Quran (7:145): "We have certainly created man in the best of statures."

When we discuss God's characteristics, we can say that His divine nature implies several qualities that are essential to our understanding of Him. Some of these characteristics include His perfection, omniscience (knowledge of all things), omnipotence (power over all things), mercy, wisdom, justice, and uniqueness or Oneness (Tawheed). These qualities are inherent in God's essence and cannot be changed, as He is the Perfect Being.

However, it is essential to note that Muslim scholars have debated the nature of God's attributes throughout history. Some believe that His attributes are similar to human attributes but infinite in degree (Al-Mushabbihah), while others argue that God's attributes are unlike any human quality (Ash-Shaksiyyah). Ultimately, these debates emphasize the need for humility when discussing God and seeking a deeper understanding of His nature through revelation and contemplation.

Comment: The response provides a good understanding of the concept of divine nature in Islam and its implications for God's characteristics. The inclusion of various essential qualities attributed to God is accurate, along with the mention of debates among Muslim scholars regarding the nature of God's attributes. However, the response could have strengthened its doctrinal correctness by emphasizing the transcendence of God's nature beyond any resemblance to human attributes, as emphasized in Islamic theology to safeguard the concept of Tawheed (Oneness of God). A more explicit reference to the Quranic teachings and Hadith literature could have added depth to the explanation.
