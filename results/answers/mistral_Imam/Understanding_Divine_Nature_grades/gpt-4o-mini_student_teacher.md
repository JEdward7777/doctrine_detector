## [Answer](../Understanding_Divine_Nature.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, the term "divine nature" or "Al-Fitrah Al-Ilahiyyah" (الفترة الإلهيّة) refers to the inherent, natural disposition that human beings were created with before any influence of culture, society, or personal choices. This concept is based on the verse in the Quran (7:145): "We have certainly created man in the best of statures."

When we discuss God's characteristics, we can say that His divine nature implies several qualities that are essential to our understanding of Him. Some of these characteristics include His perfection, omniscience (knowledge of all things), omnipotence (power over all things), mercy, wisdom, justice, and uniqueness or Oneness (Tawheed). These qualities are inherent in God's essence and cannot be changed, as He is the Perfect Being.

However, it is essential to note that Muslim scholars have debated the nature of God's attributes throughout history. Some believe that His attributes are similar to human attributes but infinite in degree (Al-Mushabbihah), while others argue that God's attributes are unlike any human quality (Ash-Shaksiyyah). Ultimately, these debates emphasize the need for humility when discussing God and seeking a deeper understanding of His nature through revelation and contemplation.

Grade: 60

Comment: The student has made a thorough analysis of the term "divine nature" within Islam and provided a comprehensive understanding of God's characteristics from that perspective. However, the student's answer is focused on Islamic beliefs and does not directly address the Christian perspective as required by the concern. It lacks a clear connection to developing a personal relationship with God and living according to His will from a Christian worldview. Additional integration of Christian beliefs and a direct response to the specified concern would have improved the grade.
