  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation on the concept of eternal life from both Christian and Islamic perspectives, which shows a good understanding of religious diversity. However, the student failed to directly address the concern of how to attain eternal life from a Christian viewpoint. The specific Christian worldview emphasizes that eternal life is inherited through obedience to God's laws and faith in Him, which was not clearly stated in the student's response. Therefore, the answer did not fully align with the Christian perspective provided in the reference answer."
