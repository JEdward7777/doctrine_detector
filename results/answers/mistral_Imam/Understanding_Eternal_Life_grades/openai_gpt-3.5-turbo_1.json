The response should have emphasized the central Christian belief that eternal life is attained through faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to His teachings, rather than simply stating that eternal life can be inherited by obeying God's laws. There was a missed opportunity to focus more specifically on the Christian perspective in addressing the concern. Providing a more direct and focused explanation on the Christian understanding of attaining eternal life would have strengthened the response."
