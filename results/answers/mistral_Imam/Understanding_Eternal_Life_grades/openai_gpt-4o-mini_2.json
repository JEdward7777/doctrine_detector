The references to biblical verses support the discussion. However, the response could have emphasized the unique Christian perspective more explicitly and focused on the importance of faith in Jesus Christ as the central tenet for attaining eternal life. Clarifying the distinctive Christian teaching on salvation through faith in Christ could have further strengthened the Biblical perspective within a Christian worldview."
