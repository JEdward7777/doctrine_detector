  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The answer provides a general understanding of the concepts of \"evil\" and \"wickedness\" from both the Bible and the Quran. However, to improve the grade, the response could have focused more on the biblical perspective and provided specific examples from the Bible to illustrate the distinctions between evil and wickedness. Additionally, while mentioning the Quranic terms is informative, the focus should have been primarily on the biblical worldview as per the question. A more detailed and precise explanation with scriptural references would have enhanced the answer."
