# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Bible, both "evil" (Ra' in Hebrew or Kharab in Arabic) and "wickedness" (Awwal in Hebrew or Fujur in Arabic) are used to describe negative or immoral actions. However, there is a subtle distinction between them.

Evil generally refers to an action that is morally wrong due to its nature, regardless of the intention behind it. For example, murder is considered evil because it goes against the natural order and the commandments of God.

On the other hand, wickedness often implies a persistent pattern of doing evil, or having a heart that is habitually opposed to God and His commands. A wicked person is not just someone who occasionally does wrong things, but someone who consistently chooses a path contrary to righteousness.

In the Quran, similar concepts can be found with terms like Fassad (corruption), Su' wa Shurur (evil deeds), and Khabitha (wicked). However, it is important to note that understanding these concepts requires a deep study of the Bible or Quran, as well as guidance from knowledgeable scholars.
