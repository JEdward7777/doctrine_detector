  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer, while informative about Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus, does not address the foundational aspect of faith in Christianity as outlined in the reference answer. The foundational aspect of faith in Christianity is centered on trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, which is not touched upon in the student's response. A Christian perspective on faith in Jesus emphasizes personal salvation through acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior, which the student's answer does not reflect."
