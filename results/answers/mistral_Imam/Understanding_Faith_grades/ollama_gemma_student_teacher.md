## Correct Answer
To 'have faith in Jesus' means to believe all of God's teachings about Jesus, especially trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice to cleanse them from their sin.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the foundational aspect of faith in Christianity.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Faith.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 According to Islamic teachings, Muslims believe in Jesus (known as Isa in Arabic) as a prophet of God sent to guide the children of Israel. We believe he was born miraculously by Virgin Mary (Maryam) and was raised under the care of Zachariah (Zakariya).

However, Muslim faith in Jesus differs from Christian beliefs about him. Muslims do not consider Jesus as the Son of God or God incarnate. Instead, we believe that he is a messenger of Allah who performed miracles and was given revelation through the Holy Spirit (Ruh al-Qudus).

So, to have faith in Jesus from an Islamic perspective means recognizing him as a Messenger of Allah, respecting his teachings, acknowledging his virgin birth, and praying for his intercession on the Day of Judgment. It does not include the Christian doctrines of the Trinity or Divine Incarnation.

However, it lacks the emphasis on trusting in Jesus and his sacrifice for sin, which is a key element of Christian faith. Additionally, the answer does not address the student's concern regarding understanding the foundational aspect of faith in Christianity.
