  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's response provides a detailed explanation of the term 'faithless' within an Islamic context, which demonstrates a good understanding of the topic. However, the answer does not directly address the concern of the significance of faith in one's moral conduct, as the reference answer does. The student could further improve their response by explicitly connecting the concept of being 'faithless' to the impact on moral conduct from a Christian worldview."
