  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: This response provides a solid explanation of forgiveness according to Christian teaching. It accurately highlights the importance of forgiveness in Christianity, emphasizing the need to let go of resentment and choose to pardon others as God has forgiven us. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses, such as Matthew 18:21-22 and Matthew 5:43-48, contributes to the doctrinal correctness of the answer. The explanation of forgiveness not meaning forgetting or condoning the wrongdoing but rather releasing oneself from negative emotions is also well-presented. Additionally, the student's humility in suggesting consulting with religious scholars or Christian leaders for a more detailed explanation is commendable."
