  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of forgiveness according to Christian teaching, referencing key biblical passages and emphasizing the importance of releasing anger and resentment. The answer aligns well with the teacher's reference answer, demonstrating a good understanding of the Christian concept of forgiveness. A minor deduction is made for not directly stating that forgiveness mirrors the forgiveness God offers when people confess their sins, as highlighted in the reference answer. Overall, a strong response."
