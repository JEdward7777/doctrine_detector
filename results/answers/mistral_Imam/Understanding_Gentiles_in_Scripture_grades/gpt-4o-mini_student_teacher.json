  "grade": 75.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 75.\n\nThe student has provided a comprehensive and well-thought-out response regarding the Israelites' perception of Gentiles in the early church. They have shown a clear understanding of the historical context and have referenced biblical passages to support their points. However, the student's answer is somewhat verbose and could be more focused on directly addressing the question. Additionally, the student's answer could have more explicitly highlighted the initial struggles and challenges within the early church due to the Israelites' perception of Gentiles, as indicated in the reference answer. Overall, a good effort but could benefit from more conciseness and direct engagement with the specific concern raised in the question."
