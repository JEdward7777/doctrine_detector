## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that Muslims should have knowledge and understanding of other divine revelations, including the Bible, as they provide valuable insights into the nature of God and His attributes. However, it is important to interpret these scriptures within their historical, cultural, and religious contexts.

Regarding your question about the nature of God's wrath in the Bible and how it differs from human anger, let us turn to the Bible itself for guidance. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word most often translated as "wrath" is "acher," which can also mean strong displeasure or indignation. God's wrath is not simply an expression of emotion but rather a manifestation of His righteous judgment against injustice, sin, and unrighteousness. It serves to correct, discipline, and ultimately bring people back to Him (Ezekiel 36:23).

In contrast, human anger is generally motivated by self-centered desires, such as revenge or the protection of one's own interests. Humans are prone to sin and can become consumed by anger, leading to destructive actions. The Bible teaches that true righteousness involves controlling our anger (Ephesians 4:26) and seeking to emulate God's patience, love, and mercy instead of resorting to anger or vengeance (1 Peter 3:9).

While God's wrath and human anger share some similarities in terms of being a strong response to wrongdoing, the essential difference lies in their sources, motivations, and ultimate purposes. God's wrath is an expression of His righteous character and holy nature, aimed at upholding justice, while human anger often arises from self-centered desires or a lack of understanding and trust in God.

In conclusion, the Bible teaches that God's wrath differs from human anger in its source, motivation, and ultimate purpose. While human anger can lead to destruction and division, God's wrath is an expression of His love and justice, aiming ultimately to bring people back to Him and establish a righteous world order. Muslims should strive to understand these teachings and apply them in their daily lives.
