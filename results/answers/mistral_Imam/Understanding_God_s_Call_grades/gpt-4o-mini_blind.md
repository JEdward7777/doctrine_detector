## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Call.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic understanding, the Bible (Tawrat, Injeel) is considered among the divinely revealed books sent to the Prophets of Israel. However, it should be noted that the Quran, as the final and complete revelation from Allah, provides more detailed explanations regarding some concepts that may not have been explicitly clear in previous scriptures due to distortions or loss over time.

Regarding your question about God calling us by name, it is important to consider both biblical and Islamic contexts for a comprehensive answer. In the Bible (Isaiah 43:1), it is stated that God has called His people by their names, declaring that they are His, and He has redeemed them.

In Islam, Allah (swt) knows each person intimately, and He is aware of every detail about us, including our names. In Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:78), the Quran mentions that on the Day of Judgment, we will be called by our true names, which are known to Allah (swt) alone:

> "And they will pass on from stage to stage [of judgment]. And every nation will be paid in full what it earned, and He is best aware of their deeds." (Translation by Sahih International)

This verse suggests that Allah knows us and our actions more intimately than we know ourselves. In this context, being called by name refers to the intimate relationship between the servant and the Lord, as well as the accountability for one's actions in life.

In summary, both biblical and Islamic traditions emphasize that God has an intimate knowledge of each person and their individual stories, as well as the importance of accountability for our actions. The concept of being called by name can be understood as a reminder of our unique connection with the Divine and the consequences of our choices in this life.

Grade: 60

Comments: The response provides a comprehensive comparison between the Biblical and Islamic perspectives on God calling individuals by name. However, from a Christian worldview, the answer lacks doctrinal accuracy. It is important to note that the Bible's declaration of God calling His people by name signifies a personal, intimate relationship between God and His chosen ones. The explanation should have delved deeper into the Christian understanding of God's individualized and intentional calling of believers. Additionally, not all aspects of Islamic theology align with Christian beliefs, so it's crucial to approach such comparisons with caution and clarity. The response could have improved by solely focusing on the Christian perspective without integrating elements from other faith traditions.
