  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a well-researched and articulated answer that incorporated both biblical and Islamic perspectives on the concept of being called by name. The student effectively highlighted the intimate relationship and accountability aspects of being known by God. However, the response could have focused more specifically on the Christian understanding of this concept and the personal relationship God has towards individuals, which was the specified concern. Additionally, the student could have emphasized the significance of God's personal choice and purpose for each individual as portrayed in the Bible."
