## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Call.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic understanding, the Bible (Tawrat, Injeel) is considered among the divinely revealed books sent to the Prophets of Israel. However, it should be noted that the Quran, as the final and complete revelation from Allah, provides more detailed explanations regarding some concepts that may not have been explicitly clear in previous scriptures due to distortions or loss over time.

Regarding your question about God calling us by name, it is important to consider both biblical and Islamic contexts for a comprehensive answer. In the Bible (Isaiah 43:1), it is stated that God has called His people by their names, declaring that they are His, and He has redeemed them.

In Islam, Allah (swt) knows each person intimately, and He is aware of every detail about us, including our names. In Surah Al-Waqi'ah (56:78), the Quran mentions that on the Day of Judgment, we will be called by our true names, which are known to Allah (swt) alone:

> "And they will pass on from stage to stage [of judgment]. And every nation will be paid in full what it earned, and He is best aware of their deeds." (Translation by Sahih International)

This verse suggests that Allah knows us and our actions more intimately than we know ourselves. In this context, being called by name refers to the intimate relationship between the servant and the Lord, as well as the accountability for one's actions in life.

In summary, both biblical and Islamic traditions emphasize that God has an intimate knowledge of each person and their individual stories, as well as the importance of accountability for our actions. The concept of being called by name can be understood as a reminder of our unique connection with the Divine and the consequences of our choices in this life.

Grade: 80

Comment: The student provided a well-researched and articulated answer that incorporated both biblical and Islamic perspectives on the concept of being called by name. The student effectively highlighted the intimate relationship and accountability aspects of being known by God. However, the response could have focused more specifically on the Christian understanding of this concept and the personal relationship God has towards individuals, which was the specified concern. Additionally, the student could have emphasized the significance of God's personal choice and purpose for each individual as portrayed in the Bible.
