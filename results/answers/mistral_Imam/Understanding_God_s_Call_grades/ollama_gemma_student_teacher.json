  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a thorough understanding of the biblical and Islamic perspectives on the concept of being called by name. They provide relevant passages from both scriptures to support their claims. Additionally, they acknowledge the distinction between the biblical and Islamic understandings of the Quran as the ultimate revelation. However, the answer could be improved by explicitly connecting the concept of being called by name to the idea of a personal relationship with God."
