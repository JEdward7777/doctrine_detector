  "grade_comment": "Grade: 30\n\nComment: The student's answer misses the mark in addressing the Christian perspective on being 'called' by God. While the student attempts to draw parallels between Islamic and Christian beliefs, they fail to accurately articulate the specific Christian understanding of being called by God as signifying His special purpose and work for individuals. The response lacks a clear explanation of the personal and purposeful aspect of this call within the context of faith. It is important for the student to focus on the unique Christian understanding of divine calling in future responses."
