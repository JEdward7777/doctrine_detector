It also acknowledges the shared essence of faith across religious traditions and encourages open-mindedness and mutual understanding. However, it does not fully capture the biblical understanding of being \"called\" as being chosen for a specific purpose or work by God (as stated in the answer). The response could be strengthened by further exploration of this concept in both Christian and Islamic contexts, particularly in relation to personal purpose in the context of faith."
