However, the answer primarily focuses on Islamic beliefs and interpretation of biblical texts related to Jesus, rather than addressing the specific question from a Christian worldview. It is important to assess Jesus' demonstration of favor with God and men based on Christian scripture and theology. The answer could have been improved by discussing passages from the Bible that explicitly address how Jesus demonstrated favor with God and men, such as Luke 2:52, which states that Jesus \"increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man.\" Additionally, the portrayal of Jesus solely as a Prophet in Islamic tradition does not align with Christian beliefs regarding His divine nature."
