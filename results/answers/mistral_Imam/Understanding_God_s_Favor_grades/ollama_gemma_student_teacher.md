## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Favor.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim scholar, I respectfully approach this question by referring to the Bible as mentioned in Islamic sources, such as the Taurat (Torah) and Injeel (New Testament), rather than through personal study or interpretation.

According to Islamic belief, Jesus (Prophet 'Īsā in Arabic) is considered one of the great Prophets of God and an important figure for Muslims too, even though Islam's primary sources don't include the New Testament as the Quran does with the Taurat and Injeel.

In Islamic tradition, Jesus (PBUH) demonstrated favor with God by following divine guidance, performing miracles, spreading monotheism, and serving humanity. This is reflected in several Bible verses:

1. Luke 4:18-19 (Injeel): "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord."

2. John 14:15 (Injeel): "If ye love me, keep my commandments." This verse emphasizes Jesus' obedience to God's will as a demonstration of his favor with both God and men.

3. Matthew 22:37-40 (Injeel) highlights one of the most important teachings of Jesus concerning love for God and humanity, which is also foundational in Islam: "And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."

These verses reflect Jesus' emphasis on compassion, service, and obedience to God as ways of demonstrating favor with both God and humanity in a Christian context. Muslims see these teachings as further evidence of Prophet 'Īsā's greatness and exemplary character for all people.
