## [Answer](../Understanding_God_s_Glory.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, we believe that Allah (God) is the most Glorious (Al-Jalali) and the Most Compassionate (Ar-Rahman), attributes that are unique to Him and not found in any worldly sources of glory. In the Bible, the concept of God's glory is similar, though it may be expressed differently due to cultural and linguistic differences between the two religious texts.

Worldly sources of glory often refer to temporary, earthly achievements, such as wealth, power, recognition, or beauty. They are fleeting and subject to decay, change, or loss. In contrast, the glory of God, as described in both the Bible and the Quran, is eternal, infinite, and transcendent â€“ beyond human comprehension.

In the Bible, God's glory is often portrayed as His divine presence, His character, His actions, or the manifestation of His attributes. For example, the Burning Bush in Exodus (3:2-4) and the Transfiguration of Jesus (Matthew 17:1-8) can be seen as instances where God's glory was revealed to humans.

The glory of worldly sources is generally something that humans strive for, seeking recognition and validation from others. In contrast, God's glory should inspire awe, reverence, and submission in humans. It is not something to be sought after but rather to be humbly acknowledged and worshipped.

In Islam, the concept of God's glory (Jalalah) is often paired with His mercy (Rahmah). These attributes remind us that Allah is both awe-inspiring in His majesty and merciful towards His creation. This duality teaches us to fear Allah in a manner that leads us to do good deeds out of love, respect, and gratitude for His blessings rather than out of fear alone.

In both the Bible and the Quran, the ultimate goal is not to seek glory but to emulate God's attributes by being compassionate, just, and righteous towards others. In this sense, our focus should be on striving to become closer to God and reflecting His divine qualities in our own lives rather than seeking worldly sources of glory.
