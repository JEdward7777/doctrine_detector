  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student's answer provides detailed insights on seeking God's will from a Muslim perspective, emphasizing consultation, reflection, prayer, fear of Allah, patience, and continuous learning. While the response is well-developed and offers practical suggestions for decision-making, it deviates from the Christian worldview provided in the reference answer. From a Christian perspective, seeking God's will primarily involves aligning choices with His revealed word in Scripture. The student should focus more on biblical principles and teachings in their response to better address the concern provided."
