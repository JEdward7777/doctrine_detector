  "grade": 90.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 90.\n\nThe response provides a comprehensive understanding of seeking God's will, drawing from Islamic principles and practices (Shura bi'l-Lah, consultation, reflection, prayer, etc.). It also offers practical advice for individuals to seek guidance in their daily lives. The emphasis on humility, fear of Allah, and trust in His plan aligns with the Christian concept of seeking God's will.\n\nThe response effectively addresses the concern about people struggling with making decisions that honor God or feeling uncertain about His direction. By providing a framework for decision-making and emphasizing the importance of prayer, consultation, and reflection, the response offers guidance and reassurance to those seeking to follow God's will.\n\nThe only area where the response falls short is in explicitly connecting its principles to Christian Scripture and theology. While some general references are made to \"Scripture\" and \"the divine guidance provided,\" more specific biblical examples or theological underpinnings could be added to strengthen the connection between Islamic principles and Christian faith."
