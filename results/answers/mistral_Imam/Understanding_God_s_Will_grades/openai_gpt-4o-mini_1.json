It emphasizes consulting with others, reflecting, praying, relying on scripture, and cultivating trust in Allah's plan. The guidance aligns with the Christian worldview of seeking God's desires and aligning choices with Scripture. The concern of struggle and uncertainty in decision-making is addressed through the emphasis on seeking guidance, reflection, and prayer. The only area for improvement would be to further emphasize the importance of seeking God's will through a personal relationship with Him, as Christianity emphasizes a personal connection with God through Jesus Christ."
