  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provides a well-structured and insightful response, discussing the nature of God's wrath in comparison to human anger. They incorporate relevant biblical references and emphasize the differences between the two. However, the student could improve by directly addressing the concern stated, which emphasizes that God's wrath is a measured response to sin rather than a mere emotional outburst. Additionally, while the student brings up valuable points about the motivations and purposes of God's wrath and human anger, they could have delved deeper into the Christian perspective on this topic."
