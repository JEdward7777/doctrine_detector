  "grade": 95.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this response a grade of 95.\n\nThe response largely aligns with the given answer, accurately describing God's wrath as a righteous judgment against sin, in contrast to human anger which can be sinful. The explanation of God's wrath being aimed at upholding justice and holiness is also consistent with the concern that God's wrath is not a fit of rage but a measured response to sin.\n\nThe response also provides additional insights and biblical support for its claims, using passages such as Ezekiel 36:23, Ephesians 4:26, and 1 Peter 3:9. The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points and encourages Muslims to apply these teachings in their daily lives.\n\nThe only area where the response could be improved is in providing more detailed biblical exegesis on specific passages, rather than simply referencing them. Nevertheless, the overall quality of the response is excellent, and it demonstrates a clear understanding of God's wrath as described in the Bible."
