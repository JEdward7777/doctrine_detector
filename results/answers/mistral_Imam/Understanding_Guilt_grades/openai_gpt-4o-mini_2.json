It appropriately highlights the central role of repentance and acknowledges the differences in theological beliefs between the two religions. However, the response could have further emphasized the significance of repentance and forgiveness in light of Christian teachings on salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, and how this differs from the Islamic perspective on seeking forgiveness through Tawba."
