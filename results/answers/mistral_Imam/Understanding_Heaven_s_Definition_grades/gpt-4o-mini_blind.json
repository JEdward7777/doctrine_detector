  "grade": 60.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student accurately distinguishes between the concepts of \"heaven\" and \"sky\" in Christianity and Islamic perspectives. However, there are theological inaccuracies in the explanation regarding Christian beliefs, such as the mention of \"original sin\" and the need for redemption through Jesus Christ, which are foundational doctrines in Christianity. While the student attempted to provide a comparative analysis with sensitivity, the doctrinal discrepancies lower the grade significantly."
