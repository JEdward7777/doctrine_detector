  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided an informative comparison of the concepts of \"heaven\" and \"sky\" from an Islamic perspective but failed to address the biblical definition of 'heaven' and its distinction from 'sky' as per the concern provided. The response lacked a clear Christian worldview and did not thoroughly engage with the specific differences between these terms in Christianity. Additionally, the emphasis on Islamic beliefs, while interesting from a comparative religion standpoint, did not fully address the prompt. The student should focus more on the Christian understanding of 'heaven' and 'sky' to align with the given concern."
