  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thoughtful understanding of the biblical definitions of 'heaven' and 'sky,' while also acknowledging the differences between Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding these concepts. The student provides accurate information about the general usage of both terms in Christianity, and clearly explains their more spiritual significance. The inclusion of comparative insights between Christianity and Islam adds depth to the response and demonstrates sensitivity to different cultural contexts."
