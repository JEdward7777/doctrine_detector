The focus on the theological significance of these concepts and the emphasis on sensitivity in comparative discussions are commendable. However, there is no direct reference to the concern raised about how understanding these terms can impact our relationship with God. Integrating this concern more explicitly into the response would have strengthened the analysis from a Christian worldview."
