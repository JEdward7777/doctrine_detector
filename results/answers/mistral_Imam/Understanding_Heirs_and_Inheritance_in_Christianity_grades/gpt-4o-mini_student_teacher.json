However, the response could have been improved by focusing more on the specific Christian understanding of receiving God's promises as heirs, rather than delving into the broader comparison with Islam. Additionally, the student could have delved deeper into the significance of being spiritual heirs in Christianity and how it relates to the overall identity of Christians as heirs of God's promises.
