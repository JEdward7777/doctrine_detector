  "grade_comment": "Grade: 65\n\nComment: The student provided a well-articulated explanation of the concept of God's absolute holiness in Islamic belief and its implications for our relationship with Him. However, the answer does not directly address the concern raised in the question regarding reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God from a Christian worldview. Additionally, while the student's response is informative and insightful, it lacks specific references to Christian beliefs or scriptures in addressing the question."
