## Question [Understanding Holiness](../../../questions/Understanding_Holiness.md)
What does it mean for God to be absolutely holy, and how does that affect our relationship with Him?

God's absolute holiness means He is completely set apart from sin and imperfection, which indicates that we cannot approach Him without His allowance due to our sinful nature.

## Stated Concern
This question prompts reflection on our own holiness and the necessary steps for approaching a holy God.

## [Answer](../Understanding_Holiness.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic belief, Allah (God) is Absolutely Holy (Al-Quddus), one of the 99 names or attributes of Allah. This holiness signifies perfection in all aspects. He is free from any imperfection, defect, or shortcoming. His Holiness includes purity, sanctity, majesty, and separation from everything that is base and vile.

This attribute has significant implications for our relationship with Him:

1. Purity of Worship: Since Allah is Absolutely Holy, any form of worship must be pure and sincere. This means that our intentions should always be clear, our hearts clean, and our actions in accordance with the teachings of Islam.

2. Striving for Holiness: As Muslims, we are encouraged to strive towards holiness (Ihsan) in our daily lives. By emulating Allah's attributes, we aim to purify ourselves and come closer to Him.

3. Humility: Awareness of Allah's Absolute Holiness should instill a sense of humility within us. We recognize that we are His creatures, dependent on Him for everything, and it is our duty to submit to His will.

4. Fear and Love: The awareness of Allah's Holiness can evoke both fear (Hayaa') and love (Hubb) in us. Fear of displeasing Him due to our imperfections, and love for His infinite mercy, forgiveness, and guidance.

5. Seeking Forgiveness: Since Allah is Absolutely Holy, any sin we commit separates us from Him. However, He is also Al-Ghafur (The All-Forgiving), and with sincere repentance, He can forgive our sins and bring us back into His presence.

In summary, understanding Allah's Absolute Holiness reminds us of our dependence on Him, motivates us to strive for purity in all aspects of life, and encourages humility, fear, love, and sincere repentance.
