  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student's response provides a solid understanding of humility before God in the Christian perspective by emphasizing acknowledgment of dependence on God and submission to His will. However, the student could improve by focusing more on the aspect of submitting one's will to God and recognizing His greatness, as highlighted in the reference answer. There is also a slight deviation in the response when mentioning that humility is not exclusive to Christianity, which could be construed as diluting the Christian perspective."
