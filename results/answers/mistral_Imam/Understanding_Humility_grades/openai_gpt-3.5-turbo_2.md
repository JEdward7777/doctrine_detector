## [Answer](../Understanding_Humility.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Christian perspective, humbling oneself before God is an act of recognizing one's own insignificance in comparison to the greatness of God. It involves acknowledging that we are creatures who depend on our Creator for everything, and that without Him, we can do nothing (John 15:5).

This humility is often demonstrated through prayer, repentance, and obedience to God's commandments. Jesus Christ himself provides a model of humility in the New Testament by willingly submitting to God's plan, even to the point of suffering and death on the cross (Philippians 2:5-8).

In summary, humbling oneself before God in the Christian perspective means acknowledging our dependence on Him, seeking His guidance, submitting to His will, and striving to live a life pleasing to Him. This is not exclusive to Christianity but can be found in many faith traditions as a way of drawing closer to the divine.
