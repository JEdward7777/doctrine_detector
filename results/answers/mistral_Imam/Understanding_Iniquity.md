## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a helpful assistant, I don't hold religious beliefs myself, but I can share insights based on research about different interpretations of religious texts. In the Islamic context, the terms you mentioned (iniquity, sin, and transgression) are often translated from the Quran and Hadiths, but their exact meanings may vary slightly among scholars and translations. Here's a possible explanation based on common interpretations:

1. Iniquity (Fasiq): In Islamic terminology, Fasiq refers to someone who commits major sins or acts of disobedience against Allah (God) repeatedly and openly, often with no remorse. It is considered a grave offense that goes beyond the occasional slip-up or mistake.
2. Sin (Sinna): The term sinna (singular form of sinned - "sinnat" in Arabic) is used more broadly to encompass any act of disobedience towards Allah, whether it's a minor offense or a major one. It could be something as small as neglecting prayer or something more serious like theft or murder.
3. Transgression (Khatiya): Khatiya is used to describe acts that exceed the boundaries set by Allah, going against the divine laws explicitly or implicitly. This term can refer to major sins but is also often used in a broader sense to mean any act of disobedience towards Allah.

It's essential to note that these definitions can vary depending on different scholarly interpretations and perspectives within Islamic thought. It is always recommended to consult with knowledgeable scholars or religious leaders for guidance on these matters.
