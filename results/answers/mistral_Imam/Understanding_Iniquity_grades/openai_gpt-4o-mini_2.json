However, the concern specified was regarding a Christian perspective, and while the information provided can broaden understanding, it lacks a direct application or reflection on how Christians can apply this knowledge to recognize the gravity of their actions and seek repentance from a Christian worldview. Integration of Christian teachings on sin, iniquity, and repentance would have enhanced the response further."
