## [Answer](../Understanding_Innocence.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the context of a person being wrongfully accused, the term "innocent" signifies that such a person has not committed any crime or offense for which they are accused. According to biblical teachings, as presented in the Book of Exodus (23:7), it is emphasized that one should not put an innocent person to death or wrongfully convict them, as God himself will judge them. This principle is also reflected in the New Testament, particularly in Matthew 18:6 where Jesus teaches his followers to prevent a child from falling into sin and being ensnared, which can be interpreted as protecting the innocence of others. Additionally, in Isaiah 59:14, it is stated that righteousness will protect those who fear God, and He will protect their paths; but those who respect evil will be eliminated by it. This implies that the innocent are protected by a higher power and should not be wronged by human actions.
