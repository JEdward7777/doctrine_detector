While they acknowledged the Holy Spirit's guidance and empowerment, they could have elaborated more on the Holy Spirit's specific role in intercession according to the biblical teaching. It would have been beneficial for them to delve deeper into the scriptural references that emphasize the Holy Spirit's intercessory role."
