The explanation acknowledges that while the primary role of intercession is often attributed to Jesus Christ and human prayers, there are also instances where the Holy Spirit is seen as interceding for believers. It could be improved by further highlighting the specific ways in which the Holy Spirit intercedes in prayer. Overall, a well-informed and thoughtful response."
