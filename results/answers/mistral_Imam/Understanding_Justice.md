## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islam, acting justly (or righteously) is an essential aspect of a believer's life. It is known as "Al-'Adl" in Arabic. To act justly according to God's laws means adhering to the principles set out by Allah (God) and His Messenger, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). These principles are embodied in the Quran and the Sunnah (the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad).

1. **Fulfilling God's commands:** This includes the five pillars of Islam: faith, prayer, fasting, giving zakat (charity), and performing Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) if one is able. Each of these acts brings us closer to Allah and helps create a just society by fostering values such as piety, humility, compassion, and self-discipline.

2. **Treating all people with kindness and fairness:** Islam emphasizes the importance of respecting human dignity and promoting justice for all, regardless of race, ethnicity, or social status. It is important to treat others as one would like to be treated (as mentioned in the Hadith: "Not one of you will believe until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself").

3. **Ensuring fairness and justice in dealings:** Muslims are encouraged to be honest, sincere, and reliable in their interactions with others. This includes being truthful in speech, fair in business transactions, and upholding trust and integrity in all aspects of life.

4. **Speaking the truth and standing up for justice:** Islam encourages believers to speak out against oppression and injustice and to defend the rights of the weak and marginalized. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "The one who relieves a Muslim of some of his distress will not suffer any distress on the Day of Resurrection."

5. **Seeking knowledge and striving for continuous improvement:** Islam places great emphasis on learning and self-improvement. Muslims are encouraged to seek knowledge, reflect upon their actions, and strive to better themselves and those around them.
