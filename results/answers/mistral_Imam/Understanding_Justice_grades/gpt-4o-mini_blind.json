However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that the understanding of justice and righteousness in Islam is different from that in Christianity. While the principles of fairness, kindness, and integrity mentioned align with Christian values, the theological foundation of God's justice and righteousness in Christianity, particularly through the atoning work of Jesus Christ, is not addressed in this response. It would be beneficial for the student to delve deeper into the distinct Christian perspective on justice and righteousness from a doctrinal standpoint."
