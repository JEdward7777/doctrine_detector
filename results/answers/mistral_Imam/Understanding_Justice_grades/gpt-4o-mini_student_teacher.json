  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive and well-explained answer from an Islamic perspective on acting justly. While their response focused on Islamic beliefs and practices, it did not directly address the specific concern raised about understanding the biblical standard of fairness and righteousness in interactions with others according to God's laws. The student's answer lacked a direct comparison or application to the Christian worldview, which is essential for fully addressing the concern provided."
