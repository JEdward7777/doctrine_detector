It addresses the concern by emphasizing the role of lamentation in processing emotions and drawing closer to God, which could resonate with Christians struggling to express their sorrows and regrets within a faith context. The only area for improvement would be to include a mention of Jesus as the ultimate source of forgiveness and comfort in Christianity, to provide a more specific perspective from a Christian worldview."
