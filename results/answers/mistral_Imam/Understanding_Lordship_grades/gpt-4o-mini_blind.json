  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the term \"Lord\" in relation to God and Jesus according to the Bible. It accurately describes the significance of the title \"Lord\" in addressing both God and Jesus, highlighting their roles and authority. The student also effectively contrasts the Christian view with the Islamic perspective on the divinity of Jesus. However, the response could have delved deeper into the theological significance of Jesus as Lord within the Christian faith, emphasizing his role as Savior and Redeemer. Additionally, incorporating scriptural references to support the points made would have strengthened the answer."
