 In Islam, the term 'majesty' (Arabic: JalƒÅl) signifies one of the fundamental attributes of Allah (God). The concept of majesty refers to Allah's transcendent and awe-inspiring nature, emphasizing His supreme power, absolute sovereignty, and His ability to inspire fear and reverence in all creation.

The attribute of majesty reminds Muslims of the immense disparity between the divine and the human, encouraging humility and submission (Islam) before Allah. It highlights that Allah is free from any physical or metaphysical limitations and is independent of the universe, which He created out of nothingness.

The concept of majesty serves as a reminder of Allah's omnipotence and omniscience, emphasizing His ability to bring about all things in perfect order without being affected by them. It is a call to recognize the divine majesty that pervades every aspect of existence and encourages believers to seek guidance from Allah and strive for righteousness in their lives.

In summary, the term 'majesty' in relation to God's character signifies His power, transcendence, and absolute sovereignty over creation, inspiring reverence, awe, and humility among believers.
