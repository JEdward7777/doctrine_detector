However, from a Christian perspective, there are theological differences that should be addressed. The answer should have clearly stated that Muslims and Christians have different understandings of God's nature, particularly in terms of the Trinity and the divinity of Jesus Christ. Additionally, the answer could have highlighted the Christian view of God's majesty in relation to His holiness, righteousness, and perfect love. It would have been beneficial to include Scriptural references to support the Christian understanding of God's majesty."
