  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of the term 'majesty' in Islam, highlighting Allah's attributes and emphasizing the disparity between the divine and the human. However, the answer did not directly address the concern of understanding God's attributes and His sovereignty over creation from a Christian perspective. The response focused solely on Islamic beliefs rather than incorporating a Christian-specific worldview, therefore leading to a lower grade. A more accurate answer would have connected the term 'majesty' to Christian beliefs about God's sovereignty and kingship over creation."
