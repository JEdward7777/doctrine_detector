  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The response provides some insight into the attribute of majesty in relation to God's character, acknowledging His greatness and sovereignty over creation. However, it lacks depth and specificity compared to the provided answer. The original response delves deeper into the Islamic concept of majesty, exploring its implications for believers' understanding of Allah's attributes, such as transcendence, omnipotence, and omniscience. While the graded response touches on these themes, it does not fully capture the richness of the attribute of majesty in Islam. To improve, the response could provide more detailed explanations and biblical connections to further reinforce the concept of God's majesty."
