  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the concept of spiritual perishing in Christian theology, emphasizing the idea of being lost or separated from God due to a lack of faith in Jesus for salvation. The student effectively addresses the concern about exploring the implications of spiritual separation from God within a Christian worldview. The response could be strengthened by providing additional scriptural references or theological insights to support the explanation further. Overall, a well-written and insightful response."
