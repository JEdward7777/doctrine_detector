  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of the concept of spiritual perishing as being lost or separated from God due to refusal to trust in Jesus for salvation, which aligns well with a Christian worldview. The explanation is supported with relevant biblical references. The response shows an understanding of the implications of spiritual separation from God within the Christian faith. The only improvement could be further elaboration on how this separation impacts individuals in their relationship with God in terms of eternal consequences."
