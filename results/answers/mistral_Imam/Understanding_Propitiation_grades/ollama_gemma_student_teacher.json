  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 80/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's response demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Christian concept of propitiation and its significance in relation to Jesus' sacrifice. It clearly explains that Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and appeases His wrath. Additionally, the student acknowledges the absence of a similar concept in Islam, providing relevant information about Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit explanation of how Jesus' sacrifice satisfies God's justice and mercy within the Christian worldview."
