The points raised effectively demonstrate how the idea of the remnant aligns with the Christian worldview of faithful endurance and God's grace extended to those who remain true to Him. The explanation is clear, insightful, and relevant to the given concern. Great job in connecting the Christian concept with the context of Muslim communities in a thoughtful and respectful manner."
