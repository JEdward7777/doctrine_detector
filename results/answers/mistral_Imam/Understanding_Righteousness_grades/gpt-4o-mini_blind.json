However, the answer does not align with a Christian worldview, as it does not acknowledge the Christian understanding of righteousness in terms of Jesus Christ being the embodiment of God's righteousness and how believers are justified through faith in Him. Additionally, the emphasis on God's mercy and compassion in Islam needs to be contrasted with the Christian view that God's righteousness also includes His perfect holiness and the necessity of Jesus' atoning sacrifice for mankind's sin. The answer would benefit from incorporating key differences between Islamic and Christian understandings of God's righteousness."
