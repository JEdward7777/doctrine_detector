  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70. The student provides a thorough explanation of what it means for God to be described as 'righteous' from an Islamic perspective. The response emphasizes attributes such as fairness, consistency, benevolence, justice, moral purity, and guidance towards righteousness. It also covers important aspects related to God's righteousness in Islamic theology.\n\nHowever, the answer does not align completely with the Christian worldview provided in the reference answer. In a Christian specific worldview, God's righteousness extends beyond justice, fairness, and moral integrity to also include absolute goodness, faithfulness, and love, which leads to the necessary condemnation of sin. While the student's response is insightful and well-explained, it lacks the emphasis on the condemnation of sin as a crucial aspect of God's righteousness in the Christian context."
