## [Answer](../Understanding_Righteousness.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic theology, when God is described as "Righteous" (Al-Adl in Arabic), it means that He embodies the highest form of justice, fairness, and moral integrity. This attribute implies several important aspects:

1. Fairness: God always acts justly and treats all His creations fairly. He does not show favoritism or partiality.

2. Consistency: God's laws are consistent and apply to everyone equally, without any exception. There is no injustice or unfairness in the way God governs the universe.

3. Beneficent: Being righteous also means that God is all-merciful (Ar-Rahman) and all-compassionate (Ar-Raheem), showing infinite kindness, love, and benevolence towards His creatures.

4. Just Ruler: As the Righteous Judge, God's decisions are always just and based on perfect knowledge, wisdom, and justice. He never errs or makes a mistake in His rulings.

5. Morally Pure: God is pure from any imperfection or deficiency, and righteousness is one of the qualities that embodies His perfection. He is untainted by any wrongdoing or sin.

6. The Guide to Righteousness: Lastly, being Righteous means that God sets the standard for what is righteous and virtuous in all aspects of life. As Muslims, we strive to emulate His characteristics and traits in our daily lives.

In summary, when God is described as "Righteous," it emphasizes His inherent fairness, justice, consistency, benevolence, perfect judgment, moral purity, and role as the guide towards righteousness for humanity.
