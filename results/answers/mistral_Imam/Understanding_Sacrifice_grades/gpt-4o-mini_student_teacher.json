  "grade": 50.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the student provided a thorough explanation of the differences between Islamic and Christian perspectives on Jesus and sacrificial symbolism, the answer did not directly address the Christian understanding of why Jesus is referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament. The student accurately described the symbolic significance of lambs in Old Testament sacrifices in both faith traditions, but did not explicitly connect this to the Christian belief in Jesus as the perfect and unblemished sacrifice for sins. The grade reflects the acknowledgment of relevant information provided by the student, but also the lack of alignment with the specific concern of the question from a Christian perspective."
