# Question [Understanding Sacrifice](../../../questions/Understanding_Sacrifice.md)
Why is Jesus referred to as the 'Lamb of God' in relation to the sacrifices commanded in the Old Testament?

Jesus is called the 'Lamb of God' because he was a perfect and unblemished sacrifice who paid for people's sins, analogous to the sacrifices of perfect lambs commanded in the Old Testament.

# Stated Concern
This question aims to help Christians understand the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption.

# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim scholar, I would like to clarify that my knowledge and perspective are rooted in Islamic teachings. In Islam, Prophet Isa (Jesus) is considered one of the important prophets sent by Allah (God). However, our understanding of Jesus' role as the "Lamb of God" differs significantly from Christian theology due to differing beliefs about his nature and crucifixion.

In the Old Testament, the term "lamb" is often used metaphorically to represent a sin offering or sacrifice. The Israelites were commanded to offer lambs as part of their religious practices (e.g., Leviticus 1:4, 3:7). This symbolizes the shedding of blood and the removal of sins through God's mercy and forgiveness.

In Christian tradition, Jesus is referred to as the "Lamb of God" as part of a spiritual allegory. Christians believe that through his crucifixion and subsequent resurrection, Jesus fulfilled the role of the sacrificial lamb, offering salvation from sin. This understanding is not shared in Islam because Muslims do not accept that Prophet Isa was crucified or that he died for humanity's sins. Instead, we believe that God forgives sins upon repentance and faith in Him.

In summary, the concept of Jesus as the "Lamb of God" in Christian theology signifies his role as the sacrificial offering that took away the sins of humankind through his crucifixion and resurrection. In Islam, we revere Prophet Isa as a prophet who did not die on the cross but was raised to Heaven by Allah (God).

Grade: 30

Comment: The response provided by the Muslim scholar accurately explains the differing views between Christianity and Islam regarding the concept of Jesus as the "Lamb of God." However, the perspective presented aligns more closely with Islamic beliefs rather than the Christian concern of understanding the significance of Jesus' sacrificial role in fulfilling God's plan for redemption. From a Christian worldview, the response does not address the core theological understanding of Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb who atones for the sins of humanity.
