It also acknowledges the nuances within Christian interpretations of Satan. However, it does not explicitly address how knowing the meaning of Satan's name helps Christians understand his role in spiritual warfare, which is the concern specified. To improve, the response could more directly connect the meaning of Satan's name to his role as an adversary and tempter in spiritual warfare."
