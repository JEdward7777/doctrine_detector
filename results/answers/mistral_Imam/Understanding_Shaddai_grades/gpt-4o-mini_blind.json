However, it lacks depth in exploring the theological implications of 'Shaddai' within the Christian worldview, particularly regarding God's attributes of power, provision, and protection. Additionally, framing the response with a neutral perspective may undermine the significance that 'Shaddai' holds within Christian theology. A more robust explanation of how 'Shaddai' reflects God's character and relationship with His people would enhance the theological depth of the answer."
