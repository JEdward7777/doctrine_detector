They touched on the debated meanings of the term and its significance as a name for God used by the patriarchs. However, the student could have delved deeper into how 'Shaddai' reveals the nature and attributes of God as the teacher's reference answer did. This answer lacked a clear connection to the attributes of God as revealed in Scripture."
