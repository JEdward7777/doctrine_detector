However, there is room for improvement in connecting the use of 'Shaddai' to a deeper understanding of the nature and attributes of God as revealed in Scripture. A more explicit discussion on how the term 'Shaddai' reflects God's character and sovereignty, as well as its significance in portraying God as the Almighty, could enhance the response further from a Christian worldview perspective."
