 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or practices, but I can provide you with information about various religious texts and terms from a neutral perspective. In this case, you asked about the Hebrew term 'Shaddai' in the context of the Old Testament, which is part of the Christian Bible and the Jewish Tanakh.

The term 'Shaddai' appears in the Old Testament (Genesis 17:1, 28:3; Exodus 6:2-3) and is one of the names for God used by the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The exact meaning of Shaddai has been debated among scholars. However, it's generally understood to denote a powerful God who provides or protects His people.

The root of 'Shaddai' (שדי) is found in the Hebrew verb שדד (shadad), which means "to be almighty" or "to destroy." Another interpretation suggests that Shaddai may be derived from shad (breast) and ayin (eye), indicating a provider or nourisher.

In the Old Testament, 'Shaddai' is often used in contexts where God is seen as a mighty protector and a source of blessing for His chosen people. For example, when God appears to Hagar, He says, "I will multiply your offspring like the stars of heaven and will assign to them all these lands; and through your offspring all nations of the earth shall bless themselves" (Genesis 26:4). This demonstrates one aspect of 'Shaddai' as a provider and protector.
