The additional insights into the root of the word and its usage in Scripture enhance the understanding of God's attributes as revealed in the Hebrew text. However, the response could have further emphasized God's identity as the Almighty and how this attribute reflects His sovereignty and power in a more explicit manner based on a Christian worldview."
