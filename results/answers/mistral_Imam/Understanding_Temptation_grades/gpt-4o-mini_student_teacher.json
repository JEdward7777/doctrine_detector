  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a thorough and respectful analysis of Prophet Jesus' encounter with Satan from an Islamic perspective. They highlighted key strategies such as faith, patience, reliance on Allah, understanding the nature of temptation, and recognizing the true source of power. However, the student's response did not directly address the specific strategies of using scripture and unwavering faith in God, as mentioned in the reference answer. While the student's response enhances understanding from an Islamic viewpoint, a more direct connection to the Christian perspective, emphasizing scripture and faith in God, would have strengthened the response further."
