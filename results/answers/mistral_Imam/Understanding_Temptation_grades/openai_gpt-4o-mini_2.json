While the strategies derived from Prophet Jesus' response align with Christian principles of faith, patience, reliance on God, understanding of worldly temptations, and recognition of true power, the discussion lacks direct reference to the teachings of Jesus as found in the New Testament. While valuable insights are offered, a more explicit connection to Christian beliefs and practices could enhance the relevance to combating temptation as a follower of Christ."
