  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has provided a solid explanation of the term \"transgress\" in a Biblical context, relating it to breaking God's laws or commandments. They correctly highlight the concept of disobedience and the consequences of transgression. However, the inclusion of Islamic teachings in the explanation, while interesting, deviates slightly from the Christian-specific worldview focus in addressing the concern. Adjusting the answer to solely focus on the Christian perspective would have resulted in a higher grade."
