  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provided a generally accurate description of the concepts of sin and trespass in a Christian context. However, the response lacked depth and failed to clearly articulate the essential relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God, as outlined in the concern. It would have been beneficial for the student to focus more on how trespass specifically relates to sin against God in Christian ethics. Additionally, the comparison to Islam, while informative, was somewhat tangential to the main question."
