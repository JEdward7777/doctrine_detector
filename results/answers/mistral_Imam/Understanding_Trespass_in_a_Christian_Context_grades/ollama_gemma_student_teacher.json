  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** This is a well-researched and insightful response that clearly explains the relationship between trespass and sin in a Christian worldview. The student demonstrates a deep understanding of the concept of sin as a violation of God's law and provides a clear analogy between physical trespassing and moral violations such as lying. The inclusion of references to Islamic teachings adds an additional dimension to the comparison and highlights the universal moral principles shared across different faiths."
