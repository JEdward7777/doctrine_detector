The example provided, such as lying being a trespass against truth and honesty, is also well-represented. However, the response could have gone further in exploring the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God. While it mentions that all sins are considered trespasses against God, it would be more comprehensive to explicitly discuss how Christian ethics understand the interconnectedness of human relationships and morality as reflected in God's laws.\n\nThe concern is partially addressed by highlighting the concept of trespass as a violation not only of human relationships but also of God's moral laws. However, further development of this idea would strengthen the response's connection to the concern about clarifying the relationship between interpersonal violations and sin against God."
