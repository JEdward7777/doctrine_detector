  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would give this student's answer a grade of 70.\n\nWhile the student provided a thorough explanation of characteristics of an \"unholy\" life from an Islamic perspective, they did not directly address the concern of self-examination and awareness in identifying these characteristics within oneself or society. Furthermore, the answer focused solely on Islamic beliefs and teachings without explicitly referencing a Christian worldview or perspective. It is important for the student to consider the specified concern and ensure that their response aligns more closely with a Christian-specific worldview in future answers."
