  "grade_comment": "The answer provided accurately explains the term \"woe\" in the biblical context, citing relevant examples and demonstrating an understanding of the concept of impending judgment. However, the inclusion of the explanation from a Muslim context, while informative, deviates from the focus of the question, which is specifically on the biblical understanding of \"woe.\" As a result, the answer lacks doctrinal correctness as it strays into a different religious perspective.\n\nGrade: 70\n\nComment: The response effectively addresses the biblical concept of \"woe,\" but the inclusion of a perspective from Islam detracts from the doctrinal purity required in a Christian-specific worldview analysis. The explanation could be improved by maintaining a purely biblical focus."
