  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of the term \"woe\" in the context of biblical warnings and judgments, drawing from relevant Old Testament scriptures. The response effectively conveys the idea of impending judgment for sins or transgressions against God. However, there was a slight mistake in acknowledging that the answer was from a Muslim context rather than a Christian one, which is the worldview specified in the concern. Overall, the student demonstrated a solid understanding of the implications of biblical warnings related to sin and judgment, but the reference to a different religious context resulted in a lower grade."
