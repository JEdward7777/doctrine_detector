  "grade_comment": "I'd give this response a grade of 60.\n\nWhile the response does touch on the idea that \"woe\" is often used to express strong condemnation or impending judgment, it doesn't fully engage with the biblical context and implications. The answer is also heavily focused on Islamic texts and traditions, which wasn't part of the original concern.\n\nThe comment I would give is: \"While you provided some relevant information about the use of 'woe' in a prophetic sense, your response didn't adequately address the specific concern of understanding biblical warnings related to sin and judgment. Additionally, the introduction of Islamic texts and traditions took away from the main focus on biblical context. To improve, try to stay more focused on the original concern and provide more biblical examples and analysis.\""
