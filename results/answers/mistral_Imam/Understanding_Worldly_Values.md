## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the context of Christian teachings, the term "worldly" often refers to behaviors, values, or attachments that are focused primarily on temporal, earthly matters, rather than spiritual or eternal ones. This can include a preoccupation with material possessions, wealth, status, power, or sensual pleasures at the expense of God and one's relationship with Him.

Jesus Christ is reported to have said in the Bible (Matthew 6:34), "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothes?" This verse suggests that over-emphasizing worldly concerns can distract from focusing on spiritual matters, which are considered of greater importance in Christian teachings.

However, it's important to note that this does not mean that Christians should completely reject or ignore worldly affairs. Instead, they are encouraged to seek God's guidance and wisdom in navigating them. In the Book of Proverbs (3:9), it is written, "Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops; then your barns will be filled to capacity, and your vats will overflow with new wine." This suggests that using one's worldly resources in a way that honors God can lead to prosperity.

In summary, being "worldly" according to Christian teachings implies an excessive focus on earthly matters at the expense of spiritual ones, but it does not necessarily mean rejection of worldly affairs altogether. Rather, Christians are encouraged to manage their worldly resources in a way that honors God and aligns with His will.
