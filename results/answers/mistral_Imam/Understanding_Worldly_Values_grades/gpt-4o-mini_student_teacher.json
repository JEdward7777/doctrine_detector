  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student has provided a well-defined explanation regarding the term \"worldly\" in the context of Christian teachings, emphasizing the focus on temporal matters over spiritual ones. However, the student's answer lacks a clear distinction between worldly values and behaviors as inherently evil versus the potential for worldly resources to be used in a way that aligns with God's will, as mentioned in the reference answer. The concern of understanding the contrast between worldly values and godly principles could have been addressed more directly with a clearer emphasis on the negative connotations associated with worldly behaviors in Christian teachings."
