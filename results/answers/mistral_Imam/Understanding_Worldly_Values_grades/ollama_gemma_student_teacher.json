  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 80/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concept of \"worldly\" according to Christian teachings. It effectively explains the focus on earthly matters at the expense of spiritual ones, referencing relevant biblical passages. However, the answer could benefit from further elaboration on the idea of balancing worldly concerns with spiritual values. Additionally, the conclusion could have explicitly linked the concept of worldly values with the teacher's reference answer."
