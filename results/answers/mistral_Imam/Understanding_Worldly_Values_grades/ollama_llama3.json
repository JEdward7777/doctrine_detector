The main issue is that the provided definition of \"worldly\" is overly broad and does not accurately reflect the Christian teaching on the topic.\n\nWhile the response mentions Jesus' warning against worrying about earthly concerns, it does not adequately explore the distinction between a legitimate focus on temporal matters and an excessive preoccupation with them. Additionally, the discussion of honoring God with one's wealth and resources is important, but it could be further developed to demonstrate how this contrasts with worldly values.\n\nTo better address the concern, the response could have explored more explicitly how Christian teachings distinguish between godly principles (e.g., humility, generosity) and worldly values (e.g., pride, greed), highlighting the ways in which a focus on spiritual matters can lead to a more balanced approach to life. As it stands, the response provides some useful biblical references but does not fully flesh out the contrast between worldly values and godly principles."
