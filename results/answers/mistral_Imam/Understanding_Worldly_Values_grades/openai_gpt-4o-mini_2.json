  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a comprehensive explanation of the term \"worldly\" in Christian teachings, emphasizing the focus on earthly matters over spiritual ones. The inclusion of relevant Bible verses supports the argument effectively. However, the response could have improved by directly addressing the contrast between worldly values (selfishness, corruption, ungodliness) and godly principles to provide a more explicit comparison. Overall, a strong understanding and application of Christian principles are demonstrated in the response."
