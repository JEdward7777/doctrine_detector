  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive explanation of worship in Islam, outlining the concept of Ibada and the Five Pillars of Islam. They emphasized the importance of intention in worship and the broader scope of acts that can be considered worship in Islam. The answer reflects a good understanding of the topic from an Islamic perspective. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to note that worship in Christianity is primarily focused on honoring and glorifying God through reverence, adoration, praise, and thanksgiving, often expressed through prayer, singing hymns, and participating in sacraments. It would have been beneficial for the student to discuss the distinctiveness of worship in Islam compared to that in Christianity for a more well-rounded answer."
