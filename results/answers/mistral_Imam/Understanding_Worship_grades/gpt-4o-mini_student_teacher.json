  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed explanation of worship in Islam, emphasizing submission to Allah and various practices such as the Five Pillars of Islam. However, the student did not address the Christian perspective on worship, which was the specified concern. To improve the grade, the student should have connected their explanation to the Christian understanding of worship, highlighting the differences and similarities between the two faiths in relation to worship."
