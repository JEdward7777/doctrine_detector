## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As an assistant, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences, but I can help explain the Islamic perspective based on the teachings of the Quran and Hadith. The phrase 'I am Yahweh' is not directly mentioned in the Quran, but it refers to God (Allah) as He is known in the Hebrew Bible.

In the context of commands and promises, this statement emphasizes Allah's absolute authority, power, wisdom, and mercy. Allah's commands are not arbitrary or whimsical; they are based on His infinite knowledge and perfect wisdom for the greater good and ultimate happiness of His creation. Therefore, observing His commands is a means to attain peace, prosperity, and eternal salvation in this life and the hereafter.

Promises made by Allah are absolute and certain because He is the All-Knowing, All-Powerful, and All-Wise. He never breaks His promises, and those who place their trust in Him will find security and peace. The Quran states: "Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will surely grant them succession [to (their) authority] upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them; and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He has approved for them, and that He will surely replace their fear with security, they shall worship Me without any partner. But whoever disbelieves after that â€“ his refusal will be injustice from him" (Quran 24:55).

In summary, the statement 'I am Yahweh' reveals Allah's absolute power, wisdom, and mercy, which are reflected in His commands and promises. Believers are encouraged to submit themselves fully to Him and trust in His promise for guidance and success in this life and the hereafter.
