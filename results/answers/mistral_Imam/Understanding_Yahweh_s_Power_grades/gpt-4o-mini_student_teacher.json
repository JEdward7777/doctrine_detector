  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a well-explained perspective on Allah based on Islamic teachings, but the answer did not address the concern of understanding God's authority and the implications of His commands from a Christian worldview. The student should have focused on Yahweh specifically, as mentioned in the question and reference answer. Additionally, the student did not address the concept of promises and commands in the context of God's authority and sovereignty, as the concern required."
