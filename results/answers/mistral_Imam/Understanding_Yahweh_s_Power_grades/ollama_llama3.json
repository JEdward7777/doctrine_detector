The passage effectively uses Quranic verses to support its claims, providing specific examples from the Quran (Quran 24:55) that demonstrate God's authority and promise-keeping nature.\n\nThe response also does an excellent job of illustrating how these attributes are reflected in Allah's commands and promises, emphasizing the importance of submission and trust in Him. The only area for improvement is that the response could delve deeper into the implications of Allah's authority and the consequences of disobeying His commands, as this was a specific concern.\n\nTo reach a score of 100, the response would need to provide more explicit connections between the attributes mentioned (absolute power, wisdom, mercy) and the believer's life, exploring how these attributes impact daily choices and actions."
