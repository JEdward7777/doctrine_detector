## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, the term "Daughter of Zion" (بنت سِوْرية / Bent Sūriyah) is often used in references to Maryam (Mary), the mother of Prophet Isa (Jesus). This term is not explicitly associated with the Israelites or the People of Israel as a whole.

However, in a broader context, Muslims believe that the prophets and significant figures in Jewish history like Musa (Moses) and 'Isa (Jesus) are part of a continuous line of prophets from Adam to Muhammad (peace be upon them all). These prophets were sent to guide humanity towards the right path, with each one building on the teachings of their predecessors. The People of Israel, or Bani Isra'il, play a significant role in Islamic history and belief as they were chosen by Allah to receive revelations from several prophets, including Musa and 'Isa.

So, while the term "Daughter of Zion" is not directly associated with the people of Israel in the way some might understand, it does serve as a reminder of their unique role in Islamic history and their continued place in Muslim teachings about the prophets and messengers sent by Allah.
