However, it does not fully address the concern about understanding the metaphorical language used in Scripture and its implications for God's relationship with His people from a Christian perspective. The response could be improved by discussing the Christian understanding of the term as it relates to God's affection and care for the people of Israel within the context of the Bible and Christ's redemption."
