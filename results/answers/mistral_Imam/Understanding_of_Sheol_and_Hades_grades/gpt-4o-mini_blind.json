  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: This response provides a comprehensive comparison between Sheol and Hades in the context of the Bible, addressing their similarities and differences regarding the afterlife of the righteous and unrighteous. The student effectively explains the interpretations of Sheol and Hades in both Hebrew and Greek contexts, referencing relevant biblical passages such as the parable of Lazarus and the Rich Man. The integration of Islamic beliefs on the afterlife adds breadth to the discussion. However, to enhance doctrinal correctness, the explanation of Sheol having compartments for the righteous and wicked needs a clearer distinction that aligns more closely with Christian theology. Additionally, mentioning the resurrection and final judgment as key aspects of Christian eschatology could further strengthen the response."
