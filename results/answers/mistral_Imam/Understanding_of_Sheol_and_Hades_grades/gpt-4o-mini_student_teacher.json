  "grade": 80.0,
  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concepts of Sheol and Hades in the Bible and has provided a comprehensive comparison between the two. They have also highlighted the distinction between the fates of the righteous and the unrighteous in both Sheol and Hades. The student's inclusion of the Islamic perspective on the afterlife adds depth to the discussion. However, there are some minor inaccuracies and lack of depth in the explanation compared to the reference answer provided by the teacher, which prevents a higher grade."
