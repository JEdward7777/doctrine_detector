  "grade_comment": "Grade: 90\n\nComment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the distinctions between Sheol and Hades in relation to the fates of the righteous and unrighteous after death, aligning well with the concern provided. It effectively contrasts the evolution of beliefs regarding these concepts in the biblical context and presents a clear understanding of the shift towards associating Hades with the unrighteous in the New Testament. The response also briefly touches on the Islamic perspective on the afterlife for additional context. Overall, the analysis is detailed and offers a comprehensive comparison within a Christian worldview."
