However, the answer does not address the specific role of Jesus Christ as the 'cornerstone' in the Assembly of believers within a Christian context. Additionally, it lacks engagement with the significance of Jesus as the foundation of the Church and fails to emphasize the doctrinal importance of Jesus as the Son of God in Christianity. The response could be improved by focusing on the doctrinal differences related to Jesus as the 'cornerstone' in Christian theology."
