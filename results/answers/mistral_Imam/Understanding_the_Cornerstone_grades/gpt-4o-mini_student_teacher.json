  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The student's answer demonstrates a good understanding of Islamic teachings about Jesus Christ, but it does not directly address the significance of Christ as the 'cornerstone' in the context of the Assembly of believers. The response focuses more on comparing Islamic and Christian beliefs about Jesus rather than specifically discussing his role within the Assembly. In order to receive a higher grade, the student should have connected their discussion to the specified concern and the reference answer provided by highlighting how understanding Christ's role as the 'cornerstone' impacts a believer's faith and community involvement."
