## Question [Understanding the Cornerstone](../../../questions/Understanding_the_Cornerstone.md)
What role does Jesus Christ play as the 'cornerstone' in the context of the Assembly of believers?

## Correct Answer
Jesus Christ serves as the foundational support for the Assembly, determining its strength and stability.

## Stated Concern
Understanding the significance of Christ's role in the church can impact a believer's faith and community involvement.

## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Cornerstone.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic teachings, we respect and revere Jesus Christ (peace be upon him) as one of the greatest prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity. However, our understanding of his role differs significantly from Christian beliefs due to certain fundamental differences in our respective scriptures.

In the Qur'an, there is no mention of Jesus Christ as the 'cornerstone' specifically within the context of the Assembly (Ummah) of believers. Instead, we find descriptions of the virtues and miracles attributed to Jesus Christ that serve as a model for all Muslims to follow in terms of piety, humility, and submission to Allah.

The concept of Jesus Christ as a 'cornerstone' might be more closely associated with Christian theology, where he is considered the foundation upon which the Church is built (Matthew 21:42). In contrast, in Islamic thought, Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) serves as the final messenger and the seal of all prophets, with his mission encompassing all people and times.

It is essential to remember that while both traditions share a common Abrahamic heritage, there are significant differences in our beliefs about Jesus Christ and his role within each faith. Muslims respect Jesus Christ as one of Allah's messengers but do not believe in his crucifixion or divinity. We view him as a human being who was granted miraculous abilities by Allah and who, like all prophets, called his people to worship the One True God.

Ultimately, the 'Assembly of believers' refers to the global community of Muslims who strive to follow the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the sayings and actions) of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). By emulating Jesus Christ's virtues and other prophets, we aim to live a life that brings us closer to Allah.
