However, it does not directly address the concern raised about how understanding the significance of Christ's role in the church can impact a believer's faith and community involvement from a Christian worldview. In the context of the concern, the response lacks engagement with the idea that accepting Jesus Christ as the foundational support for the Assembly can profoundly shape a believer's faith and active participation within their community."
