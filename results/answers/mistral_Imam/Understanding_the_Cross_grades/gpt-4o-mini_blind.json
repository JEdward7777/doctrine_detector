However, there are some inaccuracies and lack of depth in explaining the theological significance of the crucifixion. The inclusion of Islamic beliefs about Jesus adds context but could be more clearly distinguished from Christian beliefs. More detailed explanation and scriptural references would improve the answer's depth and accuracy."
