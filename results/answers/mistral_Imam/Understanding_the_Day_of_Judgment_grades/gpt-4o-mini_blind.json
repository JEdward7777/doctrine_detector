The explanation is clear and informative. However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to highlight the doctrinal differences between Islamic beliefs about Jesus's role on the Day of Judgment and Christian beliefs. The Christian perspective would emphasize that Jesus Christ is appointed as the judge on the Day of Judgment not due to prophethood or guidance but by virtue of His divinity as the Son of God. Additionally, Jesus's role as judge is not secondary to Allah but stems from His position as the second person of the Trinity. Therefore, while the student's response is well-informed within the context of Islamic theology, it would benefit from incorporating a Christian perspective on the significance of Jesus being appointed as the judge on the Day of Judgment."
