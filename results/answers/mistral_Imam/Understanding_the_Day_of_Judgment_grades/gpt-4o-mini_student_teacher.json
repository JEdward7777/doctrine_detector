  "grade": 70.0,
  "grade_comment": "I would grade the student's answer a 70. \n\nWhile the student provides a detailed explanation of the Islamic perspective on Jesus Christ's role on the Day of Judgment and cites relevant Hadiths and Quranic verses, the response does not address the significance of Jesus Christ's sinlessness and divine nature in relation to His role as judge as stated in the reference answer from the teacher with a Christian specific worldview. The focus should have been on the core belief that Jesus, being fully God and fully man, is uniquely qualified to judge humanity. Additionally, while the student's explanation of Islamic beliefs is thorough, it strays from the Christian perspective highlighted in the reference answer."
