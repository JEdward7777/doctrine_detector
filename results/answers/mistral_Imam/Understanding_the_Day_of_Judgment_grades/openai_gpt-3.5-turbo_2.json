It acknowledges his presence as a judge in Islamic belief, albeit not as the ultimate judge like Allah. The response could have further emphasized the unique Christian belief in Jesus as the judge based on His sinlessness and divinity, contrasting it with the Islamic perspective presented. However, it effectively engages with the concern by highlighting the importance of faith in Jesus and the implications of His role as judge in shaping believers' lives."
