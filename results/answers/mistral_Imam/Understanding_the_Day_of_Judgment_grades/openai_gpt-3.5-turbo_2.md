## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Day_of_Judgment.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim, I believe in the Final Judgment Day (Qiyama) when every soul will be called upon to account for their deeds during their lifetime. In this context, the belief in the role of Jesus Christ (Isa al-Masih in Arabic) as one of the judges on that day is based on certain Hadiths and Qur'anic verses, although it is not a central or predominant aspect of Islamic beliefs about him.

According to some Hadiths, such as Sahih Bukhari (34:256) and Sahih Muslim (178-179), Jesus Christ will descend back to Earth on the Day of Judgment. Among other things, he is said to lead people in prayers, break the cross, kill swine, and abolish the Jizya tax (a tax levied on non-Muslims living under Islamic rule).

In Surah Al-Imran (3:45), it is mentioned that Jesus will speak to the people on the Day of Judgment: "And remember, I (Jesus) informed you of this before. And I concealed from you (the fact) which you have disputed about." Some scholars interpret this verse as a sign that Jesus will act as one of the judges on that day, although the Quran does not explicitly state this role for him.

It is important to note that in Islamic belief, only Allah possesses complete knowledge and has the ultimate authority as judge. The presence of other figures like Jesus Christ on the Day of Judgment serves primarily as a testimony to their prophethood and guidance.

In summary, while the role of Jesus Christ as one of the judges on the Day of Judgment is mentioned in some Hadiths and interpreted from certain Qur'anic verses, it does not diminish or change the belief that Allah alone is the only true judge on that day.

Grade: 80

Comment: The response provides a thorough explanation of the Islamic perspective on the role of Jesus Christ on the Day of Judgment, citing relevant Hadiths and Qur'anic verses. It acknowledges his presence as a judge in Islamic belief, albeit not as the ultimate judge like Allah. The response could have further emphasized the unique Christian belief in Jesus as the judge based on His sinlessness and divinity, contrasting it with the Islamic perspective presented. However, it effectively engages with the concern by highlighting the importance of faith in Jesus and the implications of His role as judge in shaping believers' lives.
