The response focused more on the Islamic beliefs rather than evaluating or comparing them with the Christian perspective. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the role of Jesus on the Day of Judgment in Islam, it does not affirm or refute the Christian belief that Jesus, being sinless and possessing the perfect character of God, will judge people based on their lives and relationship with Him."
