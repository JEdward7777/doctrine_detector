However, from a Christian worldview, it is important to clarify that Jesus Christ's role as judge is not attributed to His prophethood or guidance, but rather to His divine nature as the Son of God. As Christians, we believe that Jesus will judge based on individuals' acceptance or rejection of Him as Lord and Savior. The response could have emphasized this distinction more clearly."
