  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComments: The response provides a general overview of the concept of the \"House of God\" in biblical context, referencing the Temple in Jerusalem and the Tabernacle. However, it falls short in discussing the deeper significance and theological implications of the term within Christianity specifically. The inclusion of an Islamic perspective, while informative, may dilute the focus on a Christian worldview. To improve, the student should delve deeper into the theological significance of the \"House of God\" within Christianity and highlight key biblical teachings related to this concept."
