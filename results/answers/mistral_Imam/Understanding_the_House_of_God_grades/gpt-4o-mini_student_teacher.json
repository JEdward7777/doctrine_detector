  "grade_comment": "Grade: 70\n\nComment: The student provided a well-informed answer that demonstrates a good understanding of the concept of \"house of God\" in the Biblical context. They accurately referenced the Temple in Jerusalem and the Tabernacle in the Old Testament. However, the student's answer slightly veered off track by mentioning their background as an Imam and inviting further exploration within Islam, which is not directly relevant to the biblical concept being discussed. Overall, a solid response with room for improvement in staying focused on the Christian perspective."
