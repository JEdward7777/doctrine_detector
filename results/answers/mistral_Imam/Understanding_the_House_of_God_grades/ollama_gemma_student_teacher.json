  "grade_comment": "**Grade:** 85/100\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer provides a comprehensive and accurate definition of the term \"House of God\" in the biblical context. It correctly highlights its significance as a sacred place for worship and mentions the famous Temple in Jerusalem as an example. Additionally, the student acknowledges the variations in interpretation among different religious groups and scholars. However, including the reference to the Islamic term \"Bayt Allah\" and the Imam's perspective adds an unnecessary element that is not relevant to the Christian-specific worldview."
