It acknowledges the significance and meaning of the term in Scripture, aligning well with the concern provided. The mention of the Temple in Jerusalem and the Tabernacle from Exodus further strengthens the explanation from a Christian perspective. The invitation to explore the concept within one's faith tradition and consult knowledgeable scholars adds depth to the response. Overall, a well-informed and thorough explanation."
