  "grade_comment": "Grade: 85\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of the term \"House of God\" in a Biblical context, referencing specific examples like the Temple in Jerusalem and the Tabernacle. It effectively addresses the concern by clarifying the significance and meaning of the term in Scripture. The mention of potential variations in interpretation among different religious groups and scholars is a thoughtful addition. A stronger connection to a Christian perspective or theological reflection could further enhance the response."
