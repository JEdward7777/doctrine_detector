The inclusion of relevant Biblical references enhances the explanation. However, the response could further strengthen its Christian-specific perspective by emphasizing the theological significance and spiritual symbolism of the \"house of God\" in Scripture, linking it to themes of divine presence, holiness, and worship in the Christian faith."
