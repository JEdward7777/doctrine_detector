  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the term \"house of God\" in the Biblical context, tying it specifically to places of worship like the tabernacle or the temple. The reference to Exodus 25:8 further supports the explanation. The response effectively addresses the concern by elucidating the significance and meaning of 'house of God' in Scripture from a Christian perspective. The only slight deduction in score is due to the lack of direct integration of a Christian worldview or theological reflection in the response."
