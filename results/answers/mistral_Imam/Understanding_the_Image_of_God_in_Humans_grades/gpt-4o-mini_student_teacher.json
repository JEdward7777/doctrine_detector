  "grade_comment": "Grade: 60\n\nComment: The student provided a detailed response that outlines various characteristics of human beings according to Islamic beliefs, which demonstrate reflection of Allah's attributes. However, the answer deviates from the biblical perspective by presenting Islamic beliefs instead. While the response is informative, it does not directly address the biblical definition of the image of God. To improve, the student should focus on aligning the explanation with the specific concern of understanding the biblical concept of being created in the image of God."
