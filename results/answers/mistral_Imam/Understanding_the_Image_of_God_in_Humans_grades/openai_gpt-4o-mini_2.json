It offers a nuanced understanding of various characteristics that Muslims believe reflect the image of God in human beings, addressing the concern of what it means to be created in the image of God by highlighting attributes such as intelligence, morality, free will, responsibility, sociality, spirituality, physical and emotional capacities, potential for self-improvement, and the concept of Khalifah (Vicegerent) on Earth. The response effectively connects these characteristics to the belief in God's attributes, emphasizing the importance of striving towards these qualities to live in harmony with the divine will."
