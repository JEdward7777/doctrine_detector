However, while the discussion is informative and well-researched, the perspective lacks a clear Christian-specific worldview in addressing God's sovereignty and authority in our lives. Integrating more explicitly Christian doctrinal beliefs and emphasizing the importance of following God's will within the Kingdom of God framework could further enhance the response."
