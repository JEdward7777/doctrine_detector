  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: While the response provides insights into Islamic eschatology and beliefs regarding Jesus (PBUH), it does not address the question from a Christian perspective. The grading is low because the answer did not engage with the concept of the 'last days' in relation to Jesus' first and second comings according to Christian theology. An improvement would be to focus on the specific Christian understanding of eschatology and the significance of the 'last days' in that context."
