## Question [Understanding the Last Days](../../../questions/Understanding_the_Last_Days.md)
What do the 'last days' signify in relation to Jesusâ€™ first and second comings?

The 'last days' refer to the time beginning with Jesus' first coming and ending with His second coming and the final day of judgment.

## Stated Concern
It is essential to understand the timeline of major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith.

## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Last_Days.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim Imam, I would like to clarify that Islam does not recognize the concept of Jesus' (Peace Be Upon Him) second coming or any notion of a "rapture" in a Christian sense. In Islamic eschatology, we believe in the Day of Judgment and the return of Jesus at the end of time as a sign that the world is drawing to a close.

The term "last days" does not necessarily refer to the timing of Jesus' (PBUH) return but rather describes the signs that precede the end of the world as we know it. In Islamic tradition, these signs are described in Hadiths and include events such as widespread corruption, the appearance of the Antichrist, and the emergence of knowledge being shared without a teacher or a book (i.e., widespread literacy).

In terms of Jesus' (PBUH) first coming, Islam believes that he was born miraculously to the Virgin Mary (Maryam) through divine intervention. Muslims regard him as one of the greatest prophets sent by God, and his life, teachings, and mission are highly respected in Islamic tradition.

It is important to note that interpretations of eschatological events can vary among Muslim scholars and communities. As a Muslim Imam, I invite anyone seeking further guidance on these matters to consult reputable religious scholars and engage in ongoing study and reflection, guided by the Quran and authentic Hadiths.

Grade: 20

Comment: The student's answer, while informative about Islamic beliefs regarding the end times and Jesus (PBUH), does not address the Christian perspective on the 'last days' in relation to Jesus' first and second comings. It misses the essential Christian understanding of these events and their significance for Christian faith. The response does not align with the concern provided, which emphasizes the importance of understanding major Biblical events and their implications for Christian belief.
