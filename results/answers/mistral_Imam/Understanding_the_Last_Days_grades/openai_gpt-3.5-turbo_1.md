# Question [Understanding the Last Days](../../../questions/Understanding_the_Last_Days.md)
What do the 'last days' signify in relation to Jesusâ€™ first and second comings?

# Correct Answer
The 'last days' refer to the time beginning with Jesus' first coming and ending with His second coming and the final day of judgment.

# Stated Concern
It is essential to understand the timeline of major Biblical events and their implications for Christian faith.

# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 As a Muslim Imam, I would like to clarify that Islam does not recognize the concept of Jesus' (Peace Be Upon Him) second coming or any notion of a "rapture" in a Christian sense. In Islamic eschatology, we believe in the Day of Judgment and the return of Jesus at the end of time as a sign that the world is drawing to a close.

The term "last days" does not necessarily refer to the timing of Jesus' (PBUH) return but rather describes the signs that precede the end of the world as we know it. In Islamic tradition, these signs are described in Hadiths and include events such as widespread corruption, the appearance of the Antichrist, and the emergence of knowledge being shared without a teacher or a book (i.e., widespread literacy).

In terms of Jesus' (PBUH) first coming, Islam believes that he was born miraculously to the Virgin Mary (Maryam) through divine intervention. Muslims regard him as one of the greatest prophets sent by God, and his life, teachings, and mission are highly respected in Islamic tradition.

It is important to note that interpretations of eschatological events can vary among Muslim scholars and communities. As a Muslim Imam, I invite anyone seeking further guidance on these matters to consult reputable religious scholars and engage in ongoing study and reflection, guided by the Quran and authentic Hadiths.

Grade: 30

Comment: The response by the Muslim Imam accurately represents Islamic beliefs about Jesus and eschatology, but it does not address the concern regarding the Christian understanding of the timeline of major Biblical events. Additionally, the response does not align with Christian beliefs on the concept of Jesus' second coming and the 'rapture' as described in the Bible. The grade reflects the lack of addressing the specified concern from a Christian worldview.
