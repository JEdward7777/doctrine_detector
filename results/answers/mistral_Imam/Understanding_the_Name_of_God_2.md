## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the Old Testament, as found in Jewish and Christian scriptures, the name "Yahweh" (commonly pronounced as YHWH or Jehovah) is a significant divine name. It comes from the Hebrew verb "to be," conveying the concept of self-existence or eternity. In Judaism, it is considered too sacred to pronounce and is often replaced with "Adonai" (Lord).

In Islamic tradition, Muslims do not use this specific name for God. Instead, the Arabic name of God, Allah, is used, which shares a similar meaning â€“ the One Who Exists by Himself, without any beginning or end. The Quran acknowledges and respects the sacredness of divine names in the previous scriptures while emphasizing the unique and supreme nature of Allah as understood in Islam.
