However, the response falls short in presenting a distinctively Christian perspective. The inclusion of Islamic beliefs about Jesus detracts from focusing on the Christian understanding of salvation through Him. Moreover, the explanation lacks depth in exploring the theological significance of Jesus' divinity, sacrificial death, and resurrection in relation to the Old Testament judges. Further emphasis on the fulfillment of prophecies and the unique nature of Jesus as the Son of God would have strengthened the response."
