They have acknowledged the similarities and differences between the Christian and Islamic beliefs regarding Jesus. However, the essay could have further emphasized the continuity of the biblical narrative regarding salvation and delved deeper into how the Old Testament judges specifically foreshadowed Jesus as the ultimate Savior. More direct connections to the teacher's reference answer would have strengthened the analysis."
