# Answer by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic tradition, we respect all revealed scriptures as sources of guidance for humanity, including the Torah, which forms part of the Old Testament. The concept of judges or deliverers (Nabi, Nabi Mala'ikah) in the Torah serves as a reminder of God's mercy towards His people and their reliance on Him to provide salvation through righteous leaders.

In the Christian narrative, Jesus Christ is seen as the ultimate embodiment of this concept of salvation. Similar to the judges in the Old Testament, He is believed to have come as a deliverer to guide humanity back to God. However, unlike earthly judges who were human leaders, Jesus Christ was both fully divine and human, with the power to save humankind from sin through His life, teachings, death, and resurrection.

Jesus' role as the ultimate Savior can be inferred by understanding that He fulfilled prophecies (such as the messianic prophecies), performed miracles, and taught about God's love and mercyâ€”all qualities that make Him a perfect deliverer. This perspective emphasizes that Jesus Christ, like the judges before Him, was sent to save humanity from spiritual bondage, but He offers eternal salvation instead of temporal deliverance.

While Christians believe that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Old Testament's concept of saviors, Muslims hold a different belief about the role of Jesus in human history. In Islam, Jesus (known as Isa) is considered one of the great prophets who were sent to guide humankind, but He was not divine and did not bear the burden of original sin or die for mankind's redemption. Instead, in Islamic tradition, Muslims believe that it is through faith in Allah and following His guidance as revealed in the Quran that one can achieve salvation.

In summary, while both traditions share a common thread in the concept of saviors, they differ in their understanding of Jesus' role. The Old Testament's judges and deliverers inform our understanding of Jesus Christ in the New Testament by providing a foundation for His role as the ultimate Savior who offers eternal salvation through faith in Him.

Comment: The response effectively connects the concept of Old Testament judges as precursors to Jesus Christ as the ultimate Savior in providing eternal salvation. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the continuity in the biblical narrative regarding salvation, emphasizing the fulfillment of prophecies and the unique role of Jesus as both fully divine and human in contrast to the judges. The connection between the temporary nature of the Old Testament judges and the eternal salvation provided by Jesus is well articulated. The response maintains a coherent Christian worldview throughout its analysis.
