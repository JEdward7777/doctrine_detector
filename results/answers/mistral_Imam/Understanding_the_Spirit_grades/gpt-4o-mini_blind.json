However, it lacks depth in doctrinal understanding and fails to highlight key theological concepts. To improve, the student should incorporate more specific references to Biblical teachings on evil spirits, such as the rebellion of Satan and his fallen angels, the role of demonic oppression, and the authority of Jesus over evil spirits as demonstrated in the New Testament. Additionally, the answer could benefit from a clearer emphasis on the ultimate victory of Christ over evil and the importance of spiritual discernment in distinguishing between the human spirit and malevolent forces."
