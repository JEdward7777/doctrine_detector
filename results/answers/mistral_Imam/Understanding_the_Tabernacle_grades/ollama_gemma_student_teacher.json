While it mentions the Tabernacle's purpose in bringing people closer to Allah and fulfilling religious obligations, it is irrelevant to the given question which focuses on the tabernacle's purpose for the Israelites in the desert. Additionally, the answer contains Islamic references and terminology which is not appropriate for assessing the biblical understanding of the tabernacle from a Christian perspective."
