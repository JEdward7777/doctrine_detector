However, the integration of Islamic traditions, mentioning Prophet Moses in an Islamic context, and the Quranic reference may dilute the Christian specific worldview in addressing the concern. A more focused explanation from a Christian perspective on the tabernacle's role as a divine dwelling place and its significance in the Israelites' relationship with God would have been more appropriate."
