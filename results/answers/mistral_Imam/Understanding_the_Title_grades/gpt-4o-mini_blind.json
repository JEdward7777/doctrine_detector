  "grade_comment": "Grade: 40\n\nComment: The response provides a clear explanation of how the term \"Son of Man\" is understood in Islamic theology, which is informative. However, the answer does not address the Christian perspective on the significance of the title \"Son of Man\" in Jesus' identity. It is important to focus on the Christian view when discussing this topic. Additionally, the explanation of Jesus' role and nature in Islam, while relevant, deviates from the specific question about the title \"Son of Man.\" To improve the grade, the response should incorporate a discussion on the Christian understanding of the title and its implications for Jesus' identity."
