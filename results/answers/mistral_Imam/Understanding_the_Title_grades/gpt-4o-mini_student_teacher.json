However, the answer did not address the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' in the context of His identity from a Christian worldview, which was the specific concern given. The Christian perspective emphasizes Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, which was not highlighted in the student's response."
