  "grade_comment": "**Grade: 70/100**\n\n**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern by clarifying that the title \"Son of Man\" in Islamic theology is understood metaphorically, emphasizing Jesus' humanity and prophetic role. However, the answer lacks clarity in explaining the significance of this title within a Christian worldview, as it primarily focuses on Islamic perspectives. The response also deviates from the reference answer by stating that Jesus is fully human and fully divine, which is a belief specific to Christianity."
