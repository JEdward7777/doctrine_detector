## [Answer](../Understanding_the_Title.md) by [mistral Imam](../../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In Islamic theology, the term "Son of Man" as it appears in the Gospels does not imply a literal or physical sonship between Jesus (peace be upon him) and God. Instead, it is understood metaphorically to emphasize Jesus' humanity and his role as a prophet and messenger of God. The phrase "the Son of Man" can be found 81 times in the New Testament, most often used by Jesus himself. It is important to note that in Islam, all prophets are considered to be the slaves of Allah (God), including Jesus, and they do not share any divine essence with Him.

The Quran presents Jesus as a significant figure who was born miraculously through the virgin Mary by the permission of God and with the help of Gabriel (Jibril). He was given signs and taught the Scripture and wisdom during his life, but Islam rejects any belief in his divinity or physical sonship to God.

In conclusion, the title "Son of Man" in Islamic context refers metaphorically to Jesus' humanity and prophetic role, emphasizing that he is one of the great messengers sent by Allah to guide mankind.

**Grade: 70/100**

**Comment:** The student's answer adequately addresses the concern by clarifying that the title "Son of Man" in Islamic theology is understood metaphorically, emphasizing Jesus' humanity and prophetic role. However, the answer lacks clarity in explaining the significance of this title within a Christian worldview, as it primarily focuses on Islamic perspectives. The response also deviates from the reference answer by stating that Jesus is fully human and fully divine, which is a belief specific to Christianity.
