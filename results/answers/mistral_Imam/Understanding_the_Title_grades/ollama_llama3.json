Instead, it presents an Islamic perspective on the term \"Son of Man\" and its metaphorical meaning in Jesus' humanity and prophetic role.\n\nWhile the response provides a clear explanation of Islamic theology regarding the term \"Son of Man,\" it does not engage with the concern or provide any insights into its implications for Christian faith. The answer provided is also not directly related to the given concern, as it focuses on an Islamic perspective rather than exploring the significance of Jesus' self-identification.\n\nTo improve this response, it would be helpful to address the concern and explore the implications of Jesus' self-identification as the \"Son of Man\" for Christian faith. This could involve discussing the biblical context of the term, its connection to Christ's divinity, and its role in shaping Christian theology and worship."
