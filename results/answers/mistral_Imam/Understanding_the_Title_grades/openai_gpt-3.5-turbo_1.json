However, it did not directly address the significance of Jesus' self-identification as the 'Son of Man' and its implications for faith from a Christian worldview. The focus was primarily on Islamic theology rather than providing insights into the Christian understanding of this title. It would have been beneficial to include how Christians interpret Jesus' use of this title in relation to his divinity and messianic role."
