However, the response falls short in fully engaging with the implications for faith from a Christian perspective. It lacks an analysis of how Jesus' dual nature as fully human and fully divine, as signified by the title 'Son of Man,' impacts Christian beliefs and doctrine, which is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation."
