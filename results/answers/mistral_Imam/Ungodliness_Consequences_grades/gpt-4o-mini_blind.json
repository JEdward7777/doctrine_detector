While the information is informative and respectful, it lacks a clear focus on God's specific consequences for ungodly people according to the content of the question. Additionally, it could have delved deeper into the scriptural basis for these teachings within Islam. Incorporating more specific references to the consequences pronounced by God on ungodly individuals would have strengthened the response."
