  "grade_comment": "Grade: 50\n\nComment: The student provides a thorough explanation of Islamic teachings regarding consequences for ungodly behavior, but does not directly address the Christian-specific worldview. The response lacks a clear connection to the reference answer from a Christian perspective regarding God's judgment and wrath towards ungodly individuals. It is important to ensure that the response aligns with the given concern and viewpoint when discussing spiritual ramifications of disobedience to God."
