However, the response does not directly align with the given answer in terms of focusing solely on God's judgment and wrath towards ungodly people who reject Him. The overall insight provided on the consequences of actions in Islam is well-explained and relevant to the concern, but there is room for more direct alignment between the answer and the response."
