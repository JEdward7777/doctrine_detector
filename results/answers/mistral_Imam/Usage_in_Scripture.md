## Answer given by [mistral Imam](../../answering_models/mistral_Imam.md)
 In the context of the Old Testament (Tanakh), the term "Holy One" is often used to refer to God, highlighting His unique and set-apart nature. This name for God emphasizes His otherness, separateness, and distinctiveness from all created beings. It appears in various books such as Isaiah (1:4, 40:25), Jeremiah (5:23, 16:19), Ezekiel (20:26, 36:23), among others.

In the New Testament, the term "Holy One" is also used to describe God, emphasizing His divine and transcendent qualities. It's used in passages like Mark 1:24, where it refers to Jesus casting out a demon that cried out, "What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you areâ€”the Holy One of God!" Here, the term serves as recognition and acknowledgement of Jesus' divine identity.

In addition, the New Testament also uses the term "Holy One" to describe individuals who have been set apart for God's purposes, such as Mary (Luke 1:43), Peter (Acts 3:14), and certain disciples (Acts 9:13). In these cases, it emphasizes their purity and dedication to God.

It is important to note that while Muslims believe in the same Abrahamic God as the Judeo-Christian tradition, our understanding of God's nature may differ due to the unique aspects of Islamic theology and practice. Nevertheless, recognizing shared roots and terminologies such as "Holy One" can facilitate a deeper understanding between our traditions and promote interfaith dialogue and cooperation.
