  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The response effectively explains the usage of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing its significance in highlighting God's unique and set-apart nature. The student accurately relates the term to God's divine qualities and its application to individuals set apart for God's purposes in the New Testament. However, the mention of Islamic theology and practice at the end of the response, while seeking to promote interfaith dialogue, may detract from the focus on the specific Christian understanding of the term \"Holy One\" within the context of the question."
