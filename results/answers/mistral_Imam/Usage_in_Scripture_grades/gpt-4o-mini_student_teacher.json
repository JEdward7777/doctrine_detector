  "grade_comment": "Grade: 80\n\nComment: The student provided a comprehensive overview of the usage of the term \"Holy One\" in both the Old and New Testaments, highlighting its significance in referring to God's unique and divine nature. The student accurately pointed out references in various books of the Old Testament and correctly identified instances in the New Testament, including the recognition of Jesus as the \"Holy One.\" However, the student's answer could have been improved by explicitly connecting the term to the authority and divinity of Jesus as seen in the New Testament, as specified in the concern."
