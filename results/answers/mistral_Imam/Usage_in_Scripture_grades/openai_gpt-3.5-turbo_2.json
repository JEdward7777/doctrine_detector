It effectively addresses the concern by highlighting Jesus' divine identity through scriptural references. The response also acknowledges the significance of individuals being set apart for God's purposes. However, a stronger emphasis on the unique divinity of Jesus in relation to the term \"Holy One\" could further enhance the Christian-specific worldview perspective."
